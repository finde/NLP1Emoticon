[00:03] <radioaktivstorm> cigr, did you make any progress on the bcm43xx?
[00:03] <FredThompson> NineTeen67Comet, Then why are you complaining about it?
[00:03] <cigr> no, unfortunately not
[00:03] <Ashfire908> aleka, and then you reboot the system with the disk in the drive.

[00:16] <Boumboum5> sylpou: the cd should be fine unless you want the universe repository stored locally.
[00:16] <schecky4> jdong: oh, thats not terrible.  thanks
[00:16] <agwells> Boumboum5: no, try pluging in a usb Device NOW, and see if USB works.....? i have HP dv6000 series
[00:17] <sylpou_> ok thanks guy .. and is there a way to clone the drive like Ghost or Acronis under ubuntu ?
[00:17] <flick> if i want to switch to KDE, the way i do it is install kubuntu-desktop and remove gnome-core?
[00:17] <Pelo> Colro,  in OOo,  under  tool > options > display , there is an option to match your desktop theme or some thign like that
[00:17] <jdong> ronald_: I am not familiar with what that redhat config file does. please elaborate?
[00:17] <kikkertje> garu, i'm using the fglrx driver
[00:17] <Keule|on> there is a problem with my rights on ubuntu - and i dot know how to fix
[00:17] <Ashfire908> colro, what oo themes do you hav installed
[00:17] <Boumboum5> ubotu is a bot. :)

[00:17] <steven43126> I'm installing gutsy and already have and LVM parition with a / and /home partition these don't show up when using manual partition from the install cd how do i keep my LVM /home partition ?
[00:17] <Colro> Ashfire908: none
[00:17] <jdong> schecky4: sure thing. Michael (the guy who runs Phoronix, beta-tester for ATI/AMD too) has implied quite some good words about the driver, and that it's on track for timely release

[00:17] <jdong> schecky4: as an owner of a mobility x1400, I can't wait.
[00:17] <saloxin> steven43126: you have to use the alternate cd for lvm/raid setups
[00:18] <Ashfire908> Colro, you are checking in synaptic, right?
[00:18] <Keule|on> nur da ist niemand zur hilfe bereit!
[00:18] <steven43126> saloxin, ah my bad, thanks
[00:18] <Keule|on> there is noone - who wanna help
[00:18] <Pelo> Colro,  in synaptic  OOo themes are called style
[00:18] <Keule|on> noone answered...
[00:18] <Keule|on> :(
[00:18] <TorvusLinalds> anyone?  some dude said to try running dpkg-configure xserver-xorg but i dunno what do do next, and he isn't replying.. what do i have to do next?  i think my fglrx is not working properly... well, everything is really slow and there is corruption on some stuff
[00:18] <Pelo> Keule|on,  it'S not a question of want , it's a question of can
[00:18] <S0crates> I have a Xubuntu 6.04 that I just upgraded to 7.04.  However, I can only boot into low graphics mode.  How do I get the nvidia drivers working again?
[00:19] <comicinker> I'm trying to build an applicaton but get following error: qpopupmenu.h: No such file or directory      what library do I need?
[00:19] <schecky4> jdong:  hah.  i just want to be able to adjust my screen brightness without rebooting
[00:19] <TomBosley> S0crates, have you tried enabling the restricted driver?
[00:19] <agwells> Boumboum5: Whats up?
[00:19] <Boumboum5> agwells: I just did. used nautilus, unmounted my already mounted USB drive, re-mounted it, a new Nautilus window opens showing the USB's file contents. Works fine. might need to use nautilus to mount manually.
[00:19] <ronald_> var ACPI_DSDT .. en ubuntu ? .. in redhat is /etc/sysconfig/kernel
[00:19] <jnc> well, I'm back.  I haven't found an FAQ or Guide yet detailing what the best practice is to install Xen on Gutsy
[00:19] <jdong> schecky4: eep, that's rough.... my BIOS controls brightness for me via hardware-bound keys. fortunately.
[00:19] <Jordan_U> Keule|on, What are you trying to accomplish? It looks like you are doing something with Dolphin ( which I don't use ). Are you trying to transfer preferences to another install?
[00:19] <Lifeisfunny> what is happening when Totem displays a 'No Plugin to handle this DVD' warming?
[00:19] <agwells> Boumboum5: no UNPLUG it... and tell me whats up
[00:19] <Keule|on> maybe - but its not a question of the language! - i had solutions of many problems here in the englisch channel! Pelo - more then in the german one
[00:19] <saloxin> comicinker: search with apt-file
[00:19] <S0crates> TomBosley, yes, but I am still using the old "nv" driver.  When I boot, I get the new video configuration tool, but the nvidia driver is not on the list
[00:19] <Ashfire908> colro, the theme packages start with "openoffice.org-style-"
[00:20] <Jordan_U> Lifeisfunny, totem-gstreamer can't play DVD's
[00:20] <Boumboum5> Keule|on: I want to help you but I don't know the answer. :(
[00:20] <TorvusLinalds> man this sucks so badly
[00:20] <schecky4> jdong: lucky. mine has to go through ATI catalyst control and of course its not supported by the driver yet.
[00:20] <Jordan_U> Lifeisfunny, I would use vlc + libdvdcss
[00:20] <Jordan_U> !dvd | Lifeisfunny
[00:20] <ubotu> Lifeisfunny: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at !Medibuntu or (for Feisty and earlier) http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs
[00:20] <Keule|on> no - i start dolphin - or another prog - when i close it - this message is comming up
[00:20] <schecky4> jdong: oh well. as long as i can still see the display, i'm relatively happy
[00:20] <Lifeisfunny> thanks Jordan_U  :)
[00:20] <jdong> schecky4: that sucks. Hope 8.42 solves that for you. I just want answers to why 3D framerates in Linux are less than 1/2 what they are with the newest Windows drivers....
[00:20] <agwells> Boumboum5: its only if i unplug a device then plug it back in does it not resond nor work
[00:20] <rbs-tito> Does the restricted driver manager install the drivers for Atheros cards?
[00:20] <rbs-tito> (madwifi)
[00:20] <jdong> rbs-tito: atheros is installed by default
[00:20] <TorvusLinalds> has ANYONE managed to get fglrx working on an ATI mobility radeon 9600?
[00:20] <jnc> rbs-tito: interesting question
[00:20] <flick> which one offers most features out of ubuntu,kubuntu,xubuntu,edubuntu etc.?
[00:21] <Jordan_U> Lifeisfunny, np :)
[00:21] <ronald_> kernel var .. /etc/sysconfig/kernel  ... en ubuntu ??
[00:21] <Keule|on> its a pitty....all the guys who are not ment... answering ...
[00:21] <crdlb> rbs-tito, it activates the ath_hal module
[00:21] <akiratheoni> @flick, you can just install ubuntu then install kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop
=== PhilAirtime is now known as CharlesKennedy
[00:21] <schecky4> jdong: yeah, the driver only fully supports 2D acceleration now
[00:21] <agwells> Boumboum5: and it had to be plugged in to from when i booted the OS
[00:21] <crdlb> but it's done automatically (so it just provides a way to diable it)
=== CharlesKennedy is now known as PhilAirtime
[00:21] <jdong> rbs-tito: unless you have a new AR53xx/54xx/5008x card, in which case you need madwifi from SVN
[00:21] <saloxin> Keule|on: you haven't show the error message?
[00:21] <akiratheoni> then you get all the features of ubuntu, kubuntu, and xubuntu
[00:21] <Jordan_U> flick, They all use the same repositories, it's just different default applications
[00:21] <Ashfire908> rbs-tito, if there is a restricted driver available, and needed, it will be in there.
[00:21] <schecky4> jdong: 3D is "questionable" to say the least
[00:21] <Keule|on> http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/16541/
[00:21] <Boumboum5> Socrates: System|Administration|Restricted Driver Management      Go there and click on "enable". If it's already enabled, then disable it...wait a little bit...then re-enable, It should re-install it for you.
=== Moniker42 is now known as TonyBlair
[00:21] <Keule|on> i did - but its german - sorry
[00:21] <ZaphodBeeblebrox> Hi everyone
[00:21] <rbs-tito> crdlb & jnc: Will I need to be connected to the internet in order to activate it?
[00:21] <gavintlgold> hey, i have a question: I noticed that I have a whole bunch of different versions of linux-restricted-modules installed. Might this be a reason X doesn't work for me? I uninstalled all now, except for the one marked with the Ubuntu logo in synaptic
[00:21] <jdong> schecky4: 3D "works" here, but I never realized how powerful this GPU was until I used XP for a few days a month ago.
[00:22] <ronald_> kernel var .. /etc/sysconfig/kernel  ... en ubuntu ??
=== TonyBlair is now known as GordonBrown
[00:22] <ronald_> var ACPI_DSDT .. en ubuntu ? .. in redhat is /etc/sysconfig/kernel
[00:22] <crdlb> rbs-tito, no
[00:22] <akiratheoni> hey, does anyone know how to change the screen resolution of the login screen for 7.10? my default resolution is 1680x1050 and it's the only resolution that appears in my xorg.conf, but the login screen uses something like 800x600
[00:22] <ZaphodBeeblebrox> I'm here to what I promise to: "I love Gutsy! Everything works perfectly" :D
[00:22] <Boumboum5> agwells: that breaks the system. you have to unmount first before you unplug the device. right-click on the drive, popup should show...should be an item called "unmount"
[00:22] <Ashfire908> colro, try installing "openoffice.org-style-tango"
=== GordonBrown is now known as Moniker42
[00:22] <schecky4> jdong: i dual-boot (so i can still play my MMORPG's) on windows so i'm constantly reminded =/
[00:22] <wirchief1> Torvuslinalds check my pm
[00:23] <flick> if i want to completely switch over to KDE, is there any easy way to get rid of the gnome applications?
[00:23] <jnc> ronald_: is that a sysctl setting?
[00:23] <saloxin> Keule|on: ls -l /home/keule/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/bookmarks.xml?
[00:23] <rbs-tito> flick: Ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage with most of the gnome programs
[00:23] <Dr_willis_> flick,  why bother. leave them there -  incase you find one you like.
[00:23] <cdm10> Why was Gutsy released with this OpenOffice problem?
[00:23] <agwells> Boumboum5: what if its a mouse or gamepad
[00:23] <Keule|on> saloxin: whats this?
[00:23] <erisco> I am having a problem compiling something with gcc, as it says it could not find cc1plus. I have done a lot of searching, and every time it says to install g++. Well, I did install the c++ compiler but cc1plus still does not exist. cc1 does exist, just not cc1plus... and the repository shows no results for cc1plus. help!
[00:23] <akiratheoni> just wondering, what OO.org problem?
[00:23] <gavintlgold> well i'm going to see how it goes :) hope I get good x back
[00:23] <agwells> Boumboum5: wait... no if its booted and the device gets pluged in it doesnt work....
[00:23] <jnc> erisco: g++ is not c++
[00:23] <fgsedgwick> I seem to have both madwifi and madwifi-ng installed on my Dapper Drake system.  Is this OK?
[00:23] <saloxin> Keule|on: showing owner and permissions of the file mentioned in your error message
[00:24] <schecky4> jdong: hey, thanks for the info. im going to head out
[00:24] <ronald_> jnc, var ACPI_DSDT ? in sysctl ?
[00:24] <Keule|on> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1159 2007-10-20 19:29 /home/keule/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/bookmarks.xml
[00:24] <erisco> jnc, regardless, I installed g++
[00:24] <jdong> schecky4: sure thing
[00:24] <cdm10> akiratheoni: i, and a few other people, have noticed that OOo's buttons only show up as text, no icons, and you need to install openoffice.org-style-tango
[00:24] <Ashfire908> erisco: install build-essential
[00:24] <jnc> ronald_: if you modify /procc/...something/or/other
[00:24] <akiratheoni> oh okay
[00:24] <flick> Dr_willis, if you say so... two reasons i was worried, one is space (which is alright still) and two is if i run the gnome applications by mistake it will be slow in kde?
[00:24] <TorvusLinalds> someone please help me get my fglrx working...   it was working in Feisty but now it's shafted
[00:24] <ZaphodBeeblebrox> Guys, just one question: I just installed thunderbird and I already had a .mozilla-thunderbird in my #HOME. Can I just run it and everything will work or I'll have to do some Import procedures?
[00:24] <jnc> erisco: try installing build-essential
[00:24] <cdm10> ZaphodBeeblebrox: it'll just work
[00:24] <Boumboum5> agwells: I am still new-ish to Ubuntu. Driver support for non-flash/hd USB devices is kinda spotty I think. You may need to install special linux/Ubuntu drivers for your USB device to get it to work properly.
[00:24] <ZaphodBeeblebrox> cdm10: Cool! Thanks

[00:24] <cdm10> Boumboum5: everything I use works fine... what's not working for you?
=== mgk is now known as Mgk
[00:25] <erisco> Ashfire908, jnc, I thought that was now included with ubuntu. seems I didn't have it installed... lemme try this again
[00:25] <agwells> Boumboum5: this happens for any usb device
[00:25] <agwells> Boumboum5: even my pen drive
[00:25] <saloxin> Keule|on: cd /home/keule; sudo chown -R keule *
[00:25] <Keule|on> so what can i do saloxin
[00:25] <Keule|on> ?
[00:25] <Boumboum5> agwells: Hm. is the pen drive formatted? What filesystem?
[00:25] <livingdaylight> can i install Dolphin on ubuntu?
[00:25] <Rolenun> is the Intel x86 usable with Intel 64-bit, or am I supposed to use AMD64 instead? :)
[00:25] <saloxin> Keule|on: be very careful you are in you home dir first
[00:25] <ZaphodBeeblebrox> Well, time for me to go now. Thanks to everyone who got involved in my Gutsy issues in the past 2 days. You guys are great and after a clean install I have no complaints whatsoever. Thanks guys, keep up with the awesome work!
[00:26] <Keule|on> whats *
[00:26]  * Boumboum5 just realized he has his usb mouse with him and tries it out on Ubuntu by plugging it in...
[00:26] <erisco> jnc, I thought g++ was to compile c++ and gcc was to compile C?
[00:26] <agwells> Boumboum5: everything worked in 7.04... now usb is broken in 7.10
[00:26] <thx1137> akiratheoni: you can manually add your resolution in xorg.conf (http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=129379&postcount=21)
[00:26] <jnc> erisco: generally speaking, if I want to compile version X+1 of package foo, I will do apt-get build-dep fooX
[00:26] <Keule|on> it says missing operand
[00:26] <saloxin> Keule|on: it's a wildcard. it means everything
[00:26] <Ashfire908> colro, install "openoffice.org-style-andromeda", "openoffice.org-style-crystal", and "openoffice.org-style-industrial" too if you want.
[00:26] <robert232323_> i was finally able to install drivers for wireless usb device, but when i plug it in, everything freezes
[00:26] <jnc> erisco: c++ is a preprocessor, that's just how the names of things worked out.  g++ is the C++ compiler
[00:26] <Keule|on> chown: fehlender Operand nach „keule“
[00:26] <Keule|on> „chown --help“ gibt weitere Informationen.
[00:26] <erisco> jnc, specifically speaking I am trying to install opioid2d for python... and right now it is trying to take source and compile it
[00:27] <Keule|on> fehlender Operand = missing operand
[00:27] <speaker219> Wow
[00:27] <speaker219> The ubuntu servers seem to have sped up a bit
[00:27] <jnc> erisco: yeah I would find something similar and build-dep it
[00:27] <speaker219> i'm getting 500 kB/s
[00:27] <Atlantiz> sweet
[00:27] <cdm10> So... why does openoffice.org get installed with no style packages by default? Someone must have messed up something there...
[00:27] <erisco> jnc, I am not familiar with this build-dep
[00:27] <Boumboum5> speaker: less of a load on them now that upgrade day is over :)
[00:27] <agwells> Boumboum5: what hp Laptop are you using?
[00:27] <User667> can anyone offer help with the suspend feature?
[00:28] <robert232323_> does anyone know how to configure a wireless usb device / connection
[00:28] <erisco> jnc, see, opioid2d is written in c++ so I am very confused as to why gcc is throwing an error... it should be using g++ no?
[00:28] <jnc> erisco: build-dep is an apt operation which installs all pre-requisite development packages for the target debian package.  This works in Ubuntu, or any apt based system too
[00:28] <Boumboum5> agwells: Ok I see my usb mouse does not work in Ubuntu--it is not recognized. pen drive works fine. I have a Pavilion dv900t
[00:28] <TorvusLinalds> aargh another reboot... goodbye cruel world
[00:28] <speaker219> robert232323_: what wireless card?
[00:28] <garu> right now. I'm more thinking of ubuntu 7.10 as being in a beta stage rather than a final release :o
[00:28] <jnc> erisco: gcc is a front-end for many compilers
[00:28] <thx1137> Hi, anyone have any ideas why when I choose System>Preferences>Hardware Information, the window appears and then immedately closes?
[00:28] <cdm10> !anyone | User667, robert232323
[00:28] <erisco> jnc, this isn't a deb package
[00:28] <ubotu> User667, robert232323: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[00:28] <ePax> I have installed XMMS2 with Synaptic but it does not come up in "Sound and Video".
[00:28] <ePax> In applications.
[00:28] <jnc> erisco: well, take something similar like uh.. I don't know, something written in python, and build-dep it
[00:28] <agwells> user667: there is a forum about it...google suspend ubuntu
[00:29] <erisco> jnc, this install script simply compiles the source and moves it to the appropriate location for python to see it
[00:29] <jnc> erisco: apt-get build-dep bittorrent
[00:29] <Boumboum5> thx1137: sounds like the program that runs the hardware info thing is corrupted and crashed.
[00:29] <jnc> i.e
[00:29] <robert232323_> i installed drivers for wireless usb device.. when i plug it in, it blinks, but system freezes

[00:30] <speaker219> my bad
[00:30] <akiratheoni> my login screen uses a resolution that is NOT listed in my xorg.conf. i only have ONE resolution listed in the xorg.conf, how can i change it so the login screen uses that one?
[00:30] <saloxin> agwells: don't unplug it ;-)
[00:30] <akiratheoni> i have 7.10
[00:30] <flick> right, thanks!
[00:30] <thx1137> Boumboum5: hmm, know of any way to reset it?
[00:30] <gavintlgold> i'm using gutsy
[00:30] <benzon> speaker219, cdm10  - dont think so opensuse support there you get a answer adleest
[00:30] <Boumboum5> agwells: that begins to sound like a bug in Ubuntu. You might want to file a bugreport. I have the same problemm with my wired USB mouse.
[00:30] <ePax> !xmms2
[00:30] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about xmms2 - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[00:30] <jnc> akiratheoni: good question, have no idea about the answer
[00:30] <comicinker> saloxin: so I located the package for the header file. its already installed. it belongs to a qt3 library. but the make command wont find that header file (qheader.h)
[00:30] <cdm10> benzon: you're not going to get an answer if you YELL
[00:30] <User667> "!bot | User667"? cdm10?
[00:30] <gavintlgold> I used to use the beta, and one update broke it, so i'm stuck here with failsafe x
[00:30] <flick> and the torrents for kubuntu cd?
[00:30] <saloxin> comicinker: what are you trying to compile? not available in ubuntu?
[00:30] <agwells> Boumboum5: this is a problem for a usb pen drive.... i store information... take it out come back plug it in doesnt work... need to restart computer for it to mount usb drive
[00:30] <speaker219> yes flick
[00:31] <speaker219> flick hold on
[00:31] <Boumboum5> akiratheoni: You need to edit the xorg.conf file and put in a new line for the resolution you want.
[00:31] <benzon> cdm10, aint gonna get a answer in here ever every think i ask theres no answer for it
[00:31] <jnc> so um, I do have a question, is "cli" the same as server install from the netboot images?
[00:31] <comicinker> saloxin: jahshaka, its available for dapper only
[00:31] <cdm10> User667: in case you weren't paying attention, the bot (ubotu) sent you a message both of those times. !whatever just tells the bot to tell you about whatever.
[00:31] <cdm10> benzon: that doesn't mean you should yell
[00:31] <jnc> the "cli" option from syslinux seems to hint that it's very minimal
[00:31] <Boumboum5> agwells: what laptop are you using?
[00:31] <jnc> is that more minimal than "server" install?
[00:31] <akiratheoni> boumboum: you mean for the login screen itself? how would i do that?
[00:31] <agwells> Boumboum5: HP DV6000 series
[00:32] <akiratheoni> boumboum: because i only have one resolution listed anyway in my xorg.conf
[00:32] <Boumboum5> akiratheoni: let me find a url that walks you through it...
[00:32] <saloxin> comicinker: you need to point it at the header file. ./configure --help ?

[00:32] <robdig> hi! has anyone been able to successfully upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10 with the w32codecs and libdvdcss packages from medibuntu? Upgrade manager quits with an error because it can't download them.
=== `eric is now known as `eric-
[00:33] <saloxin> robdig: disable that repo during the upgrade
[00:33] <agwells> !test | User667
[00:33] <ubotu> User667: Failed.
[00:33] <talcite> hey guys, does anyone here use 64bit?
[00:33] <Cryoniq> Anyone know how the agpgart issues and ATI driver issues coming along for 7.10?
[00:33] <User667> i am having trouble with the suspend feature
[00:33] <robdig> saloxin: thanks
[00:33] <flick> speaker219, i think i found it: http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/kubuntu/gutsy/
[00:33] <jnc> too bad nobody is jumping on my question about Gutsy and "cli" versus "server" install
[00:33] <comicinker> solaxin: ok. but i just found out: locate cant find qheader.h
[00:33] <usser> talcite: yep
[00:33] <Juice^> does anyone know the solution around getting xserver to work with parallel workstation? im unable to get it running, using the live ubuntu 7.10, and parallel running on vista..
[00:33] <joelsw_> well dvd plugin is working now thanks to who helped me find it
[00:33] <agwells> user667: there is a forum about it...google suspend ubuntu
[00:33] <Pici> jnc: You mean alternate vs server?
[00:33] <talcite> usser: what's the status with the 64bit java plugin lacking a security manger?
[00:34] <flick> speaker219, thanks
[00:34] <speaker219> flick: same thing
[00:34] <User667> ok thanks
[00:34] <saloxin> jnc: be daring - try it out
[00:34] <chrisb> Has anyone experienced Compiz working fine when using the liveCD but then not when fully installing Ubuntu 7.10?  I've scratched my head all day...installed the proprietary drivers (even though that wasn't necessary for the LiveCD) - can't enable the desktop effects even though I know my ATI x600 is fully capable.
[00:34] <speaker219> doesn't matter what mirror you get it from, it's a torrent
[00:34] <jnc> Pici: I'm booting a netboot installer, so I would like to install the server edition
[00:34] <speaker219> your welcome :)
[00:34] <comicinker> saloxin:  so how can I ad the correct path to the qt3 enviroment?
[00:34] <Boumboum5> akiratheoni: ok this one's fairly good. I had similar problems with Ubuntu 7.04  as I'm on a widescreen laptop and 7.04 didn't recognize any of the widescreen modes.    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=83973
[00:34] <usser> talcite: the gnu one? i never used it
[00:34] <Pici> jnc: er, Whats the question, sorry.
[00:34] <Intelligitimate> What is a cheap portable MP3 player that runs linux good and can do interesting things?
[00:34] <jnc> Pici: my end goal is figuring out how to configure Xen from a Gutsy install
[00:34] <Pici> jnc: Sorry, over my head :/
[00:34] <cdm10> Has anyone here had any problems with the mouse pointer disappearing when using the nVidia driver?
[00:34] <jnc> Pici: netboot installer is working, it asks if i want "install" or "cli"
[00:34] <Keule|on> saloxin: ? are you there?
[00:34] <jnc> kind of confused by these simplistic terms
[00:34] <agwells> chrisb: get envy... and have it install the drivers for you it will get all the drivers and setup your system for 3d support
[00:35] <usser> Intelligitimate: i have rockMee from chinese meelectronics
[00:35] <andrew_> does anyone know where the location of the 'home folder' icon is?
[00:35] <saloxin> comicinker: heh, there's the rub. combine ./configure with dpkg -L <qtpackage>
[00:35] <jnc> the wikis don't have this info yet
[00:35] <cdm10> jnc: I'm guessing cli just gives you a command line of some sort and install actually installs
[00:35] <speaker219> this channel is incredible. 1326 users.
[00:35] <Pici> jnc: I'd try install, cli= command like interface.
[00:35] <saloxin> Keule|on: yep. tried pm'ing you without luck
[00:35] <talcite> usser: what about the sun jre-6?
[00:35] <Boumboum5> akiratheoni: Hope that helps :)
[00:35] <chrisb> agwells: is "envy" the package name in synaptics I should search for?
[00:35] <gavintlgold> can no one help me (fixing my NVIDIA card for the restricted to work)?
[00:35] <Dr_willis_> cdm10,  not really. theres some  special settings for the mouse pointer you can enable for the nvidia drivers. Enable shadows and otehr things.
[00:35] <ZionPsyfer> jnc, cli implies that it installs a command line system without the graphical stuff
[00:35] <usser> Intelligitimate: can play flac ogg avi files, has mini sd expansion slot
[00:35] <Keule|on> what? :)
[00:35] <Pici> !envy | agwells chrisb
[00:35] <ubotu> agwells chrisb: envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[00:35] <ZionPsyfer> this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=290512 seems to support that
[00:35] <cdm10> Dr_willis: what?
[00:35] <Darkkish> I prefered beryl over compiz
[00:35] <agwells> ENVY isntalls drivers for NVIDIA and ATI
[00:35] <Cryoniq> agwells: vill envy fix the agpgart issue for ati users as well in 7.10?
[00:35] <jnc> ZionPsyfer: right... but how bare bones is this, would that be different than an Ubuntu Server install?
[00:35] <usser> talcite: its not a plugin per-se just runtime environment
[00:35] <agwells> not sure...
[00:35] <Keule|on> saloxin:  it got your message - and i anwered
[00:36] <seamus7> Are there others here who find they must use GKrellM to better manage their fans on Dell laptops as I do?
[00:36] <ZionPsyfer> yes, a server install would be geared towards running a server.
[00:36] <jnc> I don't see this being documented anywhere
[00:36] <usser> talcite: never heard of any security issues it has
[00:36] <Pici> Darkkish: Beryl and Compiz have merged to form Compiz-Fusion
[00:36] <agwells> It worked great in 7.04 and it is a PY Script
[00:36] <saloxin> Keule|on: you're not registered nick maybe. i see no answer
[00:36] <ZionPsyfer> jnc, Let me see if I can dig up a list for ya.
[00:36] <Pauleh> jesus
[00:36] <cdm10> jnc: that's because it's fairly self-explanatory... do you want a cli, or do you want an install?
[00:36] <jnc> ZionPsyfer: that'd be sweet
[00:36] <Boumboum5> agwells: Your problem is beyond my beginner's competence... I don't know how to tweak your system to get your USB devices to work properly. Hopefully someone else will know.  I need to go now.. :(
[00:36] <usser> Intelligitimate: has 1G of memory and goes for 67$ on newegg
[00:36] <talcite> usser: hmm... what are they talking about on the forums then? I'm not quite sure I understand it
[00:36] <cdm10> Dr_willis: my mouse pointer works fine for a while, then starts randomly disappearing when different pointers are used. If I disable HWCursor, it works fine, but then I can't use COmpiz.
[00:36] <Jesus> Pauleh, hm?
[00:36] <Boumboum5> speaker: yep...rather too many...everything scrolls by sooooooo fast.
[00:36] <talcite> usser: it says something about 64bit java being insecure?
[00:36] <Intelligitimate> usser, does it run linux, and what else can it do?
[00:36] <Pauleh> Jesus, woah
[00:36] <jnc> cdm10: it's not clear if "cli" == "install server"
[00:36] <summer_s4> is there a place with a "compatible hardware" list for ubuntu is?
[00:36] <talcite> usser: is that still the case for gutsy?
[00:36] <erisco> can anyone else connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com?
[00:36] <slain> hi all
[00:36] <cdm10> jnc: If the documentation you're looking at is a wiki, you could of course fix it.
[00:36] <erisco> it seems to be down

[00:37] <slain> I need some help setting up my network

[00:37] <aleka> I have an entry in my fstab for an external drive (sdc1)  to be mounted on /media/sdc1... this never works and I have to mount the partition as root... which is annoying when transferring files and stuff.. anyone interested in walking me thru the fstab setup?

[00:37] <saloxin> Keule|on: do "chown -R keule /home/keule/*"
[00:37] <jdong> erisco: you can use Prefs->Sound to "bind" your volume up/down hotkeys to change BOTH channels
[00:37] <Boumboum5> gavintlgold: should be able to re-install your nvidia driver.  go to System|Administration|Restricted Driver Management   and it'll list restricted drivers. click "enable" and it should download the right driver for you.
[00:37] <saloxin> Keule|on: without the "'s

[00:38] <cdm10> jnc: I'm not berating you for not contributing, I just said that, now that you know the answer, you could change it.
[00:38] <Darkkish> Pici, where is the settings manager for compiz**
[00:38] <talcite> usser: it's ok, thanks for your help =D

[00:38] <Intelligitimate> usser, it sounds interesting and up my alley. However, is there any more open source type stuff for it? Can I compile software in it?
[00:38] <joanki> can i restore system settings?

[00:38] <gavintlgold> Boumboum5: It says they're installed, but it doesn't work. When I uninstall them, the check is gone after a restart, but it still claims that it's "running" with the green icon... even though it obviously isn't since it's not installed
[00:38] <slain> my problem is
[00:38] <User667> "No swap partition found; userspace software suspend will not work" ?
[00:38] <slain> when I route
[00:39] <agwells> Darkkish Beryl and compiz have merged.. now Compiz Fusion,
[00:39] <gavintlgold> Boumboum5: and then when I reinstall, it doesn't work...
[00:39] <flick> probably because i'm an windows refugee, kubuntu looks much better!
[00:39] <MrKeuner> hi, which one is the apache2 user in ubuntu?
[00:39] <slain> it does not know which gateway to use for the internet

[00:39] <Keule|on> saloxin: chown -R keule /home/keule/
[00:39] <Darkkish> Pici, what about a window manager, it dissapears when i turn on compiz
[00:39] <usser> Intelligitimate: no, but i suppose u can write to the manufacturer to give out specs, i wrote to ask what was the distrib on it they never answered
[00:39] <slain> and which to use for the campus wireless
[00:39] <flick> however, i'm not getting compiz-fusion effects for some reason

[00:39] <MrKeuner> is it www-data?
[00:39] <Pici> Darkkish: ask in #compiz-fusion, sounds like a configuration issue :
[00:39] <slain> is there anyone that can help me with my problem
[00:39] <saloxin> Keule|on: ah. sudo chown -R keule /home/keule/
[00:40] <flick> how do i enable compiz-fusion on kde?
[00:40] <jnc> cdm10: is there a wiki in particular that you would like edited?

[00:40] <agwells> to change the settings sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[00:40] <Intelligitimate> usser, is there an 'open-source' type portable MP3?

[00:40] <chrisb> Where is the appropriate place to find the "envy" script for handling our video card drivers?  I don't see anything under synaptics for it...

[00:40] <gavintlgold> Boumboum5: during the beta, there was some install and it asked whether it should overwrite a file or not and I chose yes, i think that's what broke it... sadly, I don't remember what exactly it was
[00:40] <gavintlgold> but it's not a problem with xorg.conf

[00:41] <ZionPsyfer> jnc, It looks like it's indeed a minimalist install that either provides different packages from a server install.  or provides the same packages as the server install, but is done from a non server CD.   I haven't been able to find a list detailing the differences.
[00:41] <tag-> gavintlgold: that would be strange...

[00:43] <gavintlgold> i'll wait before doing that, Boumboum5 ;)
[00:43] <speaker219> I installed ccsm

[00:59] <stefg> jakamo, i do, whenever i do something with uncertain outcome
[00:59] <Ahorner> screenshot button o.O
[00:59] <elad> usr, sudo-what exactly, though?
[00:59] <zacchaeus> lsusb locks up when I look for a usb hard drive (hd stuck in an enclosure with ext3 fs from another ubuntu box that's broken) what do i do?
[00:59] <cdm10> nick4: If you install evolution, it'll automatically install whatever's necessary to run.
[00:59] <Kodemage> saloxin: yes, quite isn't it
[01:00] <jakamo> stefg: plus have you ever really tried to restore a backup?  Aint nuthin easy about it.
[01:00] <Ahorner> aaaahahaha
[01:00] <`eric-> =P
[01:00] <`eric-> here goes nothing.
[01:00] <elad> Ahorner, I don't have that button in my version.
[01:00] <Reng> what is safe to delete with kleansweep??
[01:00] <elad> Ahorner, I used to, but no more.
[01:00] <usr> its being root!
[01:00] <cdm10> jakamo: sudo dd /media/disk/backup /dev/sda
[01:00] <stefg> !backup | jakamo
[01:00] <ubotu> jakamo: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !sbackup and !cloning
[01:00] <cdm10> jakamo: or something like taht
[01:00] <nick4> cdm10 Does evolution require Gnome libs?
[01:00] <jakamo> stefg: unless you made a complete drive mirror which usually isn;t practical
[01:00] <cdm10> jakamo: if it's an image backup
[01:00] <Kodemage> saloxin: the suggestion is that she can use it, which means they're trying to keep it idiot friendly
[01:00] <elad> usr, I know what sudo is, but what should I sudo?
[01:00] <`eric-> anyone know of a good web-based IRC client?
[01:00] <stefg> jakamo, read above
[01:00] <cdm10> `eric-: java.freenode.net, but it's not good.
[01:00] <jakamo> cdm10: exactly my point
[01:00] <ErikHK> cdm10: thanks, it worked ;D
[01:01] <`eric-> cdm10, but it works? :)
[01:01] <saloxin> Kodemage: ;-). i'll stick with xen and it's pains
[01:01] <cdm10> ErikHK: sweet, no problem
[01:01] <cdm10> `eric-: if you have java
[01:01] <tigerplug292> seems to have worked! so far so good!
[01:01] <tigerplug292> thanks
[01:01] <stefg> jakamo, but it's too late anyway, so live with it, or reinstall feisty
[01:01] <cdm10> `eric-: there's also the firefox extension Chatzilla
[01:01] <cdm10> nick4: i dunno, do the command < aptitude show evolution >
[01:01] <sco50000> if there is anyone in here that knows how to set up wireless cards in feisty, please pm me
[01:01] <nick4> cdm10 thank you
[01:01] <usr> sorry thought you had to be root to get into sound prefs ,its been a long day
[01:01] <`eric-> cdm10, thanks
[01:01] <elad> oh
[01:02] <cdm10> usr: anything on Ubuntu that needs root should ask you for it, if you get to it from a menu.
[01:02] <elad> Could anyone please help me get sound working?
[01:02] <ZionPsyfer> sco50000, I've googled your card without success.  Unless someone has that card, I'm not sure how much help we can be.
[01:02] <Kodemage> saloxin: I'm not familiar with many VMs, just VMS and Parallell. Usually I just dual boot instead of take the performance hit.
[01:02] <Cryoniq> question: why have ati cards suddenly started working very bad and not at all with restricted? It worked good enough under feisty, but in gutsy not even the open source work anymore (and kernel tell something about failure with agpgart)?
[01:02] <usr> OK now that someone is ansering, we need help to spawn sound
[01:03] <elad> usr, who's answering?
[01:03] <elad> oh
[01:03] <elad> cdm10
[01:03] <XP1> how do i get wpa working?
[01:03] <cdm10> whaddaya mean, I'm answering?
[01:03] <cdm10> I don't know anything about sound.
[01:03] <elad> Well, he's answered a related question.
[01:03] <elad> But not what we need.
[01:03] <usr> wait one its scrolling fast
[01:03] <Neatchee> XP1: WPA should work automatically in Gutsy with NetworkManager
[01:03] <saloxin> Cryoniq: read the release notes
[01:03] <XP1> hmm
[01:04] <XP1> when i select the network, it only shows me WEP and LEAP
[01:04] <Neatchee> XP1: Where are you selecting the network from?  System -> Network, or the NetworkManager applet?
[01:04] <Cryoniq> saloxin, are those available on webpage somewhere?

[01:05] <Cryoniq> saloxin: thanks :)
[01:05] <earlmred> is there a program that will let me work with access databases in ubuntu?

[01:05] <jnc> ZionPsyfer: earlmred do you have a budget?
[01:05] <jnc> whoops
[01:05] <jnc> mischat...   earlmred do you have a budget?
[01:05] <earlmred> jnc, rather use free software, depends.
[01:05] <jnc> ZionPsyfer: I'm poking the server now, it's going to be a while before I know
[01:06] <Ahorner> erm.... whats command to mount
[01:06] <Rolenun> is the Intel x86 build usable with Intel 64-bit, or should I use AMD64? :)
[01:06] <usr> elad hope you get an answer, i'm bugging out!
[01:06] <Generic> anyone have awn running?
[01:06] <jnc> earlmred: the best practice way I know is to have an ODBC connector on a windows box doing the access stuff, then connect that to a normal server's database like PostgreSQL or MySQL
[01:06] <Neatchee> XP1: That means that NetworkManager is detecting the network as WEP incrypted, I believe.
[01:06] <Ahorner> whats command to mount?
[01:06] <XP1> but my network is WPA
[01:07] <earlmred> jnc, i guess i'll just have to fire up a virtual machine running office =\
[01:07] <XP1> :/
[01:07] <Neatchee> XP1: Try this for me...
[01:07] <Neatchee> XP1: Left click the network icon, and select "Connect to Other Wireless Network"
[01:07] <jnc> earlmred: yeah, I'm just sharing what I've heard actually works
[01:07] <XP1> ok
[01:07] <Neatchee> XP1: type the SSID of your network there, and select WPA from the dropdown
[01:07] <earlmred> jnc, does codeweavers support access?
[01:07] <jnc> I do small office / home office consulting for money
[01:07] <zzz> sco50000: According to the following address, your card is supported by Ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=610950
[01:08] <Neatchee> XP1: You want WPA Personal
[01:08] <jnc> earlmred: no idea.  I'll bet they'd answer your inquiry though, especially if you fork over some money to them when it works :)
[01:08] <XP1> ok
[01:08] <earlmred> something neat i noticed while using ie6 under wine ...
[01:08] <saloxin> earlmred: i think openoffice.org supports it natively. never done it though
[01:08] <zacchaeus> lsusb locks up when I look for a usb hard drive (hd stuck in an enclosure with ext3 fs from another ubuntu box that's broken) what do i do?
[01:08] <phreck> so. how do i get emerald themes in 7.10 heh.
[01:08] <earlmred> it DOES NOT render the same as ie6 under windows.
[01:08] <Neatchee> XP1: Enter your password and select the encryption type if you know it (AES-CCMP or TKIP) otherwise leave it on auto
[01:08] <thx1137> hal
[01:08] <jjs2> wow.  just upgraded to Gutsy and despite having an nvidia card, hibernate AND suspend WORK!  is this supposed to happen? ;-)
[01:09] <Neatchee> XP1: Did it connect?
[01:09] <Cryoniq> saloxin: hmm so that blank screen issue is related to the agpgart errors in kernel.log?
[01:09] <XP1> yup, thanks Neatchee
[01:09] <saloxin> Cryoniq: ati drivers are having issues. hope for better by the end of the month
[01:09] <jnc> zacchaeus: if dmesg is full of weird messages about disconnects, you may have a bad hub somewhere / low power situation, or there's a change incompatible with that machine's kernel + hardware

[01:09] <racarter> i am having problems with mounting ntfs drives...
[01:09] <Neatchee> XP1:  Alright, if it doesn't automatically connect when you log-in in the future, come on back and we'll try to work through getting it to properly detect the network as WPA
[01:09] <joshjosh> I can't get any USB devices to automount. Any idea what the problem is?
[01:10] <XP1> ok
[01:10] <jnc> shnastybiznastic: haven't tried it yet for my desktop, are your volume settings too high?  anything over 70% will clip on most sound chips
[01:10] <racarter> i just turned on my machine and couldn't access the ntfs file, then did this:

[01:10] <racarter> Mount is denied because NTFS is marked to be in use. Choose one action:
[01:10] <shnastybiznastic> jnc, even with my volume below 50% on both pcm and main it clips
[01:10] <Pirate_Hunter> can someone tell me how to fix this error (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41452/)?

[01:12] <fatcatmatt> how do i theme 7.10???
[01:12] <saloxin> Cryoniq: but yes - the nvidia is reportedly working
[01:13] <ZionPsyfer> Colro, sounds like FF is in safe mode
[01:13] <Neatchee> I have a BCM4318 wireless chipset.  When using the bcm43xx restricted drivers, iwconfig reports a massive number of (ever increasing) Rx Invalid Crypt.   When using ndiswrapper, iwconfig reports a constantly increasing stream of Tx Excessive Retry and Invalid Misc.  I've been unable to find any bug reports or documentation about this problem. On another, possibly related note, when my Wii is on, I receive periodic disconnects every
[01:13] <Neatchee> time the Wii and my router perform EAPOL negotiations.
[01:13] <Ahorner> echo?
[01:13] <Cryoniq> saloxin: yeah.. im trying another distro atm, ati card working very good in it, but im tied to kde then (and sure kde is nice with settings dialogues etc, but it feels so odd compared to gnome).
[01:13] <jnc> Gosha: never heard of it
[01:14] <Ahorner> how do i reinstall that thing uhh its the mbr manager in ubuntu..
[01:14] <Ahorner> i cant remember the name..
[01:14] <shnastybiznastic> jnc, huh, I installed alsaplayer, but it's not autocompleting orvisible in the menu
[01:14] <jnc> Gosha: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=556272  found with google
[01:14] <Colro> ZionPsyfer: Well, whenever a program stops responding it turns black and white until it is active again for some reason -- I thought it was a feature. For some reason Firefox didn't return to normal when it stopped locking up, though.
[01:14] <Neatchee> Cryoniq: I know what you mean.  KDE feels like a toy compared to gnome, I think.  Gnome feels crisp, and KDE feels...like...bubbles.
[01:14] <jnc> shnastybiznastic: "alsaplayer-gtk"
[01:14] <jnc> shnastybiznastic: I run it from commandline mostly
[01:14] <Ahorner> *sigh*
[01:14] <Colro> ZionPsyfer: I'm not worried about WHY it locked up -- I caused that by applying a new GTK theme while it had 20+ tabs open :)
[01:14] <Cryoniq> Neatchee: it is too much.. windows with it...
[01:15] <shnastybiznastic> jnc, the autocomplete or "alsa" only has "alsamixer" and "alsactl"

[01:22]  * Kinks ponders.
[01:22] <jnc> lol @ downgrading
[01:22] <mrunagi> *heh
[01:22] <fatcatmatt> kinks...cause there's too many kinks!!!
[01:22] <Neatchee> Ahorner:  You can always run "gksu -c aptitude dist-upgrade" later.  It won't hurt anything if you're fully upgraded :)
[01:22] <ebirtaid> hehe it is amusing to see all the people who were about to nut themselves about the new release coming back and complainging and talking about downgrading
[01:22] <jtu> gusty sure is nice. thanks guys!
[01:22] <mrunagi> kinks how do you do that
[01:22] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> itunes for linux or do i need to run itunes in wine or crossover office?
[01:22] <jnc> ebirtaid: did we tell them that downgrade is not possible?
[01:22] <jnc> we should.

[01:22] <Kinks> otherwise send a ctcp ACTION
[01:22] <Neatchee> Ahorner: once the upgrade is complete you'll want to try System -> Administration -> Screens and Graphics
[01:22] <ebirtaid> I'm sure they'll figure it out soon enough
[01:23]  * Kinks shrugs
[01:23] <ZionPsyfer> Unbutu[G33Z3R,  gtkpod works with most ipods
[01:23] <joanki> umi can't copy and paste it

=== seanieb65 is now known as seanieb6492
[01:24] <Neatchee> I have a BCM4318 wireless chipset.  When using the bcm43xx restricted drivers, iwconfig reports a massive number of (ever increasing) Rx Invalid Crypt.   When using ndiswrapper, iwconfig reports a constantly increasing stream of Tx Excessive Retry and Invalid Misc.  I've been unable to find any bug reports or documentation about this problem. On another, possibly related note, when my Wii is on, I receive periodic disconnects every
[01:24] <Neatchee> time the Wii and my router perform EAPOL negotiations.
[01:24] <jnc> jakamo: the reason is complicated, technical, and AFAIK no one completely understands what to do about it
=== seanieb6492 is now known as seanieb64

[01:40] <critt> After upgrade to 7.10 I cant move resize.or close any open windows. Any Ideas??
[01:40] <unilynx> astro76: Okie dokie. I never even thought of that. This is the first time I've used 64bit so...
[01:40] <cafuego> wirechief: Yes, we get it, stop pasting.
[01:40] <gnomefreak> hordag: you cant, use compiz
[01:40] <wirechief> ok fix it then.
[01:40] <stdin> !beryl | hordag
[01:40] <ubotu> hordag: Beryl has been merged with Compiz to form Compiz-Fusion.  New Beryl installs are discouraged. See also !compiz
[01:40] <zzz> wirechief: Can you remove the appropriate line in your /etc/apt/sources.list file and try upgrading then?
[01:40] <Rich4> I have a problem. any help for ubuntu features?
[01:40] <donny_baker> wirechief: patches welcome

[01:40] <gnomefreak> wirechief: its now called partner not commericial
[01:40] <ZionPsyfer> Sergo, That's not horrible.  A vista install at work took around 90 minutes.  It definitely depends on your hardware and how many packages you install.
[01:40] <Rich4> :(
[01:41] <tigerplug292> Gutsy in parallels anyone?
[01:41] <f0rgeIf`> I fixed it
[01:41] <mlalkaka> Is there an easy way to remove all non-default packages using synaptic or apt-get? In other words, I want to remove all packages that I have installed since installing ubuntu.
[01:41] <wirechief> yes but most people dont know about it
[01:41] <ubuntu_> yes

[01:41] <suse-lover> BTW, I have an error on the avant-docker as well... I installed the dev version coz that's what they recommend... and everything works corectly except that it appears offset by 1cm where it should be, it appears like 1cm above from the bottom screen,and when it should hide it doesn't, just half of it. It is as if it thinks the screen is bigger... any help please?
[01:41] <Ashfire908> how do i recreate a user's home folder and the basic files?
[01:41] <hordag> how do i get the cube????
[01:41] <ZionPsyfer> Sergo, No half hour install, which is nice.  But an hour isn't too too bad.  Have you tested the media as well?  cdrom might be having trouble as well.
[01:42] <mlalkaka> Ashfire908: what do you mean my recreate? did you delete the user account?
[01:42] <zzz> Ashfire908: Try copying everything under /etc/skel to the user's home directory. Don't forget to change the ownerships though!
[01:42] <Lifeisfunny> hordag, you have to install the compiz configuration manager
[01:42] <katharos> hey, is there a good way to troubleshoot graphics driver problems, like a log that will tell me where it breaks?
=== suse-lover is now known as luislo
[01:42] <hordag> i read that in new 7.10 berzl would be integrated?????
[01:42] <joanki> how come when i am installing g++ it requires me to enter my 7.10 installation cd?
[01:42] <astro76> unilynx, dunno
[01:42] <hordag> where do i find compiy manager??
[01:42] <Lifeisfunny> hordag, I think it's compiz that is integrated
[01:42] <Lifeisfunny> in synaptic
[01:42] <donny_baker> joanki: need to comment out your cdrom in sources.list
[01:42] <astro76> hordag, it's called compiz fusion now but yes
[01:42] <don-o> joanki: edit /etc/apt/sources.list to remove the cd repository
[01:42] <zzz> joanki: You can remove the line that corresponds to the CD in /etc/apt/sources.list

[01:43] <hordag> where do i find compiy fusion???
[01:43] <mlalkaka> katharos: /var/log/Xorg.0.log. Specifically, you could run the command `grep '(EE)' /var/log/Xorg.0.log` to display all errors
[01:43] <scguy318> hordag: in Gutsy, its bundled with it
[01:43] <katharos> mlalkaka: thanx, i'll try that
[01:43] <nrp> katharos, /var/log/Xorg.0.log will have X information, dmesg would have more driver related info

[01:43] <codesnik> hello. is it possible to download all needed packets for gutsy beforehand? my ISP is making something awful today, and i'm afraid my internet connection won't last for a two hours without a break
[01:43] <hordag> YEAH!
[01:43] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> gtkpod*
[01:44] <joanki> ok ok whatline is that?
[01:44] <don-o> codesnik: download and burn the .iso?
[01:44] <hordag> and where is it installed how do i start it_
[01:44] <joanki> that i am to delete
[01:44] <Lifeisfunny> hordag, look at system/preferences/appearance
[01:44] <lobo> eeek one upgrade to gutsy went fine, just did another box and I now see initramfs command prompt running BusyBox any ideas/links to sort this out
[01:44] <zzz> joanki: If I am not mistaken it's the first line.
[01:44] <scguy318> codesnik: you could download the alternative CD and perform a CD upgrade
[01:44] <katharos> nrp: i've looked through dmesg a bit, and didnt find anything helpful (at least that i could understand) but thanx
[01:44] <joanki> deb cdrom: ......
[01:44] <joanki> do i just delete it?
[01:44] <scguy318> hordag: its started automatically
[01:44] <joanki> the whole line?
[01:44] <scguy318> hordag: that is, if your system can handle it
[01:44] <mlalkaka> katharos: actually, a slightly better command is `grep '^(EE)' /var/log/Xorg.0.log` but either will do.
[01:44] <zzz> joanki: Yes.
[01:44] <Lifeisfunny> on the last tab is visuals .... that is where some of the tweaking takes place
[01:44] <donny_baker> joanki: no put a '#' in front of it
[01:44] <joanki> #?
[01:44] <Lifeisfunny> the other tweaking is done in the CCSM
[01:45] <joanki> zzz # sounds right to you?
[01:45] <zzz> joanki: donny_baker's suggestion is a better one.
[01:45] <joanki> sorry donny
[01:45] <joanki> ok
[01:45] <joanki> thanks
[01:45] <Sergo> ZionPsyfer: for example , i think, what the installation process must be more regid..
=== lobo is now known as lobo_nz

[01:45] <ebirtaid> hm does anyone know how to set dpi in gutsy?
[01:45] <hordag> WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO LOVE YALL DUDES IT WORKS LINUX POWERED 4EVER!
[01:45] <don-o> lol
[01:45] <joanki> ok thank you donny
[01:45] <ebirtaid> wow
[01:45] <Ashfire908> mlalkaka, i lost the entire /home folder, and i would like to recreate it.
[01:45] <donny_baker> joanki: np
[01:46] <mlalkaka> hordag: lol you must be a new gnu/linux user. welcome to the club!
[01:46] <Ashfire908> zzz, do i have to do anything to the files?
[01:46] <nrp> ebirtaid, system, preferences, appearance, fonts, details
[01:46] <ebirtaid> cool thanks
[01:46] <Sergo> ZionPsyfer: for example, if there is a small scrath on Cd, the installation can fail with red screen:) .. with windows xp, there can be a 1000 of scratch, but no problem with installing
[01:46] <Ahorner> Sergo: no joke
[01:46] <Sergo> and installation doesn't freeze
[01:46] <mlalkaka> Ashfire908: how did you lose it?
[01:46] <Lifeisfunny> ebirtaid, system/preferences/appearance/fonts
[01:46] <usser> through a hole in the pocket :)
[01:46] <Ahorner> i had 4 corrupted files for xp and it still worked lol
[01:46] <hordag> how can i manage the settings?
[01:46] <mlalkaka> Is there an easy way to remove all non-default packages using synaptic or apt-get? In other words, I want to remove all packages that I have installed since installing ubuntu.
[01:47] <zzz> Ashfire908: After you copy them, run "chown -R user:user /home/user" where user is the username whose home directory you are working on.
[01:47] <Falstius> mlalkaka: you could probably just reinstall more easily.
[01:47] <Ashfire908> mlalkaka, i *DID* have a hard drive failure in my server, but now it is somehow work!
[01:47] <Lifeisfunny> hordag, install the CCSM and it will let you tweak the settings
[01:47] <astro76> Sergo, your comparing CD-Rs with pressed CDs, that has nothing to do with windows or linux
[01:47] <ZionPsyfer> Sergo, see my experience is the opposite.  My XP cd is scratched and I have to use a specific cdrom drive to install it.  My dapper cd is more forgiving and is scratched worse.
[01:47] <hordag> whats that_
[01:47] <joanki> now that i've installed g++ how do i get gcc?
[01:48] <joanki> and gdb
[01:48] <nrp> joanki, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:48] <ubuntu_> bruce
[01:48] <Ahorner> for flash player am i supposed to download in rpm, tar.gz, or yum?
[01:48] <joanki> nrp i already did what you said with the word g++ at the end
[01:48] <joanki> is that the same thing?
[01:48] <donny_baker> i am having issues with configuring dhcp3-server... keeps telling me 'No subnet declaration for eth0 (172.16.254.254)'
[01:48] <KE6IGZ> !
[01:48] <donny_baker> configuration detail here: http://pastebin.ca/744026
[01:48] <Ashfire908> zzz, nm the drive is *somehow* working
[01:48] <donny_baker> it appears to have a subnet declaration any ideas?
[01:48] <zzz> Ashfire908: That's good!
[01:48] <CoasterMaster> Ahorner, are you trying to install in Firefox?
[01:48] <Lifeisfunny> hordag, open a terminal and run      sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[01:48] <mlalkaka> Falstius: I don't want to reinstall because I have used ubuntu a lot since installation and i don't want to lose my personal files (i'm using feisty not gutsy right now).
[01:48] <Necrosan> Xen is broken
[01:49] <Necrosan> it always crashes
[01:49] <nrp> joanki, if you installed build-essential, gcc and gdb are there
[01:49] <Necrosan> right when X is supposed to start
[01:49] <Necrosan> running amd64
[01:49] <Ashfire908> zzz, the server's array controller said it had failed, but it's working somewho
[01:49] <Ahorner> yeah
[01:49] <Ahorner> CoasterMaster: yeah
[01:49] <joanki> how do i make them run?
[01:49] <joanki> i typed g++ i typed gcc
[01:49] <zzz> Ashfire908: Time for backups, eh?
[01:49] <joanki> nothing happened
[01:49] <luislo> how do I uninstall and erase something I installed from source by sequeantially using make and make install?
[01:49] <CoasterMaster> Ahorner, you can just go to a website that uses Flash, and Firefox will automatically offer to install flash [note: this does not work with 64-bit systems]
[01:49] <Lifeisfunny> HOR system/preferences/appearance/ADVANCED DESKTOP EFFECTS SETTINGS
[01:49] <Sergo> astro76: i think that the installation will take more than 2 hours, is dangerous to wait so much time
[01:50] <Ahorner> CoasterMaster: oh yeah.
[01:50] <joshjosh> I'm having problems automounting anything USB in Gutsy. Any fixes?
[01:50] <Sergo> )
[01:50] <yaloki> luislo: "make uninstall" if you still have the sources, or pray
[01:50] <Sergo> the installation of an Os..
[01:50] <mlalkaka> luislo: most source packages have a target called 'uninstall'. so you could run `make uninstall`
[01:50] <Sergo> ok
[01:50] <tyler54> hello
[01:50] <luislo> yaloki: I have them, hehe, and I did make uninstall... but then, how do I erase everything?
[01:50] <Sergo> no more questions..
[01:50] <joanki> nrp: was that just a totally dumb question .... how do i get gcc to run?
[01:50] <astro76> Sergo, if you are having an issue, ask a question instead of insulting developers
[01:50] <nrp> joanki, are you sure you installed build-essential?
[01:50] <tyler54> hello
[01:50] <nrp> joanki, it's just 'gcc'
[01:50] <yaloki> luislo: how do you mean, "everything" ? make uninstall supposedly removes everything it installs with make install
[01:51] <joanki> i typed sudo apt-get install build-essential g++
[01:51] <tyler54> f u"s
[01:51] <joanki> when i type gcc, it says : gcc: no input files

[01:51] <luislo> see guys, I install a development version of something which works correct except that the graphics don't look quite nice, so I want to install the stable version... but when I do, it seems like all the previous configurations remain
[01:51] <nrp> joanki, hmm, well g++ would come with build-essential anyway
[01:51] <mlalkaka> luislo: if you are installing things from source, you might want to try a program called checkinstall. it installs programs from source and produces .deb package for them, making uninstallation easier.
[01:51] <Ashfire908> zzz: lol thanks for remining me! i would have forgotten (seriously)
[01:51] <luislo> so it 's not loeaded correctly
[01:51] <tyler54> hi
[01:51] <nrp> joanki, ok good, that means you have gcc, you just have to give it a file to compile
[01:51] <CoasterMaster> joanki, you have gcc installed
[01:51] <joanki> okkkkkk got it
[01:51] <joanki> this is dif than dev c++
[01:51] <CoasterMaster> gcc foo.c

[01:52] <Aqua> Hey guys, I just tried upgrading to Gutsy, and about three hours into the upgrade, my computer overheated, had a sudden kernel panic, and shut down.  Just about the worst possible time for that to happen.  The computer is upbootable.  Does anyone recommend a way to recover my files before I wipe everything and reinstall?  I tried burning a Ubuntu live CD, but the internal drive could not be mounted even from the live CD.

[01:56] <whonicca> ok i seriously need help with gusty, i want to use my own xorg.conf but everytime i put it in /etc/X11/ it gets overwritten
[01:56] <joanki> and once i gave myself a day i was like oh crappppppp i need another one i need to figure this stuff out!
[01:56] <whonicca> can this be stopped?
[01:56] <donny_baker> anybody know where I can go to get help on configuring dhcp3-server, my config looks ok (to me)?
[01:56] <katharos> mlalkaka:   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41458/
[01:56] <cafuego> whonicca: Yes. sudo chattr +i /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[01:57] <stemount> whonicca, thats due to the new xorg on the go
[01:57] <Sergo> it's six o'clock :o
[01:57] <saturdayplace> is it possible to format a drive as NTFS using the boot CD?
[01:57] <cafuego> whonicca: Note, that's a sledgehammer solution :-)
[01:57] <stemount> ^ yea saturdayplace
[01:57] <joanki> why not, saturday?
[01:57] <stemount> ? ^
[01:57] <whonicca> cafuego, lol whatever works
[01:57] <whonicca> =)
[01:57] <whonicca> thanks
[01:57] <cached> This might be a strange question
[01:57] <Cody> I installed gutsy and my wifi worked for a while, but doesn't seem to pass any data now.  It gets an IP, so it's processing the WEP correctly, but no pinging or anything fun like that.
[01:57] <Yuzzy> saturdayplace: Yes
[01:57] <joanki> hey i have a dumb question
[01:57] <cached> but is there any way to listen to the radio via ubuntu?
[01:57] <joanki> if i buy a brand new computer with no operating system, i can just install ubuntu?
[01:57] <h1st0> !ask > joanki
[01:57] <eugo> when using restricted manager, after clicking enable, then apply, it says "sources are missing"
[01:57] <joanki> and put it on?
[01:57] <CoasterMaster> saturdayplace, yes, the GNOME Partition Editor System -> Admistration -> Partition Editor will handle it
[01:57] <mlalkaka> katharos: can you also paste /etc/X11/xorg.conf in the pastebin please?
[01:57] <joanki> and save muchos bucks
[01:57] <cached> joanki: yep
[01:57] <LjL> joanki: why not?
[01:57] <donny_baker> joanki: yes, of course
[01:57] <Ahorner> second warning?
[01:57] <Arafangion> joanki: Of course.
[01:57] <Yuzzy> joanki: yes
[01:57] <h1st0> joanki: yeap
[01:57] <joanki> coooool
[01:57] <joanki> i love ubuntu now
[01:57] <joanki> i'm just always afraid i'm gonna screw it up
[01:57] <CoasterMaster> cached, yes, Rhythmbox [included] will play internet radio
[01:58] <Yuzzy> last try
[01:58] <h1st0> joanki: although you may not find someone who will sell a system with out an os
[01:58] <LjL> joanki... erm, it's an operating system, what did you expect?
[01:58] <Yuzzy> can't boot up from liveCD (ata2.00 exeption Emask... warining: cannot find root file system)
[01:58] <joanki> like i did four hours ago hehe and have to reformat
[01:58] <stemount> cached, you need a card for FM / DAB
[01:58] <satorious> how can i get 5.1 speakers working right?
[01:58] <Sergo> will have in future ubuntu the button start like in opensuse with recognized programs ?)
[01:58] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> Deluge FTW
[01:58] <donny_baker> joanki: you probably will at some point... but it's a learning experience :P
[01:58] <Pirate_Hunter> can someone help me identify why im using 376mb of memory?
[01:58] <cached> stemount: would i know if i have one? ;)
[01:58] <joanki> yea
[01:58] <h1st0> joanki: why did you reformat?  It can always be fixed.
[01:58] <joanki> but i dunno how to h1st0
[01:58] <astro76> Sergo, like the Applications menu in Ubuntu?
[01:58] <stemount> cached, would be extra £30-£40 or so ;)
[01:58] <joanki> and no one is here to make sure i do it right so i didnt wanna risk it
[01:58] <joanki> but i learned lesson #1
[01:58] <TorvusLinalds> anyone else have extremely slow typing in edit boxes with gutsy?
[01:58] <joanki> if you ask a question on here and it's a big one and someone gives you an answer,
[01:58] <stemount> Pirate_Hunter, are you on KDE?
[01:58] <h1st0> joanki: its just whether you want to learn how to fix it or not.  Thats what this room is for to ask next time you mess it up beyond repair.
[01:59] <joanki> don't take their word for it unless you know they know what they are doing
[01:59] <jze> hey.. does anyone have A-link WL54USB wlan dongle working on ubuntu ??
[01:59] <Ahorner> haha dongle
[01:59] <h1st0> joanki: yeap.  tips for you stay a way from automatix and envy.
[01:59] <jze> :P
[01:59] <scguy318> Pirate_Hunter: use the top command to see
[01:59] <joanki> hah
[01:59] <katharos> mlalkaka: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41459/
[01:59] <Sergo> astro76: :D
[01:59] <h1st0> joanki: and also you may want to create a seperate /home'
[01:59] <joanki> but ask zzz and intuitiveNipple
[01:59] <scguy318> jze: i dont have it, but you would most likely use ndiswrapper
[01:59] <joanki> those are my secdond words of advice hehe
[01:59] <threethirty> hi all
[01:59] <cached> stemount: and will i be able to listen to any radio station in this area?
[01:59] <joanki> i did h1st0... for files, right?
[01:59] <stemount> yep cached if you have the card
[01:59] <joanki> though i have no idea why home is dif from root
[01:59] <hikenboot> greetings...I am wondering if anyone can comment on a way to get debootstrap to work with fat32 boot partition?\
[01:59] <stemount> most are compatible with ubuntu
[01:59] <Pirate_Hunter> stemount: gnome which is weird max i would expect 216mb ram
[02:00] <irieKEN> Anyone here know what's going on with Fluxbuntu?
[02:00] <wirechief1> Aqua are you there ?
[02:00] <scguy318> !ndiswrapper | jze
[02:00] <ubotu> jze: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[02:00] <threethirty> is there a way to get the the desktop pager (using compiz-fusion) to work like it did with beryl
[02:00] <Pirate_Hunter> scguy318: sorry but which top command i cna see it
[02:00] <cached> stemount: why can't the Bluetooth/WiFi card read radio as well? ;)
[02:00] <stemount> I use GNOME and I usually stay under 200mb Pirate_Hunter
[02:00] <Ahorner> that'd be cool
[02:00] <stemount> cached, in a dream world :P
[02:00] <CoasterMaster> cached, Radio uses different frequencies than WiFi/Bluetooth
[02:00] <scguy318> jze: in Terminal, type top, then its basically a command-line process statter
[02:00] <stemount> in a dream worldd :P
[02:00] <jze> scguy318: well.. the thing is.. the usb dongle is working fine. The kernel has the module integrated in it (zd1211rw) but it just won't get the ip from the router
[02:00] <scguy318> Pirate_Hunter: in Terminal, type top, then its basically a command-line process statter
[02:00] <scguy318> jze: sry, addressed you incorrectly
[02:00] <jze> np
[02:00] <TorvusLinalds> i finally managed to get my fglrx working but now my ktorrent redraws really slowly (especially the column header widget) and typing in the search box of firefox is painfully slow, 1.5s per keypress... someone help!!!
[02:01] <Yuzzy> can't boot up from liveCD (ata2.00 exeption Emask... warining: cannot find root file system)
=== RB1234 is now known as RobotBanana
[02:01] <scguy318> jze: not sure, maybe something with DHCP
[02:01] <cached> Ok. more direct question: is there any way to listen to the ALCS in ubuntu?
[02:01] <scguy318> jze: could be something in the kernel module also, you could always use ndiswrapper if that fails
[02:01] <Ahorner> maybeh
[02:01] <stemount> ALCS? :(
[02:01] <Ahorner> lol
[02:01] <Ahorner> atracs
[02:01] <joanki> h1st0, if i create a separate home, how do i ensure all my files are going to home?
[02:01] <Ahorner> oh god, dont take me there
[02:01] <scguy318> Yuzzy: have you done integrity check on the CD?
[02:01] <Ahorner> damn you sony!
[02:01] <Sergo> astro76: will be in ubuntu, the recent lunched programs , like in other distros..
[02:01] <Sergo> ?
[02:01] <avarner> hi ubuntu! how's life?
[02:01] <joanki> or do i just make sure i save everything in home?
[02:02] <Necrosan> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=560720&highlight=Xen
[02:02] <Necrosan> my problem
[02:02] <Necrosan> anyone can help?
[02:02] <jze> scguy318: ok.. I might test that..
[02:02] <joanki> and if i save everything in home, does that mean if i screw up my system, i just have to install only root?
[02:02] <Yuzzy> scguy: memtest done
[02:02] <mlalkaka> katharos: what does the command `ls /dev/nvidia*` output anything?
[02:02] <scguy318> Yuzzy: not memtest, CD integrity test
[02:02] <ubuntu_> anybody using Gusty
[02:02] <stemount> I am :)
[02:02] <ubuntu_> do u have installed?
[02:02] <stemount> yes
[02:02] <avarner> ubuntu_: think most of us are
[02:02] <Yuzzy> scguy: Yes...
[02:02] <mlalkaka> katharos: also try `lsmod | grep nvidia`.
[02:02] <Wulong> I'am unable to remove this package. Someone got a suggestion? output http://pastebin.com/m43952cde
[02:02] <ubuntu_> do u have the compiz manager setup
[02:03] <Tarkus> anyone know why when i open a window it opens in the top left always?
[02:03] <scguy318> Yuzzy: perhaps you should check the MD5 of the ISO, and perhaps reburn
[02:03] <luislo> if one is banned from a channel... how long does it take to be reaccepted?
[02:03] <luislo> :D
[02:03] <katharos> mlalkaka: ls /dev/nvidia* resulted in: /dev/nvidia0  /dev/nvidiactl
[02:03] <CoasterMaster> luislo, depends on the channel and the infraction
[02:03] <TorvusLinalds> anyone?!?!?!  typing in my search box in firefox is *painfully* slow, something is wrong... also in ktorrent all the widgets are repainting incredibly slowly...  what is going on?
[02:03] <stemount> sudo dpkg --purge msttcorefonts?
[02:03] <Arafangion> luislo: It varies.
[02:03] <mlalkaka> katharos: ok that's good. what about the second command?
[02:03] <scguy318> sudo apt-get --purge msttcorefonts would be better
[02:03] <Aqua> Hey wirechief, are you getting my private messages?  I wonder if they're being blocked?
[02:03] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: what video card do you have?
[02:03] <Yuzzy> scguy: I swaped my 2 HD on this younger machine and since then XP wouldn't boot, Xubuntu wouldn't boot and even Live CD's like Ubuntu wouldn't boot
[02:03] <stemount>  ^ i do ubuntu_
[02:04] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, ati mobility radeon 9600
[02:04] <scguy318> Aqua: the receiver/sender needs to be authed with NickServ or have a user mode set in order to receive/send PMs
[02:04] <stemount> apt-get install ades?
[02:04] <astro76> Aqua, you have to register your nick
[02:04] <KI4IKL> Aqua, both users have to be registered and identified to send/recieve private messages
[02:04] <stemount> compiz manager
[02:04] <ubuntu_> i am running gutsy on live cd and I love how my monitor got setted up so quicky
[02:04] <Arafangion> Aqua: Check your messages from the server... If they're blocked, the server will tell you.
[02:04] <luislo> I swear I'm well behaved and all, but this guy he always answers my questions and pretty much everybody else's as if we were stupids... and I don't like that fact, so I comment on that and he banns me :S
[02:04] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: with restricted drivers?
[02:04] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, yes, latest version
[02:04] <scguy318> Yuzzy: is it the old /bin/sh tty job control issue? probably boot with all_generic_ide in that case, otherwise
[02:04] <Pirate_Hunter> scguy318: got that done that and yet i dont understand what im being shown? how do identify why my ram is that high?
[02:04] <luislo> what do you think about such kind of infraction, how long will I remain banned?
[02:04] <Necrosan> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=560720&highlight=Xen

[02:04] <stemount>  /msg nickserv set unfiltered on
[02:05] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: well i dont know... umm what window manager are you usingf
[02:05] <bqmassey> what's that do stemount
[02:05] <kkathman> damn it why does xchat lose itself when you detach the channel panes
[02:05] <scguy318> Pirate_Hunter: if theres a proces taking a significant amount of memory, it will be at the top of the listing, otherwise its the kernel buffering in memory
[02:05] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, metacity
[02:05] <Wulong> stemount: it doesn't help, it still wants to download the files.
[02:05] <Arafangion> luislo: Forever, until the computer you were using has long-decayed and the plastic turned into toxic dust. ;)
[02:05] <stemount> :(
[02:05] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: try kde see if it works better
[02:05] <Kaitlyn2004> In the package manager I wanted to install Amarok and then it wants to install a BUCNCH of things (i.e. KDE)... does Amarok not work w/ Gnome?
[02:05] <seanieb64> Hello everyone
[02:05] <stemount> apt-get remove -f msttcorefonts
[02:05] <scguy318> Pirate_Hunter: and that buffering doesn't harm performance, just simple caching that will be yielded to programs that need
[02:05] <seanieb64> Fixed my problem, foudn another.
[02:05] <stemount> Amarok works with GNOME Kaitlyn2004
[02:05] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: or fglrx
=== eric-- is now known as `eric-
[02:05] <scguy318> Kaitlyn2004: Amarok is a KDE app, therefore it needs the KDE libraries
[02:05] <h1st0> joanki: you create a seperate /home partition then you copy your current ~ there.  then you can tell it to mount that partition to /home.   That way if you ever reinstall you just tell the installer about your /home parition and it will keep you files and settings.
[02:05] <seanieb64> I cant get compiz to launch
[02:05] <Wulong> stemount: same also.
[02:05] <seanieb64> it complains that SGL isnt found
[02:06] <Tstnz> seri problemi con la nuova 7.10 e xgl ... veramente seri...
[02:06] <stemount> hmm :(
[02:06] <scguy318> Kaitlyn2004: its not gonna install the entirety of Kubuntu, but just the KDE stuff it needs
[02:06] <seanieb64> *XGL
[02:06] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, well...  i don't really want to but...  how do i change the window manager, do i have to log out
[02:06] <kevinp> I downloaded the 7.10 release, and when I try to boot the CD it eventually drops to a busybox shell prompt. Anyone else seen this and know what is going on?
[02:06] <Arafangion> joanki: I'd backup anyway, though.

[02:06] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: lol i cant remember
[02:06] <katharos> mlalkaka: and the second one is here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41460/
[02:06] <Ahorner> !kde
[02:06] <ubotu> KDE (http://kde.org) is the !desktop environment used natively in !Kubuntu. To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop », or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE . Latest KDE version is 3.5.8 for Gusty and Feisty, 3.5.6 for Edgy, and 3.5.5 for Dapper. See http://kubuntu.org for more information.
[02:06] <Kaitlyn2004> scguy318: is that a lot? Should I just use an alternative (what?)
[02:06] <scguy318> Kaityln2004: no
[02:06] <joanki> for peopk
[02:06] <Arafangion> Wow, this channel is extremely busy.
[02:06] <joanki> i have no idea what that meant hist
[02:06] <scguy318> Kaityln2004: the latter question if you want to
[02:06] <stemount> Wulong, do apt-get install msttcorefonts
[02:06] <joanki> but ummm... i think you said that i create my home, which i have
[02:06] <TorvusLinalds> so infuriating
[02:06] <stemount> then apt-get remove msttcorefonts :P
[02:06] <joanki> and i dunno what ~ means
[02:06] <luislo> Arafangion, haha... funny, but seriously, this guy I'd like to meet him on the street
[02:06] <scguy318> Kaityln2004: the KDE libs aren't serious overhead
[02:06] <Kaitlyn2004> scguy318: so what are my options?
[02:06] <seanieb64> Can anyone help me with my XGL prob?
[02:07] <Arafangion> luislo: Not my problem.
[02:07] <TorvusLinalds> should never have installed gutsy... buggy piece of c##p
[02:07] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: actually, use gnome
[02:07] <Wulong> stemount: it doesnt work, it halts in the install. It never gets more than 4% of the file.
[02:07] <joanki> but do i want to make sure to save all my files to home?
[02:07] <scguy318> Kaityln2004: you can use Amarok, or you can use other media players like mplayer, VLC, Rhythmbox, if you wish
[02:07] <stemount> hmm :/
[02:07] <Neatchee> Hey all, I'm getting a bothersome amount of "Tx Excessive Retries" and "Misc Invalid" reported by iwconfig.  Is this something I need to worry about?
[02:07] <stemount> apt-get update
[02:07] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, i am using gnome
[02:07] <h1st0> joanki: nah  you don't quite understand .  Let me give you a link.  Keep in mind this isn't something you need to do.  Its just an opinion of a differrent way to set up your system.
[02:07] <stemount> apt-get upgrade?
[02:07] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: i knew that...
[02:07] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: lol...
[02:07] <joanki> ok
[02:07] <mlalkaka> katharos: wow just as an aside, we have surprisingly similar hardware: nvidia geforce fx 5200 and a sis 96x chipset.
[02:07] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, then what are you saying
[02:07] <JerseyMonkey> Question: I'm having issues with the '-f' feature of rdesktop, could someone help me with it?
[02:07] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: use kde, to swtich...
[02:07] <Tstnz> sorry
[02:07] <Arafangion> joanki: As a user, all your files are stored to your home directory, as ~/, which is a link to /home/joanki.
[02:08] <katharos> mlalkaka: and yours works fine? so not fair! :P
[02:08] <mlalkaka> katharos: does the graphical interface start up at all?
[02:08] <Wulong> stemount: same thing happens with apt-get upgrade, it tries to install the package.
[02:08] <h1st0> joanki: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
[02:08] <Arafangion> joanki: It is similar to C:\Documents and Settings\joanki, except that you don't have permission to save your files anywhere else at all, unlike windows.
[02:08] <joanki> got it
[02:08] <joanki> ohhh i see
[02:08] <`eric-> should i format the drive in the livecd before i do the clean install?
[02:08] <Ahorner> go to
[02:08] <stemount> Wulong, have you added different sources?
[02:08] <`eric-> would that make it easier?
[02:08] <Wiseguy> hey guys, for some reason whenever i play a long playlist of video, like multiple files in a playlist, from any media player (xine, totem, mplayer) to my tv-out, after a few hours the audio and video desync... does anyone know what causes this?
[02:08] <CoasterMaster> eric-, the installer will format for you
[02:08] <joanki> i think it does it for you, doesn't it?
[02:08] <stemount> extra repositories
[02:08] <joanki> eric?
[02:08] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: system> administration> screen and graphcs
[02:08] <Arafangion> joanki: Though, if you use a database, or some other programs, then you might have data in /var
[02:08] <`eric-> ok thanks
[02:08] <joanki> wooo i knew an answer haha
[02:08] <Wulong> stemount: no, it's a real source.
[02:08] <katharos> mlalkaka: i get the bulletproof X system, then it starts up in failsafe mode and i have a seriously dodgy resolution but it works
[02:08] <joanki> got it arafangion
[02:08] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: then the graphics card tab
[02:08] <scguy318> Kaitlyn2004: does that answer your question? anything else you need?
[02:08] <joanki> except i've got my other partition, my c drive
[02:09] <joanki> which i can save things to, too
[02:09] <stemount> do
[02:09] <Neatchee> Also, can anyone think of a reason why EAPOL negotiation between my Wii and my router would cause my ubuntu laptop to lose its connectivity to the internet for about 30 seconds?
[02:09] <Arafangion> joanki: You can also write to /tmp, but that is by definition TeMPorary data. :)
[02:09] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: argh i dont think this is it
[02:09] <joanki> that's why 7.10 is good
[02:09] <Berzerker> I'm trying to install pidgin, on gutsy, but MSN fails to enable, saying I need SSL
[02:09] <stemount> apt-get -q install msttcorefonts
[02:09] <seanieb64> Anyone here know why I installed it, but Compiz doesnt see XGL?
[02:09] <joanki> it automaticaly gives you that thingie you need to do it
[02:09] <kevinp> I downloaded the 7.10 release, and when I try to boot the CD it eventually drops to a busybox shell prompt. Anyone else seen this and know what is going on?
[02:09] <h1st0> Neatchee: maybe if you only have so many dhcp leases availible?
[02:09] <epidodi> I just entered some commands from a feisty wiki in gutsy (hoping it would work). . .
[02:09] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: i dont know lol
[02:09] <TorvusLinalds> ahorner, i dont even have 'screen and graphics'
[02:09] <scguy318> Berzerker: weird, you might need to install the SSL packages, gnutls or something
[02:09] <katharos> mlalkaka: it also starts up fine if i set it to use the nv drivers instead of nvidia
[02:09] <whonicca> cafuego, how do i reverse chattr +i
[02:09] <Berzerker> I tried to
[02:09] <joanki> although why anyone would want to use windows is my guess ;)
[02:09] <stemount> Neatchee, is the laptop a static ip?
[02:09] <epidodi> it did not - can someone tell me if I borked something by looking at the commands?
[02:09] <Berzerker> but the requirements both say no installation candidate
[02:09] <joanki> i've become a linux snob.... one that doesn't know how to use linux heh
[02:09] <Arafangion> joanki: Once you've learnt how to use gcc, I suggest you consider using an IDE, because you seem to like IDE's.
[02:10] <Neatchee> stemount: no, but it does have a reserved IP on the router, based on its MAC address
[02:10] <JerseyMonkey> Question: Is there a 'explorer' I can use for Ubuntu beyond 'Ubuntu-desktop'? I dislike all the apps Ubuntu-desktop forces you to install.
[02:10] <joanki> i want to learn, arafangion
[02:10] <Wulong> stemount: bah, still the same. It wants to download whatever I do.
[02:10] <Arafangion> joanki: kdevelop is one such IDE.
[02:10] <Ahorner> TorvusLinalds: what version are you running
[02:10] <joanki> if im gonna be a programmer, i think i gotta learn
[02:10] <TorvusLinalds> i'll tell you why people use windows, cos it bloody WORKS unlike this gutsy rubbish which has almost bricked my computer
[02:10] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: like file manager?
[02:10] <stemount> are you sure there are no IP conflicts?
[02:10] <Neatchee> h1st0: No, i have plenty of leases available :)
[02:10] <Arafangion> joanki: Yeah, you do.
[02:10] <robert232323> i need help!! i installed chipset and netgear drivers for my wireless usb, but when i plug it in it freezes my computer..what do i do?
[02:10] <Berzerker> you can't really brick a computer
[02:10] <Berzerker> lol
[02:10] <joanki> wow torvus, really?
[02:10] <stemount> what was the outcome of that command Wulong though
[02:10] <Arafangion> joanki: Please use my nick when you talk to me.
[02:10] <h1st0> Neatchee: hrm... thats just wierd.
[02:10] <epidodi> gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_9 "<Control><Alt>Delete"
[02:10] <joanki> Arafangion: like that?
[02:11] <Arafangion> joanki: That's it. :)
[02:11] <whonicca> how do i reverse chattr +i
[02:11] <joanki> Arafangion: does that make your name go red?
[02:11] <Ashfire908> is there a signal i can send to fsck.ext3 to *SAFELY* end a bad block test?
[02:11] <Neatchee> stemount: any ideas?
[02:11] <epidodi> gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands/command_9 "gnome-system-monitor"
[02:11] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: explorer like file manager?
[02:11] <Wulong> stemount: ip conflicts?
[02:11] <TorvusLinalds> well it's almost bricked, i mean it's about that useful
[02:11] <Arafangion> joanki: Yellow, actually. :)
[02:11] <joanki> haha
[02:11] <joanki> yellow. k.
[02:11] <stemount> Wulong, that was for Neatchee :P
[02:11] <Berzerker> And windows much ber.tte
[02:11] <Berzerker> better*
[02:11] <Berzerker> Right
[02:11] <epidodi> I entered those commands to change control alt delete to open the gnome-system-monitor
[02:11] <joanki> Arafangion: boy your name is a lot of work go type, even if i hit up arrow
[02:11] <epidodi> it worked in feisty
[02:11] <stemount> Neatchee, was brand is the router?
[02:11] <epidodi> it didn't work in gutsy
[02:11] <Arafangion> joanki: Type in 'ara'<tab>
[02:11] <Neatchee> stemount: D-Link WBR-2310
[02:11] <mlalkaka> katharos: are you in the grapical interface right now or are you in one of the pseudo-terminals (by pressing ctrl+alt+F1, for example)
[02:11] <epidodi> did I hurt something by typing those in gutsy?
[02:11] <joanki> Arafangion, cooll.... is your name yellow now?  cuz it is a , not  a :
[02:12] <stemount> Neatchee, they aren't known for being stable
[02:12] <stemount> have you upgraded the firmware?
[02:12] <Sulo_Seppa> Can I upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10 without the install disk? (apt or such)
[02:12] <Arafangion> joanki: Yup. :) It highlights if the name exists anywhere in the line.
[02:12] <Neatchee> stemount: are you a registered user on FreeNode? If so, PMs :)
[02:12] <stemount> apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:12] <Arafangion> joanki: You must be using xchat.
[02:12] <joanki> got it ty
[02:12] <katharos> mlalkaka: i'm in the failsafe mode with dodgy res.
[02:12] <Sulo_Seppa> thanks
[02:12] <Ashfire908> Sulo_Seppa, update manager
[02:12] <epidodi> any ubuntu help channels on this server?
[02:12] <Neatchee> stemount: yes, the firmware is up to date
[02:12] <scguy318> epidodi: you're right here
[02:12] <joanki> Arafangion, yes, is xchat good i was gonna trry irssi
[02:12] <katharos> mlalkaka: but yeah, graphical interface
[02:12] <JerseyMonkey> scguy318: I removed a bunch of apps like Evolution, Xine, and a few others because I disliked the overwhelming amount of apps. When I removed 'tsclient' (terminal services client) Ubuntu-desktop got uninstalled. When I tried to go to 'Home Folder' or 'Computer' it never loads, most likely because Ubuntu-desktop is missing. I tried ot reinstall 'ubuntu-desktop' but it wants me to reinstall all the apps I just removed.
[02:12] <stemount> nah. if you go to #stemount though :P
[02:12] <Kaitlyn2004> I go to Places -> Network then navigate to somewhere on my windows computer, right click on an mp3 and "open with other application"... and VLC and XMMS both wouldn't play the file.. any ideas?
[02:12] <profanephobia> epidodi, #ubuntu
[02:12] <Arafangion> joanki: I'm an irssi guy, it's great in conjunction with screen. :)
[02:12] <Berzerker> lol
[02:12] <Ashfire908> epidodi, guess where you are
[02:13] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that yields a Ubuntu desktop
[02:13] <Berzerker> so does anyone know the problem?
[02:13] <joanki> Arafangion, so you use it in terminal?
[02:13] <epidodi> gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_9 "<Control><Alt>Delete"
[02:13] <epidodi> gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_9 "<Control><Alt>Delete"
[02:13] <profanephobia> this whole time i thought i was in off-topic lol
[02:13] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: perhaps you removed nautilus somehow
[02:13] <Arafangion> joanki: I run it on the server, and I just detach when I logout, and re-attach (ie, screen -rd) when I login. :) Yeah, in terminal.
[02:13] <epidodi> That worked in feisty - but not gutsy
[02:13] <kevinp> wirechief1: i did check the the checksum after download. The media will not check itself. It drops to a shell prompt.
[02:13] <epidodi> did I hurt something in gutsy by entering those?
[02:13] <mlalkaka> katharos: what happens if you start the program `glxgears`? what framerates are outputted in the console after while running the program?
[02:13] <joanki> Arafangion, isn't that horribly unuserfriendly?
[02:13] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: ubuntu-desktop is NOT required at all, it just simply depends on the stuff that the Ubuntu devs consider should be in a Ubuntu desktop
[02:13] <JerseyMonkey> scguy318: What package do I need to add to bring back the functioning of my 'explorer'.
[02:13] <kevinp> wirechief1: forgot to mention, the checksum did match.
[02:13] <Arafangion> joanki: No...  What do you mean by "user friendly"?
[02:13] <joanki> Arafangion, i tried to use it but it was so boring looking
[02:14] <Ashfire908> what signal do i send to fsck.ext3 to safely stop a bad block test?
[02:14] <joanki> Arafangion, not to mention it was such hard work to make anything WORK
[02:14] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: probably something like Nautilus, moment
[02:14] <katharos> mlalkaka: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0". Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
[02:14] <Arafangion> joanki: If the network dies, or I want to go somewhere else, I just go there, and log into my server, and my entire screen session continues to operate without even knowing about it.
[02:14] <katharos> mlalkaka: it worked fine when i was using nv
[02:14] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: why the nautilus package :P
[02:14] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: im betting thats probably it
[02:14] <joanki> oh
[02:14] <Arafangion> joanki: Linux is simply *different* to windows.
[02:14] <epidodi> the purpose of the commands was to redirect control alt delete to open gnome-system-tools
=== krazykat is now known as mapez
[02:15] <joanki> Arafangion, but you gotta be brainier to use linux and esp irssi
[02:15] <joanki> Arafangion, are you a programmer?
[02:15] <Arafangion> joanki: Nah, I disagree. Just gotta learn how to read documentation, such as 'man irssi'.
[02:15] <JerseyMonkey> scguy318: Package manager says Nautilus is installed, I am reinstalling it.
[02:15] <Arafangion> joanki: I'm a software engineer.
[02:15] <xp_prg3> if I have music coming out of my headphones, can I record this somehow into a wav file somehow easily in linux?
[02:15] <mlalkaka> katharos: i'm sure it did but it probably didn't have a very good framerate. the nv driver doesn't have 3d graphics acceleration support, so although its very stable, its no good for running fancy desktop effects and games. that's what the nvidia driver is for.
[02:15] <Arafangion> joanki: Why don't you learn how to program in Python before learning C?
[02:15] <Ashfire908> how do i send a text signal to a program?
[02:15] <joanki> Arafangion, cuz i gotta do it for class
[02:15] <Vlet> joanki: I use screen too - it's incredibly easy, and once you learn a few commands, things are so much easier than mashing your mouse everywhere
[02:15] <JerseyMonkey> scguy318: And now it works. Thankyou.
[02:15] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: weird, what packages did you remove anyway? perhaps something in there
[02:15] <bruenig> c > python
[02:16] <scguy318> JerseyMonkey: np
[02:16] <Arafangion> joanki: Ahh, very well.
[02:16] <Arafangion> bruenig: Shuddup!
[02:16] <joanki> what does it mean you use screen
[02:16] <skt> Hey uh.
[02:16] <epidodi> does anyone know?
[02:16] <bqmassey> what do you folks recommend for P2P in ubuntu?
[02:16] <katharos> mlalkaka: that's right, which is why i've been working so long on getting the nvidia drivers working :)
[02:16] <skt> So how do I go about
[02:16] <stemount> Limewire?
[02:16] <scguy318> !p2p
[02:16] <ubotu> Conventional P2P clients: Limewire/GTK-Gnutella/Frostwire (Gnutella Network).  -  BitTorrent: see !torrent  -  Direct connect: try valknut.  -  Also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P2PFileSharing for general information.
[02:16] <stemount> bittorrent?
[02:16] <Arafangion> joanki: Well, install screen.
[02:16] <skt> Getting all the media codec thingies
[02:16] <joanki> oh i see
[02:16] <skt> !media | skt
[02:16] <Vlet> joanki: oh, I assumed Arafangion was talking about screen earlier
[02:16] <bqmassey> scguy318, ubotu:  DAMN YOU UBOTU. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.
[02:16] <stemount> I use screen!
[02:16] <stemount> i feel great :(
[02:16] <skt> !codec | skt
[02:16] <mlalkaka> katharos: did you edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file yourself? how did you install the nvidia driver? it seems that there is a section missing from the xorg.conf file.
[02:16] <Necrosan> two girls, one cup
[02:16] <epidodi> sigh
[02:17] <Arafangion> joanki: Then load up two terminals, let's pretend that the second terminal is another machine, ssh'ed into your machine.
[02:17] <scguy318> bqmassey: ubotu is a bot ;)
[02:17] <joanki> Arafangion, a softwrae engineer IS a programmer, no?
[02:17] <JerseyMonkey> scguy318: Just found a file on my machine called nautilus-debug-log.txt, and it has about 1000 lines of 'error due to signal 11'. Anyways, thankyou for the help.
[02:17] <scguy318> joanki: not rly
[02:17] <stemount> ubuntu apt
[02:17] <bqmassey> scguy318: yea i know
[02:17] <Ashfire908> how do i send a signal
[02:17] <Arafangion> joanki: Run screen on one, type something, fire up your favorite console text editor, irssi, or whatever.
[02:17] <stemount> what does Ubotu listen for :P
[02:17] <scguy318> Ashfire908: kill -signalid processid
[02:17] <joanki> ok
[02:17] <Arafangion> joanki: Then on the second terminal, type in 'screen -rd'.
[02:17] <joanki> what is the purpose for that ara
[02:17] <Aquaeolian> Hey guys, my computer overheated and had a kernel panic about three hours into the Gutsy upgrade.  I just burned a live CD to try to recover my files, but the internal hard drive could not be mounted.  Any ideas on what I should do?
[02:17] <katharos> mlalkaka: I installed the driver using the restricted repository manager, and when it didnt work i edited the file using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:18] <bruenig> joanki, just a term they use to make themselves feel more important
[02:18] <Ashfire908> scguy318: can i put a text signal into that?
[02:18] <Arafangion> joanki: Ever used VNC?
[02:18] <stemount> Aquaeolian, put it in another comp?
[02:18] <joanki> Arafangion, no what is that
[02:18] <briantumor> hi, does anyone have the inittab file for kubuntu feisty??
[02:18] <Berzerker> I'm trying to use MSN on pidgin, but I can't because it says I need a supported SSL library
[02:18] <Aquaeolian> I only have this one computer.  It doesn't mount at all...
[02:18] <briantumor> when i did a synaptic upgrade.. the inittab file got deleted
[02:18] <scguy318> Ashfire908: text signal?
[02:18] <Arafangion> joanki: Ever had a need to do stuff on your PC, then go out to the balcony with your laptop and just continue working without setting up yoru environment again?
[02:18] <Dagon> Any ideas on how to get an IPOD or flash card mounted
[02:18] <briantumor> can someone send me theirs?
[02:19] <joanki> no ..... am i supposed to have experienced that
[02:19] <briantumor> hey!
[02:19] <stemount> Dagon, it just works straight away?
[02:19] <bruenig> Dagon, mount it like any other usb drive
[02:19] <eugo> i'm upgrading firefox, but where should i put it? /usr/lib or /usr/share?
[02:19] <Ashfire908> scguy318: like SIGUSR1
[02:19] <scguy318> Berzerker: you might need to install the gnutls package
[02:19] <bruenig> eugo, /opt
[02:19] <Dagon> get all sort of error messages
[02:19] <mlalkaka> katharos: what is the output of `dmesg | grep -i nvidia`?
[02:19] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> gtkpod for ipod
[02:19] <scguy318> Ashfire908: then kill -USR1 pid
[02:19] <Arafangion> joanki: Ever heard of "remote desktop" or heck, calling someone to instruct them on how to do specific steps on their computer because you're not physically there?
[02:19] <Berzerker> what package is that
[02:19] <joanki> yes
[02:19] <sco50000> the ubuntu 7.04 updates are going reallly sloooow
[02:20] <joanki> i have
[02:20] <scguy318> Berzerker: gnutls

[02:20] <joanki> oh WOW
[02:20] <sco50000> 16kB/second
[02:20] <eugo> why /opt? it is already installed, it should be sufficient to overwrite the old version
[02:20] <joanki> Arafangion,
[02:20] <Vlet> joanki: I use screen as follows. I ssh into my server, and run screen. I then log into irc using my irc client, 'irssi', then after a while, I just close my ssh terminal. then later when I want to come back, I ssh into my server again, type 'screen -r', and I'm back to irc without having to re-connect to the irc server, etc
[02:20] <joanki> oops
[02:20] <bqmassey> QUESTION:  BitTorrent doesn't show up in my Applications menu.. how do i put it there
[02:20] <scguy318> Berzerker: sry wrong name
[02:20] <joanki> Arafangion, so wait... that is very cool
[02:20] <Berzerker> ll
[02:20] <Berzerker> lol
[02:20] <sco50000> and there are 125 updates: 192MB in total
[02:20] <joanki> Arafangion, i see what you are saying but how is it possible??
[02:20] <Arafangion> joanki: 'screen' is considered a linux "killer app", incidentially.
[02:20] <Aquaeolian> I should clarify: the hardware itself is okay.  The computer shut down in the middle of an upgrade, though, and I can't boot up because the software is not in a usable state.  I think my files should still be there, if I can only get to them.  My hard drive isn't mountable even in a Live CD...  I need some ideas for how to get my data before I reinstall the operating system.
[02:20] <scguy318> Berzerker: its libgnutls13
[02:20] <luislo> Ok, so usually when you uninstall something the configurations are still kept in a folder starting with a dot... specifically for AWN, where is this folder?
[02:20] <stemount> bqmassey, system -> prefs -> main menu -> Internet -> Tick bittorrent
[02:20] <stemount> :)
[02:20] <Berzerker> already newest version
[02:20] <joanki> if i follow the instructions you just said, should i be able to do this?
[02:20] <joanki> Arafangion,
[02:20] <joanki> sorry
[02:21] <Arafangion> joanki: Yes...
[02:21] <JerseyMonkey> Question: When I use 'rdesktop' on command line and use the '-f' condition, I am unable to use CTR+ALT+ENTER to exit full screen.
[02:21] <Ashfire908> scguy318: would you happen to know the safeest signal to give to tell a process to end?
[02:21] <scguy318> Berzerker: weird, try reinstalling it? or Pidgin
[02:21] <Vlet> bqmassey: If you load up your 'main menu' control panel, you can activate it in the internet menu

[02:21] <scguy318> Ashfire908: a simple kill pid, that would be SIGINT, may be it
[02:21] <bruenig> eugo, firefox does not follow the fhs, it therefore should be put in /opt, ubuntu for some reason tries to hack it up until it kind of fits into fhs but it still doesn't. So getting all the files in the right place to overwrite is tiresome and tedious. Just put it in /opt and launch it from there, much simpler.
[02:21] <stemount> is the way forward :P
[02:21] <scguy318> Ashfire908: it really depends on the process and what you want to do
[02:21] <Berzerker> I've try to install it with aptitude
[02:21] <Berzerker> apt-get remove pidgin
[02:21] <joanki> i dunno if i could do it
[02:21] <Berzerker> then apt-get install pidgin, but that didn't work
[02:21] <scguy318> Berzerker: dont you need sudo?
[02:21] <kevinO> if i get ubuntu-desktop and install it on ubuntun server, would I get the same packages that come with the full release?
[02:21] <bqmassey> Vlet: perfect. thanks.
[02:22] <joanki> Arafangion, oops i keep forgetting your name.... but wow i am not sure i could do that... is it REALLY that easy?
[02:22] <scguy318> Berzerker: sudo apt-get ... if you're not already doing that
[02:22] <stemount> yea kevinO
[02:22] <noam_> how can i shut down my PC speaker?
[02:22] <kevinO> ok thanks
[02:22] <Berzerker> well, the command itself worked, but the error still appeared
[02:22] <Berzerker> is what I meant
[02:22] <scguy318> Berzerker: pastebin the error please
[02:22] <scguy318> !pastebin | Berzerker
[02:22] <ubotu> Berzerker: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[02:22] <Arafangion> joanki: Yes.  Many things are quite easy on Linux... It's just very different to windows.
[02:22] <scguy318> Berzerker: and I'm sorry but I must brb
[02:22] <stemount> dpkg --purge pidgin
[02:22] <stemount> apt-get install pidgin
[02:22] <Ashfire908> scguy318 make fsck.ext3 safefuly stop a read-write bad block test
[02:22] <joanki> how do i ssh it?
[02:22] <Arafangion> joanki: Many people try to use linux assuming that it is somewhat similar to windows, and thus find it extremely difficult.
[02:22] <joanki> sorry you can stop explaining things whenever you want
[02:22] <runelind> when you mount smb shares through the "connect to server" option, do they physically get mounted to a directory?
[02:22] <Vlet> bqmassey: although many prefer to use a torrent app called 'Deluge' which can be found through synaptic
[02:23] <Arafangion> joanki: ssh username@computername, the computer must be running sshd.
[02:23] <stemount> runelind, yes
[02:23] <runelind> stemount: which?
[02:23] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> I preffer deluge to Bittorrent
[02:23] <bqmassey> Vlet: which do you prefer?
[02:23] <runelind> I thought it'd be something like /media/foo
[02:23] <Ahorner> lol /pity/foo
[02:23] <bruenig> deluge is awful buggy still but it functions decently
[02:23] <Vlet> bqmassey: Deluge :)
[02:23] <Berzerker> stemount: same error
[02:23] <nahoo> hola
[02:23] <Arafangion> joanki: Also, many people mistake "user friendly" with "Is the same as what I used before".
[02:23] <Vlet> bqmassey: it's a lot like uTorrent
[02:23] <Ashfire908> scguy318, no clue?
[02:23] <nahoo> ayuda, por favor
[02:23] <bqmassey> Vlet: oh awesome... that's what i prefer
[02:24] <gcw> nahoo: en que podemos servirle?
[02:24] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> Deluge FTW

[02:24] <JerseyMonkey> Question: When I use 'rdesktop' on command line and use the '-f' condition, I am unable to use CTR+ALT+ENTER to exit full screen.
[02:24] <joanki> that's true
[02:24] <bqmassey> Vlet: uTorrent...    i just want to use whichever has the most social and productive (both up and down) behaviour
[02:24] <bqmassey> Vlet: the most efficient

It is the same as your original xorg.conf file with the added "Modules" section which i copied from my xorg.conf file. back up your current xorg.conf file, add the Modules section from the one i pasted, then restart X.

[02:30] <LjL> kevinO: can you pastebin the whole console input/output of that?
[02:30] <aotianlong> why the gvim work incorrect.
[02:30] <Arafangion> kevinO: Hint; Take a look at the fourth charactor.
[02:30] <Vlet> kevinO: maybe telling us when it happened, what package it said was missing, what you were doing when it happened
[02:30] <JerseyMonkey> Arafangion: I used 'man rdesktop' and couldnt' see any change. I used it perfectly well in Ubuntu 7.04 and Xubuntu 7.04, but in 7.10 all my machines have this issue with -f.

[02:31] <gvsa123> stemount: enabled that already also
[02:31] <Arafangion> kevinO: The best response is to say "Opps, that was a typo", so that it's acknowledged.
[02:31] <TorvusLinalds> there's something... just... very wrong with my graphics drivers or something... no idea what... but lots of things take ages to repaint...  help

[02:32] <youknowm1> yeah, but it they worked on 7.04
[02:32] <attunix> dwxreaper: you have to define the directory
[02:32] <Ahorner> youknowm1: where did you download them from
[02:32] <KuJaX> Ahorner:  So that is the only stipulation, is that they send you an e-mail every month?  Do you have a link on their site where they talk about that?.

[02:32] <Kaitlyn2004> if I "make uninstall"... what do I do after that? anything?
[02:32] <Arafangion> JerseyMonkey: Did 7.04 have a different version of rdesktop?

[02:33] <user_> hi all, after upgrading to gutsy my laptop takes half minute to start any application. Any idea what's happening?
[02:33] <Arafangion> JerseyMonkey: Maybe there's a bug with the one on 7.10?  Try compiling your own version and checking it out?
[02:33] <JerseyMonkey> Arafangion: I presume it was probably an earlier version, but I dont' see how '-f' could get broken by that.
[02:33] <aotianlong> bye every one!
[02:33] <TorvusLinalds> this is just ridiculous... how can it be so broken from feisty to gutsy....  unbelievable mess, loads of stuff doesn't work properly any more.  what a train wreck
[02:33] <JerseyMonkey> Arafangion: I tested it on two different machines, adn even reinstalled the rdestkop package.
[02:33] <kst> gn.
[02:33] <youknowm1> Ahorner, idk they were just in my library for a long time and I used to listen to them on 7.04 but now 7.10 tells me that they are encrypted and cannot be played
[02:33] <Kaitlyn2004> anybody..?? if I "make uninstall"... what do I do after that? anything?
[02:33] <Arafangion> JerseyMonkey: re-installation of the same version could never make a difference.

[02:41] <alecwh> How do I get rid of unused dependencies with apt-get?
[02:41] <Vlet> epidodi: the forums
[02:41] <Tom47> if i use gksudo nautilus and delete files do they go to a trash bin?
[02:41] <Pici> alecwh: apt-get autoremove

[02:41] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> ive given up trying to  run compiz  with my Ati xpress 200 graphics card it freezes up  so i think  ill leave it alone #
[02:41] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, and ktorrent repaints really slow, and my image viewer.... all repainting really slowly
[02:41] <Vlet> epidodi: but your answer is in that man page somewhere
[02:41] <Megidd1> Hi, can someone help me with a problem? I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, but when I boot, it goes to a black screen. I can boot in "recovery mode" then use startx and it works, but I don't want to have to do this every time.
[02:41] <joshjosh> alecwh, sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and comment out the ones you don't need. or do it through synamptic
[02:41] <alecwh> thanks
[02:41] <mlalkaka> katharos: i'm out of ideas, unfortunately. have you tried google?
[02:42] <Nushio> I need help configuring Ubuntu's Display
[02:42] <Vlet> TorvusLinalds: I also had problem with my ATI card after attempting an upgrade. a clean install worked fine
[02:42] <epidodi> I'm afraid the man page is written in greek and I am too dumb to get it
[02:42] <Nushio> it won't start the gdm
[02:42] <sergio_>  what graphic card do you have ?
[02:42] <sergio_>  Look, I just have the same problem after installed 7.10.
[02:42] <sergio_>  I when to the System, Administration, Screen & Graphics and selected the correct driver
[02:42] <sergio_>  In my case Nvida 6 series and all the resolutions came fine.
[02:42] <Pelo> evolution always opens offline now, anywone know how to fix that ?
[02:42] <kilopopo> How do i change the orange background where the splash screen shows when i login to gnome????????????????
[02:42] <kevinO> LjL, thanks I figured it out, seems that one of the lines was commented out because it had failed to verify upon installation, i just un-commented it and its working now.
[02:42] <joshjosh> Megidd1, What video card are you using?
[02:42] <Lilacor> where can I find more information about using KVM with Gutsy?
[02:42] <Megidd1> joshjosh: ATI XPRESS 200
[02:42] <Vlet> kilopopo: I told you earlier. In the 'Login Window' admin control panel
[02:42] <katharos> mlalkaka: sigh, yeah. I'll give it another shot, i'll uninstall the drivers then install the nvidia-glx instead of nvidia-glx-new or something
[02:42] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, .... goddammit i will lose so much if i reinstall... all my settings
[02:42] <KuJaX> What does everyone use their Ubuntu-Server for?
[02:43] <Pelo> kilopoppo do you mean just after you log in while the desktop is loading ?
[02:43] <mrg> desktop effects are only happy on nvidia cards?
[02:43] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> Megidd1:  same card as me
[02:43] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, and i will have to burn a dvd etc....
[02:43] <hordag> how can i get away the glassplate on that the cube is standing on while rotating. it ruins my skydome!
[02:43] <katharos> mlalkaka: thanks so much for your help tho, you're the most helpful person i've met on irc so far
[02:43] <Vlet> TorvusLinalds: like what?
[02:43] <kevinO> And thanks to all the people who tried to make it look like they were helping but actually belittle me in the process
[02:43] <trogdor> Nushio: lshw, lspci, ddcprobe, apt-get install xresprobe restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
[02:43] <Pici> hordag: disable the cube reflection plugin.
[02:43] <kwtm> I typed "man 7zip" and it said, "What manual page do you want from section 7zip?"  What does that mean?  If I want to read instructions on how to use the 7zip command, how do I know what manual page I want?
[02:43] <mlalkaka> katharos: that actually might have something to do with it. nvidia-glx might have support for older cards like ours.
[02:43] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> Megidd1:  its a pain i wouldnt bother  trying  i can help you sort your screen size if you need
[02:43] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, well maybe i could back up my home dir
[02:43] <katharos> mlalkaka: i have hope! :D
[02:43] <Nushio> trogdor: I was looking for some command similar to system-config-display
[02:43] <Pelo> kilopopo, do you mean just after you log in while the desktop is loading ?
[02:44] <Nushio> I upgraded (i think) my brother's pc
[02:44] <joshjosh> Megidd1, your xorg.conf is probably pointed at a driver that doesn't work.
[02:44] <Vlet> TorvusLinalds: there ya go :)
[02:44] <mlalkaka> katharos: good, you'll be happy you did once you've solved the problem; trust me.
[02:44] <trogdor> Nushio: there is no program or command, just find xorg.conf and pwn it with your inovation
[02:44] <ePax> Is there are program with wich you can start LAMP programs at same time and stop them or separated?
[02:44] <kilopopo> Pelo, yes
[02:44] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, it's still a *huge* pain in the ass
[02:44] <Megidd1> I did the restricted driver update while in recovery joshjosh
[02:44] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, and i will have to burn a boot dvd
[02:44] <Nushio> alright, thanks trogdor
[02:44] <joshjosh> Megidd1, alt+f2 then restricted-manager and see if it's enabled.
[02:44] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> joshjosh:  ati spress 200 doesnt support 3d rendering  at least i dont think so
[02:44] <TorvusLinalds> vlet, unless there's a way to do it without one

[02:46] <RB2> Hey everyone. My friend is having a strange issue with 7.04. It seems to be randomly launching multiple copies of the calculator on its own.
[02:46] <kwtm> saturdayplace: It should show up on your desktop and you can use the context-menu options.
[02:46] <bqmassey> should i enable UPnP in Deluge?
[02:46] <RB2> Any suggestions for finding the problem?
[02:46] <Tom47> do deleted files go to a trash bucket when you delete using gksudo nautilus?

[02:46] <mlalkaka> katharos: one more thing that might help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia. Look at the Common Problems section

[02:50] <groobox> Why I can delete cd-rw with k3b only if I start it by root?
[02:50] <Cable86> is there a compiz fusion repository anywhere for ubuntu 7.10?
[02:50] <Berzerker> I had 2.2.0 installed, and apt-get installs 2.2.1

[02:51] <Colro> Is anyone else having problems with games in Ubuntu 7.10 under WINE freezing periodically for 2-4 seconds? It seems like any game will do it -- Warcraft 3, HL mods, WoW, etc. It seems to happen fairly often, but at random times. I thought at first that it might be compiz fusion, but running with DISPLAY=:0 and WINEDEBUG=fixme-all doesn't fix it. I've tried emulating different versions of Windows and I've also tried several older versions of

[02:56] <Necrosan> whyameye, ndiswrapper is superior
[02:56] <Berzerker> it's the newest model
[02:56] <Necrosan> thats why he suggested it
[02:56] <RB2> mrg, Now it's prompting him to save a screenshot and the program switcher that spins the thumbnails in a circle is coming up and switching apps on its own. As well, the keyboard is unresponsive.
[02:56] <Berzerker> I got it in August
[02:56] <Steven_Laptop> people google is your friend!
[02:56] <Andy---> I just installed ubuntu 7.10 on my laptop and it takes a very long time to boot. I installed boot chart and it looks like S01readahead and readahead-list start and then nothing happens for around 70 seconds. Any suggestions?
[02:56] <user_> trogdor:!!! that's nice, I'll try to look around for what's happening, any suggestions for a start-off?
[02:56] <whyameye> Necrosan: not with my system. All sorts of problems. Can't find hidden ESSIDs for example...
[02:56] <RB2> mrg, Maybe he needs to change his kb again.
[02:56] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> Google owns the internet
[02:56] <scguy318> Berzerker: hmm, a MacBook, any windows drivers for those? :P
[02:56] <Berzerker> lol
[02:56] <RB2> mrg, Yes, I'm running 7.10
[02:56] <scguy318> Berzerker: for your wireless chipset
[02:57] <Necrosan> whyameye, uh, isnt that why they're hidden?
[02:57] <Vlet> asbani: anyway, that's weird - I don't recall having to do that on my system at work with vbox on it... have you tried doing what it said?
[02:57] <scguy318> Berzerker: there probably are, though I don't feel like looking
[02:57] <marx2k> have people figured out the NVidia issue and gutsy breaking NVidia?
[02:57] <Anick> Vlet: I have a ati 9800 and i've let ubuntu install the driver and it did not work plus i've downloaded the ones from ATI and i get the same thing
[02:57] <xIke_> anyone know how to control keyboard backlighting from the shell?
[02:57] <scguy318> Berzerker: hmm, your original issue, I dunno :(
[02:57] <whyameye> Necrosan: my univ has hidden ESSID which they tell us, but with ndiswrapper I can't get on.
[02:57] <Berzerker> yes, comes with boot camp
[02:57] <Necrosan> whyameye, try harder
[02:57] <trogdor> user_: I don't know I use compiz if anything :/
[02:57] <scguy318> Berzerker: i guess you could use ndiswrapper with that windows driver
[02:57] <asbani> Vlet: nop
[02:57] <whyameye> Necrosan: I have. And I found madwifi is fantastic.
[02:57] <b4sic> hey i tried to run a 7.10 live boot disc (x64 iso, amd) and got this error msg. first time i've ever seen it (np with previous versions of ubuntu live booting on this pc) .. "bcm43xx error: microcode," "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available, r load failed."
[02:57] <b4sic> any ideas?
[02:57] <mrg> rb2, there are some programs that show you graphically what keys are being pressed.. he should get one of those to see if his kb is fubar.  or just spend 5 bucks and buy a new one to test.
[02:57] <user_> trogdor: ok, thanks for the help , really appreciated
[02:57] <b4sic> anyone? :(
[02:57] <asbani> but i've done vbox and install winxp before, this error never happen to me. and i never did what it says
[02:57] <Necrosan> madwifi is a joke
[02:57] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> synaptic is very handy who ever pointed that out thnxs a treat
[02:58] <Vlet> Anick: have you checked this out...https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[02:58] <Berzerker> whyameye: I already had it installed, then upgraded to gutsy, then it doesn't work, how would I re-configure it to work?
[02:58] <b4sic> very quick question, i'm sure someone here knows the answer..
[02:58] <b4sic> hey i tried to run a 7.10 live boot disc (x64 iso, amd) and got this error msg. first time i've ever seen it (np with previous versions of ubuntu live booting on this pc) .. "bcm43xx error: microcode," "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available, r load failed."
[02:58] <tophatandy> anyone know how to get the deskbar embedded again?
[02:58] <trogdor> user_: if you get fed up with the lag try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=125084
[02:58] <mrg> rb2, do you have desktop effects enabled/working?
[02:58] <Necrosan> b4sic, you idiot, that's bcm43xx-fwcutter shit
[02:58] <Necrosan> dont worry about it
[02:58] <Pici> !repeat | b4sic
[02:58] <b4sic> dude,
[02:58] <ubotu> b4sic: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[02:58] <b4sic> it won't load.
[02:58] <xIke_> I can't wake up from suspend.  anyone?
[02:58] <b4sic> ubotu it just keeps trying to load.
[02:58] <Vlet> asbani: well, give it a shot. If I remember correctly, I had to restart my system after installing vboxx
[02:58] <scguy318> Berzerker: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[02:58] <RB2> mrg, He's been running the desktop effects for months without incident.
[02:58] <insane> hey, I'm having trouble making my TV as my primary or secondary monitor, i dont care which...I tried unsuccessfully in the old version and in the new version I'm not sure what to try
[02:58] <scguy318> Berzerker: applies just fine to Gutsy
[02:59] <Berzerker> scguy318: whyameye already said I should stick to madwifi lol
[02:59] <whyameye> Berzerker: I have a macbook here runnning madwifi on gutsy. I'll take a look. What are your symptoms? Or if you want to go with ndiswrapper, I'm not interested in arguing with people here, so that's fine.
[02:59] <b4sic> guess no one knows ansr.
[02:59] <b4sic> oh well.
[02:59] <ooFeMoe9re> The most interesting thing about Ubuntu (Linux) is:
[02:59] <Andy---> I just installed ubuntu 7.10 on my laptop and it takes a very long time to boot. Any suggestions?
[02:59] <Vlet> b4sic: google might
[02:59] <Paxton> Okay another quick question: I have Gutsy on CD and I want to partition my Dell's HD so I can dual boot until I'm fully comfortable with ubuntu. Is there a way to do this without wiping the windows partition?
[02:59] <Ashfire908> is there any way to stop fsck?
[02:59] <tophatandy> anyone know how to embed the deskbar
[02:59] <user_> trogdor: hemm, I'll try it if nothing works :D
[02:59] <Anick> Vlet: any way you can private msg me
[02:59] <Pici> tophatandy: What do you mean by embed?
[02:59] <mrg> rb2, not him, YOU... i'm trying to see if you can help me :P
[02:59] <bqmassey> I'm gonna try installing PeerGuardian....   unless there's something better out there.. thoughts?
[02:59] <Berzerker> whyameye: nothing goes wrong, no errors, just doesn't show up in ifconfig, or the wireless menu
[02:59] <Vlet> Paxton: yes, the ubuntu installer will do that for you. You can select what percentage of your drive you would like to use, and ubuntu will do the rest
[02:59] <RB2> mrg, OH! Yes, I do. :)
[02:59] <tophatandy> I mean i dont want it in the window anylonger
[03:00] <asbani> Vlet: I done it. now it wants me to put a group add or something
[03:00] <tophatandy> i want it the way it used to be
[03:00] <gutsy> thanks
[03:00] <Vlet> Anick: no. I don't know much about getting fglrx working on ATI cards
[03:00] <tophatandy> in 7.04
[03:00] <Paxton> Thanks Vlet, I'll go do that
[03:00] <gutsy> now compiz go
[03:00] <gutsy> bye bye
[03:00] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> holly crap linux is very powefull i can  do  more on this than i can on xp  it seems more open platform
[03:00] <Pici> tophatandy: Yes, unfortunately, that option isnt available anymore.  I'd like it back too.
[03:00] <mrg> rb2, i have an ati card and it took me forever to get compiz working on 7.04..  now i'm trying to get desktop effects on ubuntu but it doesn't seem to work for ati cards.. is it only for nvidia?
[03:00] <Anick> Vlet: ok
[03:00] <Vlet> asbani: hang on - I have to install virtualbox too, so let me try this too
[03:00] <tophatandy> alright thanks for the help
[03:00] <LordLimecat> sorry, i just missed your reply
[03:01] <LordLimecat> who just said something? closed window :\
[03:01] <Colro> Is anyone else having problems with games in Ubuntu 7.10 under WINE freezing periodically for 2-4 seconds? It seems like any game will do it -- Warcraft 3, HL mods, WoW, etc. It seems to happen fairly often, but at random times. I thought at first that it might be compiz fusion, but running with DISPLAY=:0 and WINEDEBUG=fixme-all doesn't fix it. I've tried emulating different versions of Windows and I've also tried several older versions of
[03:01] <Colro> WINE with no luck.
[03:01] <LordLimecat> colro, i get that
[03:01] <Anick> Mrg: i have problems with it to
[03:01] <ooFeMoe9re> Colro: i get that also
[03:01] <Vlet> Colro: I use Cedega. google it
[03:01] <mrg> anick: you have ati card as well?
[03:01] <Xera> Anyone got a SpeedTouch 330 working in 7.10? I get an error about /proc/bus/usb/devices not existing.
[03:01] <Anick> mrg: yes
[03:01] <LordLimecat> cedega, from what i hear, has worse performance than wine
[03:01] <Pici> Colro: Have you tried asking in #winehq?
[03:01] <RB2> mrg, No. it should work for ATI cards. What driver are you using?
[03:01] <LordLimecat> and i also hear its development is glacial
[03:01] <tophatandy> very true about cedega
[03:01] <MoLerner> My videocard is displaying weird flickering artifacts after coming out of suspend in Vista. would moving to Grub + dualboot have caused this?
[03:01] <Colro> Pici: yep
[03:02] <Pici> hm
[03:02] <Powerking89670> LordLimecat: I wouldnt doubt it...they're not OS are they?
[03:02] <LordLimecat> wine has a new version every 2 weeks, so generally issues are shortlived
[03:02] <matthew1429> how do i find out how much drive space is free on hda?
[03:02] <Colro> Pici: I never had this problem with 7.04 running the same version of WINE.
[03:02] <marx2k> question:I am running Fiesty on my laptop, and I insert a Gutsy CD but it just comes up as amounted ISO and doesnt give me the option of upgrading via the CD... how do i get this to work?
[03:02] <Pici> Colro: Were you using desktop effects then?
[03:02] <Steven_Laptop> MoLerner, no
[03:02] <LordLimecat> Powerking89670: i understand they essentially leeched off of wine, closesourced it, and focused on patches rather than fixes
[03:02] <whyameye> Berzerker: try something like "wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor"
[03:02] <RB2> mrg, Do you get an error when attempted to enable desktop effects?
[03:02] <LordLimecat> wine changed their license to prevent that, so cedega stagnated
[03:02] <mrg> rb2: well first i tried whatever it defaults to after a clean install, then i tried with the proprietary drivers that 7.10 is nice enough to automate the install of
[03:03] <astro76> marx2k, you can only use the alternate cd to upgrade with
[03:03] <Colro> Pici: No, but I disable them while the game's running so that shouldn't effect it one bit.
[03:03] <marx2k> oh :(
[03:03] <Powerking89670> LordLimecat: wow, sounds like a typical Microsoft Story
[03:03] <bidou> ubuntu-fr
[03:03] <Berzerker> whyameye: wlanconfig: ioctl: no such device
[03:03] <LordLimecat> heh, except cedega was somewhat decent
[03:03] <Anick> RB2: I do can you help me
[03:03] <astro76> marx2k, or online of course
[03:03] <mrg> rb2: yeah.. it tries for a few seconds then says it can't (although i had beryl going on 7.04)
[03:03] <LordLimecat> ie, it wont rape your family and steal your car
[03:03] <LordLimecat> ;)
[03:03] <Steven_Laptop> lol
[03:03] <marx2k> that sucks :)
[03:04] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> cedeager?
[03:04] <matthew1429> how do i find out how much drive space is free on hda?
[03:04] <RB2> mrg, Do you have the exact error message?
[03:04] <Xera> Anyone got a SpeedTouch 330 working in 7.10? I get an error about /proc/bus/usb/devices not existing.
[03:04] <whyameye> Berzerker: modprobe ath_pci
[03:04] <mrg> matthew: df
[03:04] <astro76> matthew1429, df -h will list in megabytes
[03:04] <asbani> why alt+ctrl+del doesn't restart X for me?
[03:04] <Berzerker> no errors.
[03:04] <xIke_> I can't resume after suspend
[03:04] <Berzerker> but didn't show up
[03:04] <astro76> matthew1429, and GB
[03:04] <asbani> and its there in keyboard shortcut btw
[03:04] <Berzerker> anywhere
[03:05] <LordLimecat> asbani: try ctrl alt backspace
[03:05] <whyameye> Berzerker: try an ifconfig again then...
[03:05] <stemount> asbani, isn't it ctrl alt backspace?
[03:05] <mrg> rb2, lemme try again 1 min
[03:05] <matthew1429> thx, I had a drive go bad on me :(
[03:05] <Berzerker> only eth0 and lo
[03:05] <RB2> mrg, ok.
[03:05] <LordLimecat> ctrl alt delete either does nothing, process manager, or reboot on linux :)
[03:05] <asbani> ah wait yea its ctrl alt backspace
[03:05] <whyameye> then try the wlanconfig command again...
[03:05] <asbani> and i did that, that what i meant
[03:05] <stemount> lol
[03:05] <stemount> :P
[03:05] <asbani> it doesn't do it for me, but its there in shortcut
[03:05] <asbani> >_<
[03:05] <junkeR> hey, is there a way to search for all the files I marked w/ special emblems???
[03:05] <marx2k> ok... so have people been getting their NVidia driver issues resolved?
[03:06] <Steven_Laptop> marx2k, nvidia works fine on my latop with daul display even
[03:06] <Linux_Galore> I couldnt find any Kubuntu Gutsy CD artwork so I have posted some on www.kde-look.org  just now
[03:06] <Vlet> asbani: okay, yeah, that's easy... do you know how to add yourself to a group?
[03:06] <xIke_> anyone know how to fix suspend/resume not working?
[03:06] <whyameye> anybody here with a dv2000? I can't get suspend or hibernate to work on mine. AMD64 Gutsy
[03:06] <mrg> rb2: "The composite extension is not available"

[03:07] <zetheroo> anyone help me with a fingerprint reader problem?
[03:07] <asbani> Vlet: I done that. i added myself to vboxuser group from system > admin > Group managing
[03:07] <marx2k> I got it working on my GeForce 6200 though
[03:07] <Vlet> asbani: and it works now?
[03:07] <asbani> yep :)

[03:07] <asbani> im in windows setup now
[03:07] <Berzerker> whyameye: nothing shows up

[03:07] <marx2k> which one
[03:07] <Steven_Laptop> let me see something
[03:08] <Berzerker> whyameye: dealing with wifi
[03:08] <whyameye> Berzerker: it didn't return something with the wlanconf like "ath1" or something?
[03:08] <Berzerker> nope
[03:08] <Berzerker> just eth0 and lo
[03:08] <Ashfire908> i need help with sending a signal. according to the manfile signal(7), SIGSTOP cannot be ignored. yet, when i send it to fsck, it doesn't stop
[03:08] <RB2> mrg, Just give me a moment. Looking something up.
[03:08] <andy__> any good burning apps running on gtk now that compete with k3b ?
[03:08] <Berzerker> maybe I should try a clean install of it
[03:08] <Berzerker> how would I do that
[03:08] <mrg> rb2: i've used kubuntu for years.. i even switched to ubuntu for the (supposedly) automatic desktop effects and all i got was the shaft (again) :(
[03:08] <Xera> Anyone got a SpeedTouch 330 working in 7.10? I get an error about /proc/bus/usb/devices not existing..
[03:09] <whyameye> Berzerker: see if "dmesg | grep ath" tells you anything...

[03:10] <Ashfire908> kbrooks, the brightness settings.
[03:10] <putterson> kbrooks, no, I am using it in low light and it is fine for a while but keeps getting darker and darker
[03:10] <whyameye> Berzerker: you should confirm that the card is being found by the hardware with lspci.

[03:13] <Chillin> Ever since is installed 7.10 my computer can't hibernate on windows or ubuntu...
[03:13] <Shpook> So, anyone experiencing freezing issues? It's really driving me crazy
[03:13] <RB2> mrg, ok. I'm running NVidia so I'm not overly familiar with Linux & ATI. But, I'll try my best to help.
[03:13] <mrg> rb2: "0" .. and it's not lying bc it's definitely not on..
[03:13] <marx2k> Steven: post your xorg.conf onto pastebin
[03:13] <myke> Can someone help me configure my screen resolutions?
[03:13] <beerfan> Is it a compiz issue that fullscreen games go windowed sometimes?
[03:13] <whyameye> Berzerker: I'm at a loss. You could try building from the svn repo. Mine is actually running the svn because I wanted packet injection. It's an easy build.
[03:13] <Sippy> is there a repository for wine sources / debs for old versions?
[03:13] <Shpook> Chillin: I can't hibernate either. It'll go into hibernate mode, but never comes out.
[03:13] <Berzerker> but how would I get rid of everything
[03:13] <RB2> mrg, Try changing it to "1" and restarting X.
[03:13] <Berzerker> and do a clean install

[03:14] <myke> Can someone help me configure my screen resolutions?
[03:14] <Foo1> Crap. I just pressed Ctrl-C while my system was upgrading to Gutsy (LAMP server), is there a way to recover/restart?
[03:14] <Chillin> it'll go into hibernate, and turn back on 5 mins later
[03:14] <Steven_Laptop> marx2k, go to #homefront

[03:15] <stemount> ya...

[03:19] <jdong> Foo1: that's not an appropriate way to be asking for help.
[03:19] <astro76> fatcatmatt, in 7.04 it is called gaim
[03:19] <stemount> see what happens
[03:19] <Vlet> Foo1: If you're not getting an answer, that's because no one knows the answer!
[03:19] <matthew1429> is there a scandisk in ubuntu?
[03:19] <Foo1> stemount: I just said that didn't work.
[03:19] <kbrooks> Foo1, if i said that to you, would you help me?

[03:20] <fatcatmatt> astro76: i realize that, but i was able to download it from getdeb.net and install it, but it's not there anymore!
[03:20] <jdong> Foo1: "doesn't work" is horribly vague.
[03:20] <whyameye> matthew1429: fsck
[03:20] <astro76> !fsck | matthew1429
[03:20] <ubotu> matthew1429: fsck is the FileSystem ChecKer, which runs automatically when you boot if you didn't shutdown cleanly. Type "man fsck" for information on running it manually. The command "sudo shutdown -F -r now" will force a reboot and a filesystem check; "sudo touch /fastboot" will skip a filesystem check at next reboot
[03:20] <Josh_> ndan, I just finished setting up my audio, it's a realtek too, would you like the link to the package?
[03:20] <Vlet> Foo1: it seems like the daunting number of newcomers to linux have scared away most people in here that know anything about anything
[03:20] <ndan> Josh_ please
[03:20] <Jimd1> matthew1429: you can dismount the partition, then use sudo fdisk -l to see the device name and then run fsck /dev/sd?# to scan it

[03:21] <Lun> Hi, all, what is the difference between fail safe gnome session and regular gnome session? My application starts slow in regular session but very fast in fail safe session
[03:21] <jdong> Foo1: at what stage did you interrupt?
[03:21] <kbrooks> ndan, no. ubuntu != linux. ubuntu is a linux distribution.
[03:21] <Ashfire908> linux is the kernel. ubuntu is the system.
[03:21] <bruenig> ndan, ubuntu uses linux
[03:21] <Jimd1> the kernel is linux.  the distro is a gnu release with the linux kernel most commonly referred to as linux.
[03:21] <fatcatmatt> im bout to go nuts!  where can i get pidgin from?!

[03:24] <markstos> silvermoonwidow: Kopete with a free MSN account should work.
[03:24] <Ashfire908> fatcatmatt, either use the old 2.0.0 .deb floating on some ubuntu pachage site, or compile your own
[03:24] <TECH_1> My dog wont even eat it..thats bad.
[03:24] <Reng> anyone getting this message when type 'dmesg' and it out put all these 'Inbound IN=eth0 OUT=' how do i fix this??

[03:25] <don-o> an hour into the upgrade, an my gnome-terminal window is no longer responding. im getting a bit nervous, but the upgrade tool seems to be happy.
[03:25] <jdong> Foo1: you look fine to me. Install "ubuntu-desktop" and "ubuntu-minimal" (probably already installed_) then you are fully up to date
[03:25] <Vlet> K2: you get an ssl error when using firefox?
[03:25] <joanki> any must have applications people think i should add?  i need a good program to write and read .doc files and another for .xls anyone have any ideas?

[03:26] <kishan> fatcatmaat go to http://repository.debuntu.org/

[03:26] <joanki> any other must have programs anyone can suggest?

[03:27] <kishan> there is a already a deb package there fatcatmatt
[03:27] <Foo1> one thing I noticed though was that when I did aptitude upgrade the first time after, it wanted to configure an unconfigured ntpd (that's normal, that's where I scrapped it accidentally).. but it also wanted to remove a host of other packages like gaim, python, emacs, etc
[03:27] <Reng> anyone getting this message when type 'dmesg' and it out put all these 'Inbound IN=eth0 OUT=' how do i fix this??
[03:27] <markstos> Mr_Giraffe: Start by running firefox from the command line. You get some error output, right?
[03:27] <Jimd1> vanberg:  gparted is a really nice graphical partition manager.  if that doesn't refer to it you should check it out.
[03:27] <fatcatmatt> been lookin for it, kishan, thx

[03:32] <racarter> thanks
[03:32] <K2> vlet, well, ok, but what about my keyboard and the sound, i cant listen to my music and my keyboard is a mess, do i need a  build-essential package ?
[03:32] <flick> how do i see the task list?
[03:32] <fatcatmatt> BAM!  GOT IT!
[03:32] <Skipster> LordZack what programs are you looking to install?

[03:33] <Vlet> LordZack: what about it never works?
[03:33] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> yep
[03:33] <Weng_Lap> Because there aren't drivers for Vista at all, and it's new enough to have drivers for more or less everything.
[03:33] <fatcatmatt> now, upfwnv03, time to install virtualbox :)
[03:33] <jnc> that's just a factor of manufacturers not bothering to make it work on non-microsoft

[03:34] <cappicard> oh poo: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty-security/Release Unable to find expected entry  multiversedeb/source/Sources in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)

[03:34] <eyemean> hello, ive enabled xserver-xgl so i can have 3d effects with ati 9550
[03:34] <inigomontoya> Unbutu[G33Z3R: you got utorrent working with wine?
[03:34] <mrg> rb2; hold on, i don't seem to have this nick registered or i can't find my password to priv msg ...
[03:35] <eyemean> can someone help me edit me xorg so i can have bigscreen pls, dual monitors
[03:35] <jnc> joanki: if your printer knows postscript, it probably works
[03:35] <LordLimecat> hey, how do you install nvidia-settings under gutsy?
[03:35] <critt> Does anyone know how to resize the cube in Compiz-Fusion?  Can't find that binding or doing something wrong.
[03:35] <bruenig> !find nvidia-settings
[03:35] <ubotu> Found: nvidia-settings
[03:35] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> uea got utorrent working great with wine just ripped it off me  xp drive and opened with wine works a treat
[03:35] <bruenig> !info nvidia-settings
[03:35] <ubotu> nvidia-settings: Tool of configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 1.0+20070502-1ubuntu2 (gutsy), package size 675 kB, installed size 1616 kB (Only available for i386 ia64 amd64)
[03:35] <Skipster> LordZack Which one? there are several available in the repositories... why install from source?
[03:35] <Vlet> LordZack: there's lots of programming environments available that you don't need to compile from source
[03:35] <RB2> mrg, That's ok. This isn't a notebook, right?
[03:35] <jnc> if it's a cheaper kind of printer, then it may not work
[03:35] <joanki> jnc, so i put the cd in?
[03:35] <joanki> jnc, or i just try to plug and play
[03:35] <jnc> just plug it in, I think
[03:35] <LordLimecat> bruenig: if i do apt-get install nvidia-settings, it informs me that it will be removing my driver
[03:35] <jnc> see if you can spot it from the printing system
[03:35] <inigomontoya> Unbutu[G33Z3R: what version of wine are you using, i upgraded to 0.9.47 and it broke some stuff
[03:35] <mrg> rb2, nope, this is a real machine
[03:35] <LordLimecat> that would be...counterproductive
[03:36] <RB2> mrg, a real machine. ;)
[03:36] <bruenig> LordLimecat, that's not good
[03:36] <LordLimecat> yea
[03:36] <LordLimecat> happened in fiesty
[03:36] <Vlet> eyemean: paste your xorg.conf to pastebin and someone might be able to help
[03:36] <LordLimecat> i did a fresh install
[03:36] <LordLimecat> its still doin it

[03:36] <mrg> rb2: no offense to notebook users, of course :)
[03:36] <bruenig> LordLimecat, do apt-cache show nvidia-settings and pastebin it
[03:36] <stemount> if anyone wants super fast speeds downloading gutsy check out
[03:36] <LordLimecat> if i do apt-get install nvidia-glx-new nvidia-settings, it tells me it cannot do that--package conflicts

[03:37] <stemount> i see?
[03:37] <rpj8> Hey guys, how do I search a list of running processes from cli for a certain running process/daemon
[03:37] <Lifeisfunny> Does Ubuntu have a system restore feature like eh-hem, you know who?
[03:37] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> inigomontoya:  installed wine from synaptic just checking now to see if mirc will run
[03:37] <stemount> nope :(
[03:37] <Vlet> rpj8: ps | grep theprocessname
[03:37] <bruenig> rpj8, to get the PID or what?
[03:37] <Skipster> ps -ef |grep <name of daemon>
[03:37] <fatcatmatt> mircer!
[03:37] <bruenig> ps -A, not ps, ps won't get you much
[03:37] <jnc> rpj8: many ways, my favorite is to get a list of everything and then do a regular expression filter to find what I want...  ps aux | grep monkeys
[03:37] <Vlet> rpj8: err... yeah
[03:37] <Lifeisfunny> stemount, bummer
[03:37] <inigomontoya> Unbutu[G33Z3R: the only thing that broke with wine 0.9.47 seems to be 3d games and such
[03:37] <Vlet> bruenig: brainfart :)
[03:38] <asbani> I'm in virtualbox winxp watching a streaming vid live. and the picture isn't clear there. how do I install vga driver in virtualbox winxp?
[03:38] <LordLimecat> whats a paste site? pastebin.nl isnt loading
[03:38] <joanki> oh my GOSH!
[03:38] <Name141> Is it possible to turn off all these flipity floppity animations ?
[03:38] <RB2> mrg, I'm kind of at a loss. Does anyone else here run an ATI x1950 with 7.10?
[03:38] <joanki> ubuntu is amazing

[03:38] <bruenig> joanki, not really
[03:38] <rpj8> thanks all. much appreaciated
[03:38] <stemount> Lifeisfunny, ???
[03:38] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> inigomontoya:  yea i cant run 3d chess in wine it goes all screwey
[03:38] <jnc> joanki: the printer works?
[03:38] <joanki> bruenig:  it just did
[03:38] <bruenig> rpj8, there is a command called pidof, might be more helpful
[03:38] <joanki> yes it does

[03:38] <ok3sd3> i can never boot ubuntu cd, it always freezes during boot?
[03:38] <LordLimecat> Lifeisfunny: thanks, found it :)
[03:38] <ok3sd3> any idea how to get around this problem?
[03:38] <joanki> bruenig: why not?  it isnt working for you?
[03:38] <Name141> They seem to slow down the loading and crap of things .
[03:39] <Lifeisfunny> stemount, I thought you were answering my post, sorry
[03:39] <bruenig> LordLimecat, Conflicts: nvidia-glx-new, nvidia-glx
[03:39] <Lifeisfunny> never mind
[03:39] <inigomontoya> Unbutu[G33Z3R: i'm completely amazed that wine runs teamfortress 2 so well
[03:39] <bruenig> LordLimecat, there is your problem
[03:39] <stemount> i did :(
[03:39] <stemount> but failed
[03:39] <stemount> :(
[03:39] <asbani> inigomontoya: nop, from where do I get them
[03:39] <jnc> ok3sd3: others are reporting the same thing
[03:39] <LordLimecat> yea, i just saw that
[03:39] <joanki> i had a problem with nvidia, too, bruenig
[03:39] <joanki> you mean your video
[03:39] <joanki> card right
[03:39] <LordLimecat> except i KNOW it works with nvidia-glx-new--this is an artificial limitation
[03:39] <Lifeisfunny> stemount, so I guess you don't know what's meant when someone uses the word 'bummer'
[03:40] <inigomontoya> asbani: in the window where you have xp running, go to the devices menu and at the bottom it says "install guest additions"
[03:40] <LordLimecat> its only the ubuntu package that will refuse to work with it, however, for safety's sake i want to use the ubuntu one
[03:40] <mrg> rb2, don't worry about it man, i appreciate your efforts.  i'll keep searching or put my card on ebay :P
[03:40] <LM22> how do I enable the trash on the desktop?
[03:40] <LordZack> im trying to install Anjuta but when i get to the configure part it says that c can configure something like that
[03:40] <LordLimecat> is there ANY way to...er..force it to happen
[03:40] <bruenig> joanki, I meant to say it isn't amazing, like as an OS, it is lacking compared to some other distros
[03:40] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> i just installed unbuntu today and playing about.... steap learning curve but  i like the freedom i have
[03:40] <asbani> inigomontoya: what? Where do I click that.
[03:40] <joanki> bruenig: which ones do you prefer
[03:40] <mrg> rb2: which card do you have, btw. if i get a new one i want to make sure at least that one works..
[03:40] <stemount> Lifeisfunny, yeah. I am british :P
[03:40] <stemount> lol
[03:40] <inigomontoya> asbani: is your windows xp inside a window?
[03:40] <benzs_s> :<
[03:40] <asbani> inigomontoya: yeah
[03:40] <bruenig> joanki, arch, slackware, etc.
[03:40] <jnc> LM22: I'm sure there's an easier way, but you can get that setting from gconf-editor
[03:40] <bruenig> LordLimecat, do you have apt-file?
[03:40] <joanki> um i dunno what that stuff means
[03:40] <benzs_s> is it easy to just upgrade to gutsy with a feisty install
[03:41] <LordLimecat> let me see
[03:41] <inigomontoya> asbani: is there some menus near the top that say "Machine" "Device" "Help"?
[03:41] <joanki> bruenig: which kind of distributions to you prefer to ubuntu then
[03:41] <asbani> inigomontoya: oh wait, install guest additions. I did that.
[03:41] <Lifeisfunny> stemount, ahhh, and we know what you all are addressing when using bum, hahahahahha
[03:41] <bruenig> joanki, arch, slackware, etc.
[03:41] <jnc> benzs_s: I've heard about 50% success rate
[03:41] <RB2> mrg, I'm running an 8800 GTS 640mb ... Certainly not required for Fusion.
[03:41] <inigomontoya> asbani: oh ok good, there's nothing more you can do now
[03:41] <attunix> anyone familiar with GTK?
[03:41] <asbani> inigomontoya: I installed the guest additions, but still picture isn't really clear.
[03:41] <Vlet> benzs_s: there's a higher chance of things going wrong when upgrading than there is with a clean install
[03:41] <stemount> ??
[03:41] <jnc> benzs_s: mostly people don't have any idea how to do it
[03:41] <stemount> excuse me!!!
[03:41] <stemount> lol
[03:41] <Vlet> !anyone | attunix
[03:41] <ubotu> attunix: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[03:41] <joanki> oops
[03:41] <joanki> i see
[03:41] <inigomontoya> asbani: did you install virtualbox from synaptic?
[03:41] <kousotu> are there any known Visual basic decompliers for Linux?
[03:41] <benzs_s> rgr that
[03:41] <Cody> lol
[03:42] <LordZack> im am trying to install Anjuta and when i do ./configure it says error c can not config
[03:42] <asbani> inigomontoya: using "apt-get"
[03:42] <eyemean> vlet, thanx, my xorg is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41470/
[03:42] <LM22> jnc, do you know what setting?
[03:42] <inigomontoya> asbani: maybe you could remove it and try the binary closed source version from virtualbox.org, apt-get installs the open source version
[03:42] <jnc> LordZack: uh, anjuta should be in the repo
[03:42] <LordZack> repo?
[03:42] <RB2> mrg, I've run it under a variety of NVidia cards. Is that x1950 PCIe?
[03:42] <jnc> repository of software
[03:42] <Ashfire908> updatedb is set up not to search /windows right?
[03:42] <LordLimecat> bruenig: i now have apt-file
[03:43] <attunix> I'm trying to compile a GTK program but keep getting the error that gtk/gtk.h does not exist. my first line is #include <gtk/gtk.h>
[03:43] <Lifeisfunny> stemount, 'bummer' is an expression of dejection or dispair
[03:43] <eyemean> i edited my xorg for 7.04 and that took me for ever to mess about with it, but now it seems different layout in 7.10
[03:43] <bruenig> LordLimecat, ok do apt-file update I think to get what you need
[03:43] <jnc> LordZack: that means, use synaptic and install it that way
[03:43] <asbani> inigomontoya: give me the source
[03:43] <mrg> rb2: wow. spiffy. well i'm glad the latest cards are supported.  that card is overkill for most tasks i'm sure.  mine is doing just fine so far for games and whatnot so i hate to spend cash just for incompatibility issues.
[03:43] <don-o> attunix: you need the -dev libgtk package
[03:43] <LordZack> its not working
[03:43] <eyemean> by enabling xserver-xgl, does that slow donw the pc?
[03:43] <mrg> rb2, yeah it's pcie
[03:43] <jnc> LM22: it's in there ... somewhere.  can't be that hard to find
[03:43] <attunix> don-o: sudo apt-get install -dev libgtk ?
[03:43] <jnc> would take me longer to explain it
[03:43] <chowmeined> attunix: aptitude install libgtk+2.0-dev
[03:43] <csc`> what window manager does ubuntu use by default
[03:43] <don-o> attunix: no its libgtk..something..-dev
[03:43] <Vlet> eyemean: this should take care of ya: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1773710
[03:43] <inigomontoya> asbani: the closed source version might work better i'm saying, you have the open source version now if you installed it with apt-get
[03:44] <K2> whats the problem with rhythmbox, i cant listen my music with it, only with XMMS,...????
[03:44] <Skipster> Ubuntu uses Gnome
[03:44] <bruenig> csc`, metacity...
[03:44] <chowmeined> attunix: oops.. libgtk2.0-dev
[03:44] <LordLimecat> bruenig: is apt-file supposed to be slow?
[03:44] <Lifeisfunny> csc`, gnome
[03:44] <bruenig> LordLimecat, very
[03:44] <K2> im in gutsy
[03:44] <jnc> K2: mp3s ?
[03:44] <LordZack> the add/remove applications gets stuck every time i use it
[03:44] <Lifeisfunny> yeah, metacity never mind
[03:44] <csc`> Lifeisfunny, gnome is a desktop environment, not a windowmanager
[03:44] <K2> jnc yes
[03:44] <RB2> mrg, The only card I had problems with was an AGP-based Nvidia.
[03:44] <bruenig> LordZack, don't use it, what are you wanting
[03:44] <Lifeisfunny> csc`, thanks
[03:44] <csc`> bruenig, yeah, metacity looks really fancy with the fading </sarcasm>
[03:44] <jnc> K2: tough luck, until you install some extras which are not legal for distribution
[03:44] <flick> when i log on with kde, fonts are smaller... why is that?
[03:45] <LM22> found it
[03:45] <Vlet> attunix: sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
[03:45] <LordZack> im trying to figure out how to install Anjuta
[03:45] <LM22> thanks
[03:45] <quittt> how do I run old applications for LInux?
[03:45] <sakjur> Need help with gateway
[03:45] <LM22> jnc, thanks
[03:45] <bruenig> csc`, yeah, I think they are going with dwm next time
[03:45] <attunix> chowmeined: I already have that.
[03:45] <jnc> K2: look around for libmad gstreamer plugin
[03:45] <sakjur> How to look out?
[03:45] <jnc> I think
[03:45] <quittt> I have a Netscape 3.04 for Linux... how do I run it?
[03:45] <jnc> LM22: hope that helped
[03:45] <csc`> bruenig, sweet, dwm is the sex
[03:45] <joanki> sometimes, when i mess around with the appearance preferences, my screen gets stuck
[03:45] <bruenig> csc`, next release whatever it's called, look for dwm
[03:45] <LM22> jnc, yeah thanks so much! why isn't that default :D

[03:45] <RB2> mrg, Did you find your FreeNode pw? I'd discuss cards w/ you, but I don't want to clog the channel.
[03:45] <jnc> LM22: it's retarded if you ask me, I don't want ANYTHING on my desktop
[03:45] <bruenig> !automatix | LM22

[03:46] <joanki> in windows, when a window freezes, you hit ctrl alt del, and then hit shut and eventually it does, what is comparable to that in ubuntu?????
[03:46] <stemount> gonna go guys cya
[03:46] <Jimd1> use-lover: yes all the time
[03:46] <bruenig> joanki, killall name

[03:46] <bruenig> LM22, wrong
[03:46] <LM22> haha 50 installs no probs
[03:46] <K2> jnc, oh one more thing, do you know how can i configure my keyboard, its all fucked up, symbols and everything is a big mix..
[03:46] <bruenig> LM22, I have been smoking cigarettes for 20 years and am not dead yet

=== mrg is now known as red22
[03:46] <saturdayplace> ok - on winxp I can connect to my work's server and run it's applicaitons from there over the connection using something from the accessories/communications folder in the start menu.  Is there a way to hit that server though ubuntu?
[03:47] <jnc> joanki: uh...  depends on how badly stuff died
[03:47] <joanki> bruenig: doesn't work
[03:47] <LM22> hoary, edgy, fiesty, gutsy still no problems on mine or other machines I have built
[03:47] <inigomontoya> bruenig: i heard pipe smokers live to 90 on average
[03:47] <Darkkish> how can I make Adobe Flash sound better?
[03:47] <joanki> i have no idea why appearances freezes like that
[03:47] <jnc> joanki: you can forcibly tell X11 to suicide with ctrl+alt+backspace
[03:47] <RB2> Has anyone attempted to make use of the LCD screen on the G35 keyboard under Ubuntu?
[03:47] <bqmassey> i'm so excited
[03:47] <blayde> my understanding was that gutsy would have 2.6.23 kernel. why does it say 2.6.22-14?
[03:47] <LM22> the only issue I have found is for people who try to do upgrades
[03:47] <bqmassey> i'm gonna get high (something fairly new to me)
[03:47] <LM22> instead of fresh installs
[03:47] <Tritonio> hi! is there any way to make the file properties window to be like this: http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/Permissios.png
[03:47] <bruenig> inigomontoya, the point is that there is a thing called analysis, luckily for those who can read python, you can actually look at the script and laugh at the two year old that must have written it
[03:47] <Jimd1> use-lover:  you have a question about it?

[03:48] <joanki> that sucked
[03:48] <Tritonio> jnc, sorry just a moment
[03:48] <LordZack> how do i install Anjuta? I try installing it but when i get to the ./configue it comes up with an error.
[03:48] <kevinO> how do i change my kernel from a server to a desktop?
[03:49] <chowmeined> LordZack: aptitude install anjuta ?
[03:49] <blayde> kevinO, they are the same - you don't have to change
[03:49] <Anick> Is any one willing to do a remote desktop and help me with getting the visual effect to work on ubuntu 7.10 with a ati video card
[03:49] <IdleOne> LordZack: sudo apt-get install ajunta
[03:49] <jnc> LordZack: use synaptic to install, I already done told you
[03:49] <luislo> Jimd1... yes, I first installed the dev version coz that's what they recommended... worked perfectly, except that it is positioned off by 1cm where it should be, so it actually appears 1cm above the actual bottom of my screen... leaving a huge empty below..., SO I tried the stable version... same problem, any ideas?
[03:49] <Qarl> Do people think it's safe to upgrade to Gutsy now? or are there still major problems?
[03:49]  * jnc lobs a grape at LordZack's ear
[03:50] <Vlet> Anick: doubtful
[03:50] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> synaptic is my friend

[03:50] <Tritonio> jnc, http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/Permissions.png
[03:50] <kevinO> blayde: but i cant install any restricted drivers, just to open the manager it says i need to install linux restricted modules 2.6.22-14-server
[03:50] <IdleOne> LordZack: what is the error?
[03:50] <jnc> Qarl: lots of reports that "upgrade" is failing, but fresh install works great
[03:50] <Anick> Vlet: im rdy to pull my hair out lol
[03:50] <chowmeined> Anick: ok if you go into restricted drivers manager, is the ati driver installed?
[03:50] <jnc> Tritonio: so um, what's the problem ?

[03:51] <earlmred> has anybody had problems getting parallels networking to work for an xp guest?
[03:51] <chowmeined> Anick: and if you go to system -> preferences -> appearance on the effects tab
[03:51] <blayde> kevinO, have you installed them?
[03:51] <chowmeined> Anick: and you check the middle box.. what happens?
[03:51] <IdleOne> LordZack: what is the specific error message?
[03:51] <sniper2101> hi all
[03:51] <Anick> chowmeined: no it will not let me enable them
[03:51] <chowmeined> Anick: they are greyed out?
[03:52] <Falstius> can qemu run a vmware image?
[03:52] <blayde> kevinO, er. i mean why cant you install them?
[03:52] <Jimd1>  luislo:  have you tried this link?  http://kishandr.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/how-to-install-avant-windows-manger-in-ubuntu-gusty-throught-repository/
[03:52] <Tritonio> jnc, i prefer this permissions window compared to the one i currently see in ubuntu. is there any way to use it?
[03:52] <kevinO> blayde, it says package not found
[03:52] <LordZack> E: could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open(13 permission denided)
[03:52] <Anick> chowmeined: no i can click on them but a box comes up saying Desktop effect could not be enabled
[03:52] <jnc> Tritonio: oh... I don't know how that is configured, sorry
[03:52] <chowmeined> Anick: then its not available for your computer
[03:52] <jnc> I don't think it's related to the theme
[03:52] <IdleOne> LordZack: use sudo
[03:52] <Jban> Hey guys, new to Ubuntu 7.10, I just put in a DVD of The Descent, and I need a player that will play it correctly.  Totem tried to find a correct Codec, installed it, and it still wouldn't work.  VLC Media player, I cant figure out how to make it play the DVD, and MPLayer tries to play it, and it just skips horribly.  Any help?
[03:53] <wers> I used manual configuration for my network for a while. How do i set Network Manager to manage my wifi connection again?
[03:53] <blayde> kevinO, can you get to System > Administration > Software Sources?
[03:53] <jnc> Tritonio: you might try poking around in gconf-editor, be careful it could mess things up
[03:53] <Anick> chowmeined: why not
[03:53] <Lifeisfunny> LordZack, do you have synaptic open?
[03:53] <Jimd1> jban:  you probably need libdvdcss2
[03:53] <LordZack> ?
[03:53] <luislo> Jimd1, I'm not on ubuntu, I'm using suse with KDE, but not many ppl from that side uses the bar
[03:53] <elliott_> I'm getting a grub error 18 after trying to install dapper, any ideas?
[03:53] <chowmeined> Anick: because your hardware doesnt support it.. or for a bunch of reasons, ubuntu has determined that it cant run it on your computer
[03:53] <LordZack> i have terminal open
[03:53] <Jban> Jimd1: Ok, I will search for it
[03:53] <Tritonio> jnc, was it like this in a previeus ubuntu version? i mean, this guy took the screenshot from his ubuntu system. ok i'll try the gconf-editor. thank you! :-)
[03:53] <kevinO> blayde yes
[03:54] <zengen> I just installed no-ip from the repo and it only starts after I've logged in my user account.  Doesn anyone know how I can get it to start after a reboot before anyone logs in?
[03:54] <siimo> where is #ubuntu+1
[03:54] <marx2k> so thats my Xorg.0.log when I try to run the 'nvidia' driver. http://pastebin.com/m6f817833  == Any suggestions?
[03:54] <luislo> Jimd1, however it worked before so... but you see what I'm saying? did you get an idea of my problem?
[03:54] <chowmeined> Anick: one other thing.. did you restart after you installed the ati drivers?
[03:54] <Anick> chowmeined: I have an P4 2.8, ATI 9800 pro 1 gig ram
[03:54] <blayde> kevinO, make sure all the checkboxes in the Ubuntu Software tab are checked
[03:54] <Jban> Jimd1: Where can I find it? NOthing comes up in the Search under Add/remove
[03:54] <Anick> chowmeined: yes
[03:54] <LordZack> Lifeisfunny: i have teminal open
[03:54] <Jimd1> luislo: i understand your issue and AWN will take some time to flesh out all the bugs.  did you try deleting the config files and then reloading it?
[03:54] <Lifeisfunny> LordZack, ok, never mind, I recall a person gets something like that if they are using the terminal with synaptic also open
[03:54] <kevinO> blayde they are
[03:54] <chowmeined> Anick: and ati makes very poor drivers for linux...
[03:55] <Tritonio> jnc, you were right! it's this key: /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_advanced_permissions
[03:55] <Anick> chowmeined: oh
[03:55] <Jimd1> jban:  probably need to add the medibuntu repositories
[03:55] <jnc> Tritonio: oh hey, thanks for the info
[03:55] <endx> how do you save a file after you've opened it with sudo nano?
[03:55] <levmatta> can anyone tell me how to enable numlock at x startup??
[03:55] <LordZack> so how do i get it?
[03:55] <jnc> Tritonio: I'm glad my guess was helpful
[03:55] <endx> because closing it doesn't save it automatically
[03:55] <blayde> kevinO, now could you go to a terminal and type sudo apt-get update
[03:55] <Anick> chowmeined: so no eye candy for me :(
[03:55] <IdleOne> !numlock | levmatta
[03:55] <ubotu> levmatta: To enable Number Lock by default, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NumLock
[03:55] <Skipster> lordZack did you do sudo apt-get.....
[03:55] <Jban> Jimd1: Could you give me those links?
[03:55] <Vlet> Anick: I got sick of being unable to use my ATI card with compiz, so I went out and bought an nvidia
[03:55] <jnc> I should charge money for these answers, I'm 3 for 3
[03:55] <Lifeisfunny> LordZack, synaptic?  it's in system/administration
[03:55] <levmatta> and no it is not the same as Feisty
[03:55] <elliott_> endx: ctrl+x, then type Y i believe
[03:55] <jnc> that's like $60usd at least right there
[03:56] <jnc> I could buy some beer
[03:56] <Anick> Vlet: yeah guess that is what i will do
[03:56] <endx> elliott_:  thanks
=== harsh is now known as QwertyM
[03:56] <luislo> Jimd1, I wanted to do so, but I didn't know how... where are the config files??
[03:56] <chowmeined> Anick: it works really well on my nvidia card.. even though its pretty old.. i have a geforce 3 and it still works
[03:56] <LordZack> its working
[03:56] <levmatta> ubotu: their is no  /etc/X11/gdm/Init/Defaul in Gusty
[03:56] <Anick> Vlet: any suggest on VC that is easy to run it with
[03:56] <BSG75> 2 question for 7.10, how do I watch dvd using default media player? (I can using xine and mplayer).. how do I get my wheel to scroll, it open up new tabs
[03:56] <Lifeisfunny> cool,
[03:56] <Crush`> as of 7.10 Gutsy, is samba still the best way to use file/print sharing?
[03:56] <Anick> chowmeined: yeah that is an old card
[03:56] <LordZack> nvm now it says could not find package
[03:56] <shane_> I can't get beryl/emerald themes to work in gutsy...anyone have some suggestions for me?
[03:56] <chowmeined> Anick: but i can still do almost all the effects
[03:57] <BSG75> shane_: video card?
[03:57] <elliott_> does anyone know what's causing my grub error 18?
[03:57] <earlmred> how do i bridge two network interfaces in ubuntu? i need to bridge vnic0 to eth1
[03:57] <shane_> I have all of the comiz effects working
[03:57] <LordLimecat> bruenig: ran apt-file update
[03:57] <shane_> I just can't get the themese to apply
[03:57] <LordLimecat> now what :\
[03:57] <Allenwr> Hey, I am having a problem still with my graphic card and ubuntu 7.10
[03:57] <shane_> I have a geforce 7600 I think
[03:57] <IdleOne> LordZack: what instructions are you following?
[03:57] <Jimd1> jban:  in your /etc/apt/sources.list file you should review it, remove the comment indicator the # symbol, from those, and then load synaptic package manager and choose reload.
[03:57] <jnc> BSG75: um, lol @ opening up new tabs.   that can't be fun
[03:57] <Vlet> Anick: I have an EVGA 8600 at work, and an EVGA 7600 at home - both worked with no tweaking
[03:57] <marx2k> ok I inserted the Ubuntu alternate CD into my laptop's drive while it's running Ubuntu... how do I get it to update to gutsy?
[03:57] <Allenwr> I am having problems with getting the driver to work.
[03:57] <Lifeisfunny> shane, I asked that question in compiz and they told me to go to gnome-look.org and dl a file cause emerald is out
[03:57] <shane_> ok, I have emerald
[03:57] <BSG75> :jnc .. slightly confused as u can guess :)
[03:58] <Anick> Vlet: so after the install you could just enable the effects
[03:58] <shane_> but when I seleect a theme I see no way to make it go into effect
[03:58] <chowmeined> Anick: my other comp has a geforce fx5200 and it works great also..
[03:58] <shane_> I'll check gnome-look.org though
[03:58] <charlie> I have a quick question. Is it possible to change that brown color you see sometimes (like when GNOME is first starting, before the wallpaper comes on)?
[03:58] <Anick> chowmeined: i'll have to try on my work pc it was a nvidia
[03:58] <LordLimecat> charlie: yes
[03:58] <chowmeined> Anick: yup.. just installed the driver from the restricted drivers manager.. then clicked the checkbox and they started working
[03:58] <Vlet> Anick: I installed, the "restricted drivers are available" thing popped up, clicked it, enabled, restarted and compiz was working
[03:58] <rpj8> hey guys, I try to run an .sh script... one of the lines is "read -s -e
[03:58] <LordZack> idle one im using the ones i am givin by allot of people
[03:58] <LordLimecat> charlie:  go to "change wallpaper"
[03:58] <kevinO> blayde yes, it still does not work, i think the problem begins with me installing ubuntu-desktop, over server edition, it still thinks it a server, thats why i think needed the normal headers or something, in grub it still says server too
[03:58] <LordLimecat> and change the color
[03:58] <charlie> Ah, I found it LordLimecat, thanks.
[03:59] <LordLimecat> :)
[03:59] <rpj8> hey guys, I try to run an .sh script... one of the lines is "read -s -e", and it's telling methat those are illegal options
[03:59] <Anick> thanks for you help guys
[03:59] <charlie> one more question, how can I set ubuntu up to not show mounted volumes on the desktop?
[03:59] <LordZack> i am trying sudo apt-get install ajunta
[03:59] <crazeej> can someone help me get my sound working?  i upgraded from dapper to gutsy and i can't remember what i needed to do before to get it working...
[03:59] <IdleOne> ok LordZack try this . sudo apt-get install anjuta
[03:59] <jnc> BSG75: it's very explainable behavior, the scroll wheel is actually 3 buttons.  so you have 1 2 4 3 5  (left, right, scroll up, scroll click, scroll down)
[03:59] <wirechief1> elliott see this https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub-installer/+bug/9006
[04:00] <Anick> chowmeined: yeah im new to this linux thing as you could tell but hope i get the hang of it
[04:00] <jnc> BSG75: something must be mucking it up so it thinks that you have three '3' buttons
[04:00] <charlie> one more question, how can I set ubuntu up to not show mounted volumes on the desktop?
[04:00] <Skipster> crazeej what card do you have?
[04:00] <Falstius> charlie: for an internal harddrive or such, change the mount point to something not in /media
[04:00] <charlie> Falstius, how can I do that?
[04:00] <charlie> The volume is automatically mounted when I boot.
[04:00] <kevinO> hello i installed ubuntu-desktop over server edition and it still thinks its a server, how do i make it so it thinks its a desktop?
[04:00] <Falstius> charlie: edit /etc/fstab
[04:00] <jnc> BSG75: i.e. middle button click in (firefox?) is paste a url into a new tab

[04:01] <charlie> !paste | crazeej
[04:01] <ubotu> crazeej: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:01] <LordZack> it didnt work it said command not found
[04:01] <BSG75> jnc: yeah I figured it's something cheesy, I already editted the xorg.conf, I will see if I can scroll by clicking the wheel down..
[04:01] <crazeej> accident
[04:01] <Falstius> charlie: for instance, if your windows hd is mounted to /media/windows do: "sudo mkdir /mnt/windows"  and then change the line in fstab from /media/windows to /mnt/windows
[04:01] <charlie> Yeah, thanks.
[04:01] <IdleOne> LordZack: show me the command you entered please
[04:01] <BSG75> jnc: I think I can figure that out from here on .. any idea on how to watch dvd from the default media player?? all the required stuff is already installed
[04:01] <Arcanimus> Hey guys

[04:02] <LordZack> .sudo apt-get install ajunta
[04:02] <Colro> I'm running an xgl xserver in order to use desktop effects with an ATI card -- is there a way to temporarily disable this upon login without uninstalling it? I can't find the option in sessions.
[04:02] <luislo> Jimd1, I wanted to do so, but I didn't know how... where are the config files??
[04:02] <IdleOne> LordZack: no .
[04:02] <LordLimecat> crazeej: heh, i think i have the same thing, except with an audigy
[04:02] <quittt> is there a place where I can get a Netscape 9 .deb?
[04:02] <LordZack> thats what i was told
[04:02] <Skipster> crazeej try asoundconf --list
[04:02] <Jimd1> luislo:  had to locate it.  it is located in your home folder ~/.config/awn
[04:02] <elliott_> wirechef1: Thanks, i'm reading it now
[04:02] <LordLimecat> works out of the box in gutsy, but under older versions you have to blacklist the intel8x0 driver
[04:02] <IdleOne> LordZack: no . ( dot )
[04:02] <LordLimecat> (i think)
[04:02] <luislo> Jimd1, and which one is it?
[04:03] <eyemean> will software that worked on 7.04 still work on 7.10?
[04:03] <Jimd1> luislo delete the awn folder or rename it to something else
[04:03] <felipe__> Hello, how can I turn of the temperature controls. my computer keeps shutting down because it say de procersor is over 92 degree...in window in never shuts down
[04:03] <niuq> hi i''ve installed ubuntu 7.10, and tried to enable the visual effects but when i chose the option appears a message "the composite extension not avaible"
[04:03] <crazeej> Skipster: CA0106 & CK8
[04:03] <Arcanimus> Okay so I have a bit of a problem here... I'm using 7.10 and I have this same exact issue: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/107320
[04:03] <Jimd1> luislo:  mv ~/.config/awn ~/config/awn.old
[04:03] <pawan1234_> hi
[04:03] <Name141> during configure of things, I get "configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
[04:03] <Arcanimus> except I didn't install the driver myself, it was already installed
[04:03] <Unbutu[G33Z3R> how  cahnge size of icon on me desktop
[04:03] <eyemean> niuq, do u have an ati card?
[04:03] <Arcanimus> and nothing I tried seems to fix it
[04:03] <pawan1234_> how to reintall ubuntu
[04:04] <niuq> eyemean: yes i do
[04:04] <pawan1234_> reupgrade
[04:04] <charlie> eyemean: yes.
[04:04] <Name141> How do I fix that ?
[04:04] <Ademan_> hey does anyone know of a command to kill a given process after a certain amount of time?
=== pawan1234_ is now known as pawan
[04:04] <marx2k> Do I have to be in gnome in order to use the Ubuntu Alternate CD for a Gutsy upgrade?
[04:04] <charlie> Ademan_ you could use an SH script
[04:04] <IdleOne> LordZack: the command to install any package in ubuntu from the repos is    sudo apt-get install ( package name ) so what I need you to type is   sudo apt-get install anjuta
[04:04] <marx2k> does it not work in KDE?
[04:04] <elliott_> wirechief1: Thanks, i'm reading it now
[04:04] <Falstius> Ademan_: sleep 1000 && kill 191232123
[04:04] <crazeej> LordLimecat:  so the intel8x0 driver is the problem?
[04:04] <eyemean> niuq, charlie, which one? 9550?
[04:04] <smmagic> Are there ANY viruses for ubuntu
[04:04] <rcy> whats the right way to arrange for services to start at boot time... i have /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server which I know i can symlink to /etc/init.d/rcN.d, but is there a better way to do it?
[04:04] <LordZack> it worked what do i do now
[04:04] <Ashfire908> ademan_ sleep and kill?
[04:04] <niuq> eyemean: ati radeon m300
[04:04] <niuq> eyemean: something like that
[04:04] <IdleOne> let it do its thing LordZack
[04:05] <Arcanimus> Does anyone else have this issue? The characters in the login text field are much larger than the field itself (7.10, intel 900 card)
[04:05] <blayde> kevinO, what do the choices say in the Software Sources thing?
[04:05] <charlie> eyemean, oh, i was answering your question about whether 7.04 apps will work on 7.10. sorry if your question was already answered.
[04:05] <Ademan_> ah, so i guess i just need to roll my own, that's cool i just didn't want to if there was something preexisting
[04:05] <pawan> hello
[04:05] <charlie> Hello
[04:05] <Skipster> Crazeej so do asoundconf set-default-card <output from asoundcard list
[04:05] <Falstius> Arcanimus: I had that problem in edgy, went away in gutsy.
[04:05] <ndan> yes ubuntu CAN get a virus
[04:05] <IdleOne> LordZack: it should be downloading that package it will then tell you that it is setting up anjuta
[04:05] <pawan> hi
[04:05] <eyemean> charlie, sorry for the misunderstanding, thank you for ur reply, much appreciated
[04:05] <LordZack> it is
[04:05] <Jimd1> luislo:  there's also a config file in ~/.gconf/apps
[04:05] <ndan> `there are like less then 100 known virus' tho i think
[04:05] <LordLimecat> ndan: sorta hard to pull off, innit?
[04:05] <IdleOne> LordZack: depending on your machine it may take a minute or two
[04:05] <charlie> eyemean,  no problem, glad to help :)
[04:06] <Adylass> Hello, Gusty seems to use the XGL xorg server .. But my graphic card (on my laptop) is slow.. I would like to use the normal xorg server .. This can be done ?
[04:06] <bobgill> I have a bunch of .ttf fonts in a mounted partition, how do I move them all to /usr/share/fonts/truetype?  Would it be: "sudo cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype" ?? Don't want to mess it up :)
[04:06] <LordLimecat> i mean, dont you sort of have to want a virus to get one on linux? (or be running wine) :)
[04:06] <niuq> eyemean: i have no support for my ati card?
[04:06] <charlie> Yes bobgill that is correct
[04:06] <elliott_> wirechief1: So I should just manually make a boot partition right at the beginning? How simple is that to do from the alternate install cd?
[04:06] <pawan> how to reintall ubuntu
[04:06] <luislo> Jimd1... I installed in default, which apparently is /usr/local/ would it be a config file there?
[04:06] <Falstius> Ademan_: alternatively you could use cron.  No one has probably made a standalone app for that because it is simple to do with commands that already exist.
[04:06] <pawan> reupgrade
[04:06] <eyemean> niuq, im new to linux, but i found the following thread becuse i couldnt get desktop effects to work, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3530039
[04:06] <Jimd1> your config files are in yoru home folder
[04:06] <IdleOne> LordLimecat: you can download all the windows virii in the world it still wont affect linux
[04:07] <charlie> Pawan, do you say you want to upgrade from 7.04 Feisty to 7.10 Gusty?
[04:07] <Jimd1> luislo:  the ~ indicates your home folder
[04:07] <pawan> yes
=== viper is now known as moparisthebest
[04:07] <Jimd1> luislo:  so if you are at the terminal window and you type cd ~ it will put you in your home folder
[04:07] <ndan> yea well theoretically if your not compiling from source and got a currupted .deb theoretically you could get a virus nay?  runnin an executible.  tho even if u did get one its not as bad as windows it has no admin rights....
[04:07] <LordZack> also my add/remove applications is stuck is their a task manager?
[04:07] <LordLimecat> IdleOne: as i understand it, some bot viruses actually DO run under wine
[04:07] <eyemean> niuq, like i said im new to linux, but it did work for me, i have ati 9550, so i enabled the restricated driver then installed the xserver-xgl component
[04:07] <bobgill> charlie: thanks it worked :) :)
[04:07] <LordLimecat> i would imagine the would continue to run till killed
[04:07] <charlie> Pawan, here is the official HOWTO from Ubuntu to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[04:07] <melkor> Im not sure how to turn on my bluetooth in gnome
[04:08] <IdleOne> LordLimecat: well then if you get a virus under wine then perhaps you need not run wine :)
[04:08] <luislo> Jimd1, yes, I know, but I'm telling you that the default installation (according to the website and I just checked it) is in the /usr/local/ folder... would there also be a config file there?
[04:08] <crazeej> LordLimecat:  so the intel8x0 driver is the problem with my soundcard?
[04:08] <niuq> eyemean: i'll install that component it might work
[04:08] <Falstius> LordLimecat: linux machines certainly can, and are, hacked.  Don't think just because you run linux you can ignore all security worries.
[04:08] <Jimd1> luislo:  so, if you type cd ~/.config it will put you in the hidden folder called config which is located under your home folder
[04:08] <fatcatmatt> im gonna give 7.10 another shot.  if it doesn't work this time, then i will wait for updates to come out for it
[04:08] <wirechief1> elliott just use gparted but know what you are formating make sure its where you want it.
[04:08] <LordLimecat> crazeej: i BELIEVE so, although again, i have the same chipset and a creative audigy, and did not need to do that step
[04:08] <charlie> fatcatmatt: What problems were you having with 7.10?
[04:08] <LordLimecat> Falstius: i understand they can be hacked, but we're talkin viruses
[04:08] <pawan> how to manully upgrade
[04:09] <crazeej> LordLimecat:  well, i'll try it.. the module is in use apparently
[04:09] <LordLimecat> Falstius: i mean, generally, you arent going to get a virus until you get hacked, are ya? uinless youre REALLY uncareful?
[04:09] <charlie> pawan, Why do you want to manually upgrade? Do you not have an available internet connection on the machine you want upgraded?
[04:09] <LordZack> my add/remove applications is stuck how do i close it?
[04:09] <m0u5e> do i have to use the alternate cd to be able to dual boot w/ vista (i'm planning on not installing grub, and just using EasyBSD
[04:09] <Falstius> LordLimecat: if you run unknown scripts from the web ... which a lot of people do.
[04:09] <eyemean> niuq, u mean ubuntu 7.10 does not offer u the restricted driver on tart up?
[04:09] <pawan> i have
[04:09] <charlie> LordZack: Kill it from System Monitor
[04:09] <LordLimecat> Falstius: lol, forkbomb
[04:09] <Jban> Jimd1: Could you re-explain what to do... I'm confused.
[04:09] <LordLimecat> yea, agreed
[04:09] <niuq> eyemean: actually it does offer it
[04:09] <hexstar> hello, is it possible to use apt-get to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10 and if so how? thanks
[04:09] <Jimd1> jban:  do you know how to edit your sources.list file?
[04:10] <luislo> Jimd1, I understand that... and I found the files... but my question is whether or not there will also be a configuration file in somewhere else, like in where the program was installed... which is the folder /usr/local
[04:10] <LordLimecat> but not viruses in the standard sense, since under linux you dont really need to dl all sorts of unknown apps--most are covered by default
[04:10] <kelvie> what's the default $PAGER on ubuntu?
[04:10] <IdleOne> !upgrade | hexstar
[04:10] <ubotu> hexstar: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:10] <m0u5e> hexstar: yes, just sudo apt-get --dist-upgrade
[04:10] <wirechief1> elliott can you do pm for more details ?
[04:10] <kelvie> (and what options does it have on by default)
[04:10] <pawan> i upgraded from 7.04 to 7.10
[04:10] <hexstar> m0u5e: thank you
[04:10] <Jban> Jimd1: Software sources and add third party software?
[04:10] <Falstius> LordLimecat: or even a keystroke logger.  Say in an 'enhanced' version of firefox one might find on the web.
[04:10] <melkor> !bluez
[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about bluez - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[04:10] <Jimd1> luislo:  most likely not but I didn't write the programs, hehe.  i'd say no.
[04:10] <pawan> but in between my power went off
[04:10] <m0u5e> hextstar: or update-manager -d (i think... just update-manager --help)
[04:10] <melkor> !obex
[04:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about obex - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[04:10] <charlie> Melkor: what's your bluetooth problem?
[04:10] <pawan> so it did not complete the entire process
[04:10] <LordLimecat> Falstius: yea, i suppose...hurts to think people fall for it :(
[04:10] <charlie> Can't get File transfers to work?
[04:10] <melkor> charlie I don't know how to turn it on.
[04:10] <pawan> so want to re upgrade
[04:10] <kelvie> bah nevermind :x
[04:10] <geezone> anyone know why with the upgrade ubuntu 7.10the Visual effects dosen't work
[04:11] <charlie> melkor: What dongle do yuo have?
[04:11] <charlie> you*
[04:11] <melkor> charlie its internal
[04:11] <pawan> some files are missing
[04:11] <Falstius> geezone: do you have an ati video card?
[04:11] <eyemean> niuq, in that case u would need to select that first, then allow it to install the drivers, then reboot then install the xserver-xgl
[04:11] <percy> :-(
[04:11] <geezone> yes
[04:11] <pawan> how to fix it
[04:11] <charlie> Melkor: What Brand/Model Laptop do you have?
[04:11] <eyemean> niuq, it worked for me, but i cant gurnatee it will work for u
[04:11] <Falstius> geezone: that is my guess.  I recently installed and don't have them on my laptop either.
[04:11] <melkor> charlie dell vostro 1500
[04:11] <LordLimecat> charlie: just an aside, if you run the live-cd version of gutsy, do you have sound?
[04:11] <s0ldi> whois s0ldi
[04:11] <Jimd1> jban:  it is very hard to help if you don't know what your sources.list file is.  the sources.list file is a file in your /etc/apt folder on your hard drive.  in order to edit it you should open a terminal window, then type sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:11] <elliott_> wirechief1: Hold on, i have to get an actual name and register first
[04:11] <charlie> LordLimecat: yeah, i do.
[04:11] <m0u5e> geezone: if you're using an ATI / Nvidia then you need to install the restricted drivers for 3d support
[04:12] <luislo> thanks Jimd1, I'm gonna make a fresh install... what do you recommend me... stable or dev? (I ask this coz in their website awnguys recommend dev...
[04:12] <geezone> i had a feeling that was the issue, but wasn't sure
[04:12] <melkor> charlie at this point I don't know if its not working or if I just haven't enabled it.  The light isn't lit up.
[04:12] <m0u5e> pawan: sudo dpkg --configure -a
[04:12] <wirechief1> elliott ok
[04:12] <LordLimecat> charlie: :\ well, worst case, a fresh install probably WOULD fix it if noone else has a solution
[04:12] <Jimd1> jban:  when the editor launches it will have the contents of your third party sources.  you then review it to find those lines that begin with deb
[04:12] <pawan> how to install nvidia drivers
[04:12] <LordLimecat> not that that would be first option
[04:12] <quittt> is it possible to install Communicator 4.8 on Ubuntu:?
[04:12] <Adylass> Hello, Gusty seems to use the XGL xorg server .. But my graphic card (on my laptop) is slow.. I would like to use the normal xorg server .. This can be done ?
[04:12] <pawan> i have fx5200 card
[04:12] <Jban> Jimd1: ok i see them
[04:12] <Jimd1> jban:  then remove the pound symbol (#) from the beginning of the line and then save the changes.
[04:12] <felipe__> how do I turn off apic forever. my computer keeps turning off
[04:13] <addicted68098> For some reason the file browser seems to be taking up the entire screen (including the taskbars) and the only way out, is to alt+tab
[04:13] <jimmygoon> Does anyone else's laptop log off when you close the lid?
[04:13] <Jban> Jimd1: BUt I see "deb" and there is no # sign infront of deb
[04:13] <wirechief1> felipe did you try using noapic boot cheat ?
[04:13] <Jimd1> luislo:  i can't say.  I'm learning too
[04:13] <Falstius> felipe__: is it ubuntu saying your computer is overheating or the bios?
[04:13] <pawan> when i enable driver i stuk at terimanl
[04:13] <Jimd1> jban:  those without the pound sign mean they are active already
[04:13] <IdleOne> pawan: seems to me you dont want to finish anything you start. just a minute ago you were trying to finish an upgrade now you want to install nvidia drivers . why not try starting one thing ( understanding / finishing it ) then try something else .
[04:13] <m0u5e> pawan: yeah, so make sure install the restricted drivers, go under system settings>restricted drivers
[04:13] <pawan> when i disable machine loads properly
[04:13] <LordZack> where can i find a complete list of all the software that can be put onto my machine?
[04:13] <charlie> Can't seem to find anything about bluetooth on that model. Never heard of the "Vostro" line myself..just inspiron and latitudes. Anyway, have you tried going to System > Preferences > Bluetooth?
[04:13] <Jban> Jimd1: I see so only the ones with #signs
[04:13] <joanki> is there a site that posts reviews of open source applications to make choosing the best one easier?
[04:13] <gvsa123> why can't i make the firestarter icon appear on the system tray?
[04:13] <felipe__> wirechief1: yup I hit e on grub then e again add the noapic nolap
[04:14] <m0u5e> anyone here running a gutsy dell m1330
[04:14] <Jimd1> jban: if you see a line that starts with # deb
[04:14] <nekostar> m0u5e: whats the problem
[04:14] <m0u5e> my batt life is extremely short... why is my cpu running full blast?
[04:14] <Jimd1> then remove the #
[04:14] <dystopianray> joanki: what are you trying to choose between?
[04:14] <wirechief1> felipe does that work ?
[04:14] <joanki> like finance software
[04:14] <joanki> or like the best french software
[04:14] <joanki> just stuff like that
[04:14] <nekostar> o
[04:14] <felipe__> wirechief1: nolapic option but it keeps turning off, it says the processor or something si on 98 degrees...
[04:14] <m0u5e> i only tried it onthe live cd, but i noticed that problem off the bat
[04:14] <blayde> kevinO, sorry i couldn't help you, but i have to go. if you explain your situation and what i had you do i hope someone else can help you
[04:14] <Jban> Jimd1: Ok, I did that and there were only 2 #debs
[04:14] <charlie> m0u5e, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellXPSM1330
[04:14] <m0u5e> okay thx
[04:14] <nekostar> you need to reconfigure powernow or something
[04:14] <m0u5e> carlie: you wouldn't happen to know how to dual boot gutsy and vista would you? :D
[04:14] <Ashfire908> what is the difference between /mnt and /mount?
[04:15] <IdleOne> gvsa123: Applications > Internet > Firestarter ( right click ) add to panel
[04:15] <nekostar> its probably just not stepping correctly
[04:15] <nekostar> Ashfire908: the word
[04:15] <wirechief1> felipe noapic  not nolapic
[04:15] <Jban> Jimd1: It said that I do not have the permissions to save the file and to check that I typed in the location correctly and try again.
[04:15] <Jimd1> jban:  my default sources.list file had many many lines starting with # deb
[04:15] <Ashfire908> sorry, what is the difference between /mnt and /media
[04:15] <jnc> die software firewall, die a burning death.
[04:15] <m0u5e> nekostar: yeah thats what i was thinking...
[04:15] <Ashfire908> still just the word?
[04:15] <charlie> m0u5e, CPU Frequency Scaling is reported to work on Gusty with your laptop model. See if you can manually do it by Right clicking your gnome panel, and hitting add to panel. then choose the CPU scaler
[04:15] <nekostar> Ashfire908: and the actual place but yeah
[04:15] <nekostar> you could make it 'zomgthisisanawesomething'
[04:15] <joanki> does anyone have any recommendatinos on websites that reviews open source software?
[04:15] <Jimd1> jban:  because you don't have permission.  you can't just double click on it and expect ot be able to edit it.  this isn't windows.  you need to think about how linux keeps you safe from yourself.
[04:16] <melkor> charlie yeah I went to that but when I check the box I still don't get a light.  Ill play with it some tomorrow, I was thinking I might not have a good program to use the bt
[04:16] <jnc> Ashfire908: /media in Ubuntu is "dynamic"
[04:16] <pawan> hello
[04:16] <nekostar> joanki: try ubuntuforums.org
[04:16] <csc`> how do you fool around with compiz on ubuntu :s?
[04:16] <charlie> melkor: BlueZ
[04:16] <nekostar> as a starting place
[04:16] <Dr_willis_> !compiz

[04:16] <joanki> thx
[04:16] <quittt> why there is not deb for Netscape 9?
[04:16] <Jban> Jimd1: I didnt double click; i did what you said and clicked save.
[04:16] <charlie> melkor: actually i'm not totally familiar with Bluetooth on Linux.
[04:16] <jnc> Ashfire908: anything automagically recognized and mounted from HAL system goes in /media
[04:16] <charlie> quittt: it's really not necessary.
[04:16] <melkor> thanks though.
[04:16] <jnc> Ashfire908: /mnt is the legacy *nix place used for mounting partitions
[04:16] <djlenoir> back with another request for help with my bluetooth mouse and keyboard. can someone please help me with this? i am closer i think as the bluetooth usb adapter is showing up as hci0 with an address... bluetooth preferences shows a mouse and keyboard but they don't work... I did say to trust the connection and reboot but that did not help.
[04:16] <charlie> quittt, you can just download it and run it, no need to compile or install.
[04:17] <Jimd1> jban:  you were in the terminal window and typed "sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" (without the quotes)?
[04:17] <gvsa123> IdleOne: no... i mean i want the icon to be present in the system tray when it's running... it is running, but there's no icon...
[04:17] <jimmygoon> joanki, why in god's name are you using netscape 9?
[04:17] <felipe__> wirechief1: why? here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions it gives both options
[04:17] <joanki> im not
[04:17] <joanki> i have no idea why it would say that
[04:17] <jimmygoon> joanki, sorry, read the wrong name :D
[04:17] <IdleOne> gvsa123: check the prefs probably a box that needs to be checked off
[04:17] <joanki> haha
[04:17] <joanki> ok repeat that question to someone else .... . . . .
[04:17] <jimmygoon> I feel like an IRC nub
[04:17] <gvsa123> IdleOne: i have sudo firestarter --start as the command but for some reason, the icon won't show when it's running... also have that ticked already...
[04:17] <jnc> djlenoir: for $10 you can get a wired keyboard, to be very honest you may get this working eventually, but it's not likely to find support or other people who know how to fix it
[04:17] <joanki> or is it just cause i seem clueless haha
[04:17] <charlie> joanki, You may not know it, but Netscape 9 is actually a pretty good browser. It's based on Firefox, and is much more lightweight than previous Netscape versions.
[04:17] <Jban> Jimd1: Yep
[04:18] <jimmygoon> joanki, some one else answered the right person already :P
[04:18] <wisu> I modified the flash-plugin.deb  post install to download the flash...tar.gz from a local cd... Q: how does the revision of the deb supposed to look like?
[04:18] <Jimd1> jban:  if you did that you would have been prompted for your password.  were you prompted?
[04:18] <scguy318> charlie: well, Firefox is memory heavy :P but god the extensions are the best
[04:18] <jnc> djlenoir: my own experiences with bluetooth and *nix were that it's not user-end ready
[04:18] <joanki> charlie, cool =)
[04:18] <charlie> Netscape 9 also supports firefox extensions
[04:18] <Jban> Jimd1: I did that this time; last time it didnt ask me for it.
[04:18] <don-o> new gutsy fonts++
[04:18] <scguy318> charlie: Opera runs seriously fast, but the plugins suck
[04:18] <Jban> Jimd1: It worked this time around.
[04:18] <jimmygoon> all I know is I'm fed up w/ firefox crashing on me. It seriously pisses me off
[04:18] <Jimd1> jban:  this time you should be able to save it then.
[04:18] <Paxton> I was hoping I'd be typing in this channel from ubuntu, but the disk partition utility on the install CD bugged out :(
[04:19] <pgaucho> Hi.  I need to emulate a vt200 -old but don't seem to have any luck.  Tried with Screen, pterm and xterm but had no luck.  Suggestions?
[04:19] <jnc> wisu: that's more of a developer question methinks
[04:19] <seamus7> firefox with youtube/flash does crash A LOT
[04:19] <charlie> I, myself, use Firefox, and i've tried alot of them. Konqueror = fast but no plugins opera = fast.. that's it firefox= fast & plugins
[04:19] <felipe__> wirechief1: Is it noapic or noacpi?
[04:19] <Jban> Jimd1: Correct, I did not have the knowledge to know that I was supposed to as sudo, that wasnt in the first instructions.
[04:19] <charlie> The only thing that moves me away from anything except firefox is my need for Adblock
[04:19] <Jban> add*
[04:19] <IdleOne> gvsa123: not sure why it isnt showing but you shouldnt be running it as sudo
[04:19] <Dr_willis_> pgaucho,  could try some of the old serial-terminal programs like minicom
[04:19] <Jban> Jimd1: Changes saved.
[04:19] <Jimd1> jban:  that's just a text file in a folder.  easy to edit.  just need permissions to write it.  you should familiarize yourself with it.  when you add more third party sources they'll go there.
[04:19] <m0u5e> so ... anyone can help me with installing gutsy dual booting w/ vista on my dell m1330? do i need to use the alt cd?
[04:19] <Jban> Jimd1: Ok, cool
[04:19] <m0u5e> i'd prefer not to install grub, and instead use EasyBSD
[04:20] <IdleOne> gvsa123: heh cancel that last comment
[04:20] <crazeej> any alsa experts in here... i can't get sound after upgrading to gutsy?
[04:20] <m0u5e> i already have a large enough partition set aside for *buntu
[04:20] <AskHL> nm-applet (the gnome network manager panel applet) never shows any wireless networks in the drop-down menu. Meanwhile, the command "iwlist eth1 scan" will output numerous (correct) ESSIDs of nearby wlans. Isn't nm-applet supposed to show these, and why doesn't it? Any help is appreciated!
[04:20] <seamus7> m0u5e: I use the alt cd in order to have greater partitioning control when setting my dual boot up
[04:20] <charlie> m0u5e, Nope, your best bet would be the standard Live CD
[04:20] <Jban> Jimd1: I understand that concept now.
=== ForeverZero is now known as sea4ever
[04:20] <Jimd1> jban:  after you save it you should launch the synaptic package manager and choose reload
[04:20] <m0u5e> seamus7: will the alt cd allow me not to install grub, and instead allow me to use vista's boot loader to set up my buntu installation?
[04:20] <jnc> AskHL: nm-applet gets info from HAL
[04:21] <charlie> m0u5e, Why don't you want to use GRUB?
[04:21] <m0u5e> charlie: ?
[04:21] <Jimd1> jban:  then search for libdvdcss2
[04:21] <jnc> which uh, needs a driver for your card
[04:21] <marx2k> Uh oh....
[04:21] <koto> why are some programms / apps not found in gnome-app-install but I can install them with aptitude?
[04:21] <marx2k> "Failed to initialize the NVIDIA kernel module!"
[04:21] <m0u5e> charlie: b/c then it would overwrite my vista boot loader, and being that the vista bootloader is fickle, i'd rather not
[04:21] <jnc> AskHL: it's more complicated than I was willing to learn about
[04:21] <djlenoir> jnc: i appreciate the candid advice. i would just go that route but my gaming pc is already set up with wired keyboard and mouse so i need to be able to use this bluetooth keyboard and mouse so that i can stash them out of the way when not in use. i am pretty sure it can work, i am just not experienced enough with *nix to know how to troubleshoot it properly. most of what i have done has been the result of a ton of reading and tinkering.
[04:21] <charlie> It will not overwrite your vista bootloader.
[04:21] <james296> when will there be Ubuntu documentation guides for version 7.10? because they are still only showing for version 7.04 and earlier...
[04:21] <charlie> Like me, with Vista, it creates an entry that chainloads the Vista loder.
[04:21] <charlie> loader*
[04:21] <josh__> Route add default gw on gutsy doesn't work when a static ip is assigned. --No such process-- Anyone seen this?
[04:21] <m0u5e> charlie: ... really? gutsy support this now?
[04:22] <m0u5e> charlie: i remember for feisty, that wasn't the case
[04:22] <charlie> As soon as you pick the "Windows Vista/Longhorn (Loader)" it chinloads the Vista Loader.
[04:22] <seamus7> m0u5e: I use Grub but it does give you options at the end of the installation as to whether to install it in the MBR ... I can't remember if it offers not to install Grub
[04:22] <jnc> djlenoir: I really hope you get it figured out, but that bluetooth stuff was a real pain to pair up and work with when I did a bluetooth GPS device, just not worth the time for me personally
[04:22] <Jban> Jimd1: Doing that now.  I dont see anything that came up for that search "libdvdcss2"
[04:22] <charlie> Well, I just installed Gusty today, fresh install, it was done automatically, with the standard Live CD.
[04:22] <m0u5e> seamus7: was this the alt cd or desktopcd?
[04:22] <m0u5e> charlie: with a vista partition?
[04:22] <AskHL> jnc [and others], I can connect to WEP networks using network-admin. This means something works! But I need to connect to a WPA network, and network-admin supports only WEP ascii/hex keys, not WPA. But according to the WPA howto, nm-applet does! Is it really a driver thing when network-admin shows them correctly?
[04:22] <charlie> Yep.
[04:22] <zhanx> thinking of getting a pcmcia tuner (tv card) or usb for my laptop i so dont have to buy a tv
[04:23] <charlie> I have 3 partitions. 1 Vista partition, 1 ubuntu partition, and 1 swap.
[04:23] <m0u5e> AskHL, nm-applet is standard for ubuntu...
[04:23] <zhanx> problem cant find a supported one listed anywhere
[04:23] <charlie> It was all done automatically.
[04:23] <jnc> AskHL: oh, you've gone and crapped things up
[04:23] <zhanx> !tv-tuner
[04:23] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about tv-tuner - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[04:23] <Colro> Is there a way to temporarily disable xserver-xgl without uninstalling it? I can't find it in sessions when logging on
[04:23] <m0u5e> charlie: and u just used the standard desktop cd?
[04:23] <seamus7> m0u5e: alt ... but I've always used Grub when i dual booted with XP and now with Vista ... works perfectly
[04:23] <charlie> m0u5e, That's what I did.
[04:23] <jnc> AskHL: setting any wireless setting in network-admin will horribly break the nm-applet
[04:23] <m0u5e> seamus7: alright, ill try that out thx
[04:23] <m0u5e> charlie: thx
[04:23] <charlie> m0u5e, No problem. Hope this works out for you too :)

[04:45] <gnomefreak> Jban: you dont need to use the link read exactly what ubotu gave you. it states you can get it from Seveas repo
[04:45] <juancis14> hi
[04:45] <seamus7> Paxton: I resized windows xp once in order to dual boot ... can't remember how i did it ... but on my new laptop I just wiped the hard drive and started from scratch rather than resize any partitions ... good luck
[04:45] <Dan2552> it's a core duo.. i'll have a look at the applet
[04:45] <T7P> I am trying to dual-boot without risking lost data on a separate hard drive. I'd like to install Ubuntu on a drive separate than the drive Windows is on
[04:45] <[[Charlie]]> sorry had to do that, it was tempting.
[04:45] <nrp> Dan2552, you also need to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-applets
[04:45] <Dan2552> nrp: why is that?
[04:46] <Paxton> seamus7: Considering the iffy feeling I'm getting from this info I think it might be best to just stick with wubi until I finish my new machine
[04:46] <RB2> T7P, are you putting it on a seperate drive?
[04:46] <nrp> Dan2552, to be able to change the cpu frequency with that applet.  its a security measure
[04:46] <Jban> gnomefreak: It's confusing I dont know where to start.
[04:46] <Dan2552> nrp: ah, alright
[04:46] <Paxton> seamus7: Any help on my hardware thread would be appreciated too :)
[04:46] <fxfitz> Hi there. I have a HP PSC-2715 and I'm trying to use its scanner with xsane. It USED to work, but now whenever I try to select the device to scan from, the program just freezes.
[04:46] <fxfitz> Can anyone help??
[04:46] <|||BOX|||> I installed 2 hdds one for me old XP pro and new one for this ubuntu works a treat i can pull any media file off my xp drive and  it plays on  ubuntu
[04:46] <gnomefreak> Jban: go to http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages and look for it than install it
[04:47] <T7P> RB2: Yes, but this drive has files on it that I'd like to keep. I want to partition the [80 GB] drive so that 50 GB goes to Windows and 30 GB  goes to Ubuntu
[04:47]  * [[Charlie]] is away: brb
[04:47] <Jban> gnomefreak: ok
[04:47] <seamus7> Paxton: hardware thread?
[04:47] <eck0> vlet: http://pastebin.com/m206198b4
[04:47] <|||BOX|||> YAY got Utorrent working :)
[04:47] <eck0> vlet: I also tried using the nv driver but it wouldn't work
[04:47] <eck0> for some odd reason :s
[04:48] <Paxton> seamus7: Yeah, need suggestions for my machine-to-be: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=562506
[04:48] <fxfitz> Can anyone help? I can't even find an error to check?
[04:48] <nomad111> hey all does anyone have a logitech mx or vx revolution mouse
[04:48] <Dan2552> darn. The lowest this thing will let me go to is 1ghz.. :p not slow enough
[04:48] <Jban> gnomefreak: So I just click on a mirror and nothing happens, do I have to add them?
[04:49] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552, are you trying to save battery?
[04:49] <Dan2552> [[charlie]]: yes
[04:49] <XsteelWolf> How do i burn an iso virtually
[04:49] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552, How much battery life do you get on a full charge without scaling the CPU?
[04:49] <Dan2552> XsteelWolf: do you mean mount an ISO as a virtual drive?
[04:49] <XsteelWolf> Dan2552, yes
[04:49] <Dan2552> [[Charlie]]: 1 hour, 20 mins
[04:49] <nomad111> i think he means like daemon tools
[04:49] <nomad111> for linux
[04:50] <|||BOX|||> cool got mirc working also im on a roll
[04:50] <nomad111> equivalent
[04:50] <Dan2552> you can mount in terminal with mount command
[04:50] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552, Wow... I get more than 3 hours on full CPU ~2 ghz
[04:50] <LiMaO> XsteelWolf: sudo mount isoname /destination -o loop
[04:50] <XsteelWolf> Actually all i need is that i can burn the ISO to my hdd.
[04:50] <Dan2552> [[Charlie]]: it's a powerfull laptop
[04:50] <|||BOX|||> went to mount iso but soon as i click on it  ubuntu asks if i wann mount :) this is too easy
[04:50] <eck0> Vlet: did you manage to see my conf?
[04:50] <gnomefreak> Jban: what version of ubuntu?
[04:50] <CunningLinguist> mount -t iso9660 file.iso /mnt -o loop
[04:51] <heartsblood> is it possible to use ls to list only hidden file types?
[04:51] <LiMaO> heartsblood: ls -a
[04:51] <Jban> gnomefreak: 7.10
[04:51] <gnomefreak> LiMaO: that isnt what he asked
[04:51] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552, Still seems like you should get a little more at least. My laptop is about 1.9 ghz for some reason and I get great battery life. What make/model do you have?
[04:51] <LiMaO> heartsblood: it'll list all files, including hidden
[04:51] <|||BOX|||> do i have to use terminal to mount me bin file?
[04:51] <nekostar> argh
[04:51] <b4sic> fedora ftw?
[04:51] <b4sic> lawlz.
[04:51] <heartsblood> LiMaO: that's not what I asked.
[04:51] <Name141> how do you fix the C compiler not being able to make executables ?
[04:52] <mikeo2> anyone have the problem of azureus constantly crashing after an upgrade
[04:52] <Dan2552> [[Charlie]]: it's from www.novatech.co.uk - a small UK business, and the 17 inch widescreeen and radeon graphics surely doesn't help with battery
[04:52] <Paxton> isn't ls -h to show hidden? I can barely remember console stuff :p
[04:52] <mikeo2> it opens and crashes instantly
[04:52] <Berzerker> how do I make a jar execute by double clicking on it?
[04:52] <|||BOX|||>  do i have to use terminal to mount me bin file? anyone
[04:52] <jimmygoon> Name141, What are you talking about?
[04:52] <Jban> gnomefreak: 7.10
[04:52] <gnomefreak> heartsblood: no ther eisnt afaik please man ls for more details
[04:52] <LiMaO> gnomefreak: helping to many people at the same time, in different places.. take some time to spot some different questions =P
[04:52] <RB2> T7P, sorry, was away. So, you're going to install it on a separate drive, but you want to partition the existing one?
[04:52] <gnomefreak> Jban: hold on a minute
[04:52] <[[Charlie]]> Ah, that would do it. My screen is only 15.4"
[04:52] <Jban> ok
[04:52] <rb007> I've downloaded Gibbon.  The md5 is OK.  I've tried burning it to CD five times, but each time I have the CD check itself (after booting the live CD) it tells me there are between 1 and 24 errors on each disk.  I've burned both from Feisty and from Windows XP.  Any ideas?
[04:52] <gnomefreak> LiMaO: i know the feeling
[04:52] <LiMaO> heartsblood: i'll give you your answer in a second
[04:52] <Name141> jimmygoon, configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[04:53] <jimmygoon> Name141, try "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
[04:53] <gnomefreak> Jban: http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/free/libd/libdvdcss/   fild the one for you and install it.
[04:53] <gnomefreak> Name141: you have build-essential installed?
[04:53] <heartsblood> gnomefreak: I did, I'm just wondering if I can make a script that will parse the files from ls and only print .Fubar.  Just not sure how to format it
[04:53] <|||BOX|||> whats the eqivalant to convertxtodvd for linux
[04:53] <[[Charlie]]> rb007, Your disks or Burner may be messed up.
[04:53] <Name141> Doesn't look like it
[04:53] <jimmygoon> Name141, instal it
[04:53] <gnomefreak> Name141: install it :)
[04:53] <bbrazil> rb007: you either have bad cds, or a bad reader/writer
[04:53] <Jban> gnomefreak: How do I know which one is for me?
[04:53] <[[Charlie]]> sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++
[04:54] <XiXaQ> Has anyone here been able to use gnucash for anything? I can't seem to get it right, even when I follow the manual to the letter.
[04:54] <woohoo> i installed gutsy with /home set to a existing partition with existing directories... now i cant log into ubuntu! it says refusing to initialise GTK|+ cant save users-dirs.dir
[04:54] <inter4ever> can someone tell me from where i can download the final ubuntu 7.10 dvds?
[04:54] <rb007> Is there a Web-based installer so I don't have to install from a live CD?
[04:54] <inter4ever> can't seem to find them on the site
[04:54] <gnomefreak> Jban: fine what arch are you using?
[04:54] <T7P> RB2: That is correct. Windows is on IDE:1 (C:\), and I want Ubuntu on IDE:2 (F:\). However, through Windows, I have all my programs, games, and music on IDE:2 (F:\) which I do not want to lose.
[04:54] <Dan2552> has anyone got any links to tutorials on how to make windowborder themes which work with the default ubuntu stuffs (metacity? i think?)
[04:54] <roast> woohoo: it's probably because the uid's don't match.
[04:54] <jimmygoon> !download || inter4ever
[04:54] <|||BOX|||> inter4ever:  google is your friend
[04:54] <ubotu> | inter4ever: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive - PLEASE use the !torrents to download Gutsy, and help keeping the servers' load low!
[04:54] <Jban> gnomefreak: I dont know what an arch is.
[04:54] <LiMaO> heartsblood: you may want to use find... sudo find / -name ".*"
[04:54] <gnomefreak> Jban: i386 or 64bit or ppc or what
[04:54] <woohoo> roast: wat can i do
[04:54] <Berzerker> what's the newest java package
[04:54] <LiMaO> that will list all files starting with . in the directory /
[04:54] <Berzerker> to install
[04:54] <[[Charlie]]> !torrents | inter4ever
[04:54] <ubotu> inter4ever: Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Gutsy: http://fr.releases.ubuntu.com/gutsy/ (CDs) or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/7.10/release/ (DVDs) - Please download using the torrents if you can!
[04:54] <jimmygoon> rb007, there is an alt disc, but w/e could you mean?
[04:54] <gnomefreak> Berzerker: 6
[04:54] <eck0> Can someone help me with my dual monitor issues? :<
[04:54] <roast> woohoo: how many homedirs are in /home
[04:54] <Berzerker> but what exactly is it
[04:54] <Jban> Dell_XP2_Gen2 laptop
[04:54] <roast> woohoo: ?
[04:54] <heartsblood> LiMaO: ah that might work ty.
[04:55] <Jban> I guess that's x86 ?
[04:55] <Berzerker> the package name
[04:55] <LordLimecat> is there any particular reason pidgin under gutsy is buggy as hell -_-
[04:55] <woohoo> roast: 3
[04:55] <LiMaO> heartsblood: you're welcome
[04:55] <[[Charlie]]> eck0: sure. gusty?
[04:55] <eck0> yeah [[Charlie]]
[04:55] <LordC> eck0 what is the issue?
[04:55] <LordLimecat> to the point i cannot switch pidgin tabs
[04:55] <eck0> Okay
[04:55] <eck0> I have a nvidia 6600gt
[04:55] <roast> woohoo: just `chown -R the_username /home/the_username` for each dir
[04:55] <CITguy> can anybody help me get my borders back when turning on desktop effects?
[04:55] <RB2> T7P, Ubuntu will re-size the Windows partition for you. But, as always, be sure to make a backup just in case.
[04:55] <gnomefreak> sun-java6-plugin use apt-cache policy packagename as i gave you to list version numbers
[04:55] <Dan2552> LordLimecat: my pidgin is working fine
[04:55] <[[Charlie]]> ok you can just say "charlie" some idiot registered "Charlie" before me :P
[04:55] <eck0> the default driver is vesa?
[04:55] <Name141> one other thing, is it possible to stop all this diddly oogly animations ?
[04:55] <rb007> jimmygoon: I think it's Debian that has a web-based installer -- downloads everything from the web and installs it on the fly.  The initial file is small.
[04:55] <mboso>  when I upgraded from edgy to fiesty I got a kernel panic because of
[04:55] <inter4ever> ubotu i already got the cds, i would like to get the dvds that combine the alternate and desktop cds and more packages like they did in feisty or are they not released yet?
[04:55] <mboso>          the UUID label from grub. What do I need to do to get my kernel to
[04:55] <Name141> Reminds me of how XP slowed down
[04:55] <LordLimecat> Dan2552: when i /join #channel, then click the channel name, 1/2 the time the tab closes, 1/2 the time it doesnt switch
[04:55] <LordLimecat> fresh gutsy install
[04:55] <Jban> gnomefreak: Is x86 the same as i386?
[04:55] <LordC> eck0: Do you not want to use the Restricted nvidia drivers that come with Gutsy?
[04:56] <[[Charlie]]> eck0: Have you tried going to System > Administration > Screens and Graphics?
[04:56] <gnomefreak> Jban: that depends on the proc but here ill giv eyou the link
[04:56] <jimmygoon> rb007, do you mean they boot from a disc that does a net-install or the windows based install?
=== |||BOX||| is now known as BOX|UK
[04:56] <Dan2552> LordLimecat: hmm, I don't know about IRC - I'm using Opera for IRC
[04:56] <juancis14> t7p: leave the ubuntuinstaller to resize partition size
[04:56] <usr13> What is the command to show Ubuntu install version number?
[04:56] <eck0> Yes I have - and LordC I want to use the correct drivers
[04:56] <gnomefreak> Jban: http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/free/libd/libdvdcss/libdvdcss2_1.2.9-2medibuntu2%2bb1_i386.deb
[04:56] <jimmygoon> cause there is a windows-based-install for ubuntu I believe -- can't rmemeber the project name though
[04:56] <LordLimecat> Dan2552: well, i know pidgin under fiesty worked
[04:56] <tritium> usr13: lsb_release -a
[04:56] <usr13> tritium: thank you
[04:56] <LordLimecat> gutsy seems to be polished, but less stable than fiesty :\
[04:56] <T7P> RB2: When I get to the partition screen, which option should I choose? (Guided - Use Entire Disk; Guided - Uses largest continuous free space; Manual)
[04:56] <rb007> jimmygoon: I did it once.  I can't remember the exact procedure.  The initial file was very small and it downloaded the files it needed as it installed it.
[04:56] <[[Charlie]]> eck0, what graphics card
[04:56] <riotkittie> jimmygoon: wubi
[04:56] <Jban> gnomefreak: ok
[04:56] <LordC> eck0: What do you mean by correct?
[04:56] <rb007> jimmygoon: I think it was debian stable
[04:56] <riotkittie> oh wait thats ubuntu
[04:56] <Dan2552> LordLimecat: well this is my 1st real try on ubuntu anyway
[04:56] <riotkittie> yer talking debian, eh.
[04:56] <eck0> uh god, [[Charlie]] and Lordc I'll get back to you after I install the correct driver lol I am so noob,
[04:57] <gnomefreak> Jban: i suggest you read what is given to you next time as i can tell you didnt read it or you just skimmed it
[04:57] <BOX|UK> got utorrent working on ubuntu but the main window is black :(
[04:57] <[[Charlie]]> :P
[04:57] <LordC> =] Sure
[04:57] <Berzerker> gnomefreak: what's the package name?
[04:57] <gnomefreak> Berzerker: i gave it to you
[04:57] <gnomefreak> Berzerker: sun-java6-plugin
[04:57] <gnomefreak> did you think i was kidding?
[04:57] <inter4ever> yes that's normal BOX|UK
[04:57] <LordLimecat> Dan2552: maybe its xorg
[04:57] <Jban> gnomefreak: I am reading everything you give me.
[04:57] <RB2> T7P, I thought there was a re-size option. Does anyone else have advice for T7P?
[04:57] <yigal> does anyone know anything about using a custom dtst for a laptop?
[04:57] <inter4ever> so doesnt any one have any idea about gutsy dvds?
[04:57] <Berzerker> I didn't think you were kidding
[04:57] <Vlet> eck0: sorry, had to go afk. Try replacing your device section with this.. http://pastebin.com/m625b1d50
[04:58] <Berzerker> it's kind hard to see it though...
[04:58] <LordC> Isn't uTorrent Windows only? Why not use Azureus?
[04:58] <BOX|UK> thxs inter4ever
[04:58] <Dan2552> LordLimecat: no idea :)
[04:58] <Vlet> eck0: back up your xorg.conf first
[04:58] <Berzerker> ever think people don't see what you type?
[04:58] <noor> guys know where i can give my ubuntu some soul by adding some sound files? gnome-look.org lacks them :(
[04:58] <Jban> gnomefreak: I responded to your question by telling you I thought it was x86 and was that teh same as the other 86
[04:58] <Dan2552> LordC: I'm from windows and found utorrent to be a lot faster than the others
[04:58] <juancis14> lordc: yup, utorrent is windows only, but u can use it wth wine
[04:58] <LordC> Ah, okay
[04:58] <RB2> T7P, Sorry, I did a fresh install on a blank drive and don't have a spare machine readily avail. to check it on.
[04:58] <Vlet> Berzerker: there's so many people asking, and so few people here answering
[04:59] <BOX|UK> i like utorrent so i wanted a challenge to see if i could make it run on ubuntu  ....only installed ubuntu today and im loving it
[04:59] <Name141> is it possible to apt get-install the purple plugin pack for Pidgin ?
[04:59] <Jban> gnomefreak: Now should I try to play it with which program? TOtem or VLC?
[04:59] <alain> ei guys.. is it possible to make a vhost on my box even if im running on a dynamic ip
[04:59] <LordC> Great, welcome to the community then BOX|UK :)
[04:59] <jimmygoon> rb007, wubi, according to riotkittie
[04:59] <Vlet> BOX|UK: yeah, it can be done with wine - many people do, but why not try Azureus or Deluge first?
[04:59] <gnomefreak> Jban: READ THE restricted link i gave you or /msg ubotu restricted and read it
[04:59] <BOX|UK> im finding the freedom a little scary  but the learning curve is great
[05:00] <alain> !vhost
[05:00] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vhost - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:00] <jimmygoon> rb007, http://wubi-installer.org/
[05:00] <T7P> RB2: It's okay. Thanks for trying. You wouldn't happen to know anywhere to find a tutorial for the manual partitioner, would you? I'm having no luck looking through the documentation
[05:00] <BOX|UK> Vlet:  ive got deluge running installed it through synaptic
[05:00] <rb007> jimmygoon: ok, thanks... I will look into that
[05:00] <Dan2552> oooh. I have another question - can i setup my laptop as a softAP so I can connect to it with my Nintendo DS through wireless and access internet?
[05:00] <LordC> BOX|UK: Yeah, once the learning curve becomes less steep, you might find yourself doing crazy challenges just so you don't get bored ;p
[05:00] <Jban> gnomefreak: My problem is that you already know everything about everything and I am juggling 4 different links, so forgive me for not being an expert.
[05:00] <LordLimecat> does anyone know how to underclock an nvidia card?
[05:00] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552: Do you steal your neighbors wifi? :P
[05:01] <J-_> does the epiphany delicious extension have an option to put in the sidebar?
[05:01] <LordC> Lol, it's not stealing, it's "putting to good use" [[Charlie]]
[05:01] <BOX|UK> lord i just downloaded a linux bible pdf  gonna   read and practice
[05:01] <Dan2552> [[Charlie]]: I'm the only person around with wifi, but i'd like to enable WPA but DS doesn't support it
[05:01] <[[Charlie]]> Dan2552, Although I know it's possible on windows (been there done that) i don't know if it's possible on Linux.
[05:01] <Black-Hand> I have wifi...
[05:01] <gnomefreak> Jban: i am working it is exactly midnight and i should be sleeping but i have to get the work done, im sorry but i can not hold your hand through it
[05:01] <Dan2552> i mean locally...
[05:01] <LordC> Dan2552: Oh, I feel your pain. My DS doesn't go online, for this very reason
[05:01] <l3rutalforce> Question about using sleep mode
[05:01] <dystopianray> Dan2552: you can do it if you have a wifi card that supports AP mode
[05:01]  * [[Charlie]] is back (gone 00:14:39)
[05:01] <LordC> Dan2552: Only allowing WEP was a stupid mistake on Ninendo's behalf
[05:02] <[[Charlie]]> Yeah
[05:02] <inter4ever> i have two questions, before upgrading from feisty to gutsy X64, first where do I get vmware server isntalled easily like it did in feisty, i can't find it in the partners repository?
[05:02] <Paxton> seamus7: I'm gonna use wubi and just make sure everything's hunky dory in Gutsy. Hopefully I'll be back in this channel on it shortly :)
[05:02] <[[Charlie]]> I just have an unsecured access point.
[05:02] <hrp2171> l3rutalforce, hi

[05:02] <seamus7> Paxton: good luck
[05:02] <l3rutalforce> Does it power down the network and stops running hard drive?
[05:02] <l3rutalforce> Question about using sleep mode: Does it power down the network and stops running hard drive?
[05:02] <drewby> is there a mental health irc channel?
[05:02] <[[Charlie]]> It's nice to think people think you're the idiot with the unsecured access point with the default "linksys" SSID :p
[05:02] <juancis14> somebody knows how to get debbuger suport for free pascal instaled form deb packages?
[05:02] <drewby> I really need to talk to someone
[05:02] <[[Charlie]]> gnomefreak, What if I don't want to?

[05:02] <luislo> Hi guys... my gnome desktop appeared a bit strange... the bar at the bottom doesn't fit the whole width of the screen and it's on really on the bottom, but off by 1cm above... how can I fix this?
[05:02] <hrp2171> l3rutalforce, sleep mode yes
[05:02] <gnomefreak> [[Charlie]]: dont try it
[05:02] <eck0> lol drewby?
[05:02] <atouk> is it possible to print to an hp printer through XP printer sharing
[05:03] <inter4ever> second how do  iget wine to run on it,it's not in the repositories again even though the 64bit version was on winehq repository for feisty since long time ago
[05:03] <gnomefreak> !away | [[Charlie]]
[05:03] <ubotu> [[Charlie]]: You should avoid changing your nick in a busy channel like #ubuntu - it causes unrequired scrolling which is unfair on new users. The same goes for using noisy away messages : use the command "/away <reason>" to set your client away silently - See also !Guidelines
[05:03] <kousotu> also need a webcan driver for Logitech uicam Zoom
[05:03] <hrp2171> l3rutalforce, suspend it keeps some things juiced with minimal power

[05:03] <Jban> gnomefreak: That's fine, I wasn't asking you to hold my hand--you offered to help me if you remember, and I am just accepting it.  You shouldn't have to feel as if you are holding someone's hand, and I'm certainly didnt mean to make you come down from your Mount Olympus.
[05:03] <[[Charlie]]> Yep, but my client automatically sends out away messages when i do a /away.
[05:03] <jimmygoon> (is it not possible to turn off join/part/away's in your client :S
[05:03] <gnomefreak> [[Charlie]]: turn it off
[05:03] <l3rutalforce> hrp2171 but does it close down the internet (like downloads)?
[05:03] <jimmygoon> (like seeing them that is)

[05:03] <jumbers> How can I disable Xgl in Gutsy Gibbon? My notebook can't handle it
[05:04] <hrp2171> l3rutalforce, hibernate kind of saves state machine to a file on the hard drive
[05:04] <iobelisk> i just installed sabayon linux on a free parition (am using Ubuntu as my main OS) and i edited menu.lst in the boot folder to relfect ubuntu's menu.lst. on a reboot GRUB shows ubuntu, it starts loading, the splash screen comes, the load bar goes upto half and then the splash disappears and a cursor blinks at the top left hand corner of the otherwise blank screen, i keep waiting for something to happen but nothing does. what do you think? r
[05:04] <CarlF1> how do I disable compiz?  (wine faq recommendation )
[05:04] <[[Charlie]]> If it's really that irritating to have one  away message in a period of 15 minutes, even though more scrolling happens by constant joins/parts, fine, i'll turn it off.

[05:05] <Reng> anyone getting this error in dmesg "ACPI Exception (processor_core-0783): AE_NOT_FOUND, Processor Device is not present"
[05:05] <josenj76> Did anyone did a fresh install of 7.10 and have problems with apt-get?
[05:05] <CarlF1> juancis14: thanks
[05:05] <caner> has anybody been able to solve the gutsy - nvidia-glx-driver problem. i am still using the driver which came out of the box and it killing me?
[05:05] <scguy318> josenj76: i did a fresh, but no to the latter, whats the issue
[05:05] <matelot> wow busy here haha
[05:05] <Dekkard> this reminds me of the update to feisty..
[05:05] <hrp2171> which packages should i install for learning c programming? thanks.
[05:05] <[[Charlie]]> That's #ubuntu for you scguy318 :p
[05:05] <LordC> yeah matelot lol
[05:05] <Dan2552> josenj76: i did the 1st time i installed (i didnt have an internet connection while installing...)
[05:05] <dystopianray> Reng: I have a similar message which can be safely ignored, I imagine the same is true for yours too
[05:05] <jumbers> Dan2552: In the Visual Effects tab, it's set to None, but the Xgl process is running
[05:06] <Cpudan80> hrp2171: The developer ones, gcc, ddd, gdb
[05:06] <seamus7> jumbers: I suppose you could just remove it .. sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl
[05:06] <Cpudan80> Cpudan80: and make
[05:06] <dystopianray> hrp2171: build-essential and manpages-dev
[05:06] <juancis14> hrp2171 to learn c programming dont need any packages, just a book :)
[05:06] <matelot> wholey shit...
[05:06] <TECH_1> Doed )Gnash) come in 7.04.
[05:06] <jimmygoon> hrp2171, the book is more important than the ide/program
[05:06] <Dan2552> jumbers: that's odd. Try switching to a driver that simply cant support it? :p that'll get it for sure
[05:06] <TECH_1> does
[05:06] <caner> <[[Charlie]]> i dont think you have to install any package. there is already a c compiler in every linux system.
[05:06] <Cpudan80> and I agree
[05:06] <matelot> anuone in China here ?
[05:06] <Cpudan80> Write your C programs in vim or gedit
[05:06] <Madpilot> matelot, language, please - and this is slightly busier than usual, but not bad.
[05:06] <jimmygoon> hrp2171, try ##C++ and ##C++-social . they can seem mean at first but they are very helpful
[05:06] <[[Charlie]]> I did not say that.
[05:06] <iobelisk> just installed sabayon, edited the GRUB menu.lst to reflect the Ubuntu settings, on reboot the ubuntu splash screen comes up, when the load bar reaches about half, the splash disappears, and a cursor blinks at the top left corner of the screen. do i need to reinstall linux or is there a way around this?
[05:06] <hrp2171> well, cause i tried compiling something and it told me that stdio.h did not exists
[05:06] <Cpudan80> None of this IDE stuff
[05:06] <caner> <[[Charlie]]> just a text editor is enough
[05:06] <DShepherd> My gdm doesnt want to start. I get this message .."your greeter application appears to be crashing attempting to use a different one". Does anyone know how to fix this?
[05:06] <kousotu> anyone know any aplications thatI can use for webcams to recotrd video?
[05:06] <kousotu> also need a webcan driver for Logitech uicam Zoom
[05:06] <dystopianray> hrp2171: you need build-essential
[05:06] <Cpudan80> hrp2171: ##C is good too
[05:07] <[[Charlie]]> What the hell caner? I didn't say ANY of that.
[05:07] <hrp2171> dystopianray, thanks
[05:07] <BOX|UK> i installed firestarter   but id like to learn how to create me own ip tables   and  stuff  it can be done in terminal right and  ill have to turn firestarter off?
[05:07] <epidodi> Hi all - I'm in gutsy and I have a process call XRDB that appears 15 times as a zombie. Does anyone know what causes this and if it is normal? I'm pretty new
[05:07] <luislo> Hi guys... my gnome desktop appeared a bit strange... the bar at the bottom doesn't fit the whole width of the screen and it's on really on the bottom, but off by 1cm above... how can I fix this?
[05:07] <Super> hrp2171: install build-essentials
[05:07] <Ertai88> Question about ShipIt - Why do they need your phone number?
[05:07] <caner> <[[Charlie]]> you said what?
[05:07] <[[Charlie]]> !language | [[Charlie]]
[05:07] <jimmygoon> Cpudan80, good point... I see 'C' and respond with 'c++' advice ... woops :P
[05:07] <dystopianray> hrp2171: install manpages-dev too then you will have man pages for system call and library call
[05:07] <woohoo> hi.. when i try to enable the nvidia driver it says 'the software source for this package is not enabled nvidia-glx-new' wat cani do?
[05:07] <riotkittie> build-essential. no s, Super
[05:07] <gnomefreak> caner: you would need to install build-essential for C compiler
[05:07] <[[Charlie]]> caner: i don't know what you're doing here but stop.
[05:07] <hrp2171> cool! thanks guys
[05:07] <juancis14> also u need gcc to compile what u write
[05:07] <Scabdates> i'm getting no sound. i have a cmi 8738, any idea what might be wrong/what i should do? i'm using gutsy gibbon
[05:07] <Cpudan80> jimmygoon: lol
[05:07] <whyameye> anybody know where I can find acpi_sbs module? I'm getting an error that it is not found when I try to hibernate
[05:07] <Dan2552> Ertai88: i put in my phone number and havn't been rang
[05:07] <[[Charlie]]> Cpudan80
[05:07] <hrp2171> gcc is already installed
[05:07] <Madpilot> Ertai88, likely for the customs people - but I'm guessing
[05:07] <josenj76> scguy318, I did a fresh install of 7.10 and for many of the packages I tried to install I get "Broken packages" errors.  For example, wine wanted libaudio so I apt-get install libaudio and "Broken package".  I then copied the /etc/apt/sources.list file from the cd to my HD and libaudio finally install but I noticed in the source.list file that I have references to feisty
[05:08] <[[Charlie]]> I'm speaker219, remember me? Are you like in every channel I go to :P
[05:08] <Cpudan80> [[Charlie]]: Yes ?
[05:08] <Cpudan80> oh hello
[05:08] <[[Charlie]]> Hey :p
[05:08] <juancis14> the u can compile from a terminal
[05:08] <gnomefreak> [[Charlie]]: stay on topic
[05:08] <[[Charlie]]> Oh god...
[05:08] <[[Charlie]]> My bad
[05:08] <caner> <gnomefreak> yes youre right sorry
[05:08] <josenj76> Should I have installed 7.04 first then 7.10?
[05:08] <crdlb> !components | woohoo, you need the restricted component
[05:08] <ubotu> woohoo, you need the restricted component: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[05:08] <hrp2171> yep, will be starting at the command line.
[05:08] <iobelisk> just installed sabayon, edited the GRUB menu.lst to reflect the Ubuntu settings, on reboot the ubuntu splash screen comes up, when the load bar reaches about half, the splash disappears, and a cursor blinks at the top left corner of the screen. do i need to reinstall linux or is there a way around this?
[05:08] <zyxnull> woohoo : Enable "propietary drivers for devices" on the "software sources"
[05:08] <juancis14> josenj76 u can do that or install gusty directly
[05:08] <caner> <[[Charlie]]> i didnt wnat to get you angry , sorry
[05:08] <riotkittie> josenj76: no. not for a clean install [which is what you said you did, right?]
[05:09] <[[Charlie]]> caner: If you really don't want to be angry, stop doing it ;)
[05:09] <josenj76> Yes riotkittie
[05:09] <rayb0t> Can someone please tell me what the purpose of the "Clone Selection" plugin for Compiz is? I don't get it. :/
[05:09] <matelot> exit
[05:09] <epidodi> Hi all - I'm in gutsy and I have a process call XRDB that appears 15 times as a zombie. Does anyone know what causes this and if it is normal? I'm pretty new
[05:09] <woohoo> zyxnull: where do i find that
[05:09] <Madpilot> rayb0t, the whole purpose of compiz is to look shiny and eat resources. :)
[05:09] <josenj76> but I have problems with my source.list file in Gutsy.  Wine, for example woun't install, I get "Broken package" and it's like that for other packages that I want to install
[05:09] <nickrud> lol
[05:09] <Scabdates> i just installed gutsy gibbon. i don't get any sound. my soundcard is a cmi 8738. any ideas on how to fix this?
[05:09] <Vlet> hrp2171: try anjuta
[05:09] <rayb0t> Madpilot: I have plenty of resources :P might as well use them
[05:10] <zyxnull> woohoo: System > Administration > Software sources
[05:10] <rayb0t> all I do is listen to music and chat really, why not :)
[05:10] <riotkittie> Scabdates: do you have onboard sound and a card?
[05:10] <seamus7> kousotu: check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam
[05:10] <juancis14> madpilot, compiz doesnt eat any resources, i use it with on 64 vram and 256 ram
[05:10] <woohoo> zyxnull: ok thnx
[05:10] <jimmygoon> fscking gutsy just did it again... screen goes black like screensaver or something and then doesn't respond
[05:10] <zyxnull> woohoo: you welcome
[05:10] <jimmygoon> have to ctrl=alt=backspace to relogin :S this is getting old
[05:10] <Dan2552> josenj76: try reinstalling with it connected to the internet while its installing. I don't know if its related but thats the only difference i had when i reinstalled and it just worked
[05:10] <Scabdates> riotkittie: no, just a card
[05:11] <Ertai88> Sweet. I've also got a problem with my wireless dongle - DWL-G122 rev A2, which uses the prism54usb driver that ships with 7.10. It connects fine, but the signal gets lost 5 minutes later. Help?
[05:11] <mattg> WOOT!  7.10 is workin good now :)
[05:11] <josenj76> Dan2552, did you reinstall Gutsy?
[05:11] <robert_> has anybody here successfully compiled generator under amd64 before?
[05:11] <secret901> is there a way to revert back to Fiesty after an "update" to Gutsy? Gutsy is breaking a lot of stuff that was previously supported.
[05:11] <Dan2552> josenj76: 7.10, yes
[05:11] <pupster> Howdy, im trying to install a program (MX5000Tools) and it requires glib-2.0 .. and cant find it, im pretty sure it is because the library is called libglib-2.0-0, I was wondering if anyone might know how I can get around this
[05:11] <jumbers> Whoever suggested I remove xserver-xgl, thank you, now it's not unbelievably choppy like it was before
[05:11] <josenj76> Dan2552, did you have problems with packages too?
[05:11] <Vlet> secret901: no, you'd have to reinstall
[05:11] <seamus7> secret901: I believe you would need to do a fresh install of 7.04
[05:11] <riotkittie> secret901: no. you cannot downgrade. if you want feisty back, you've got to go with a fresh install
[05:11] <_tux> Question: is it possible to add a shortcut key to one of the terminals in Gnome? rather than having to click the icon every second
[05:12] <Dan2552> josenj76: first time I installed I did
[05:12] <zyxnull> pupster: Why you don't ln that file?
[05:12] <caner> is there anybody using geforce go 7200 here? and if yes can you use it with gutsy and nvidia-glx-new driver without any problem?
[05:12] <secret901> Vlet, semus7, riotkittie: can I save my settings?
[05:12] <josenj76> Dan2552, what type of problems did you find yourself in, if you don't mind me asking....
[05:12] <pupster> zyxnull, I dontk now where to link the file too ..
[05:12] <LM22> AHHHHHH!!!
[05:12] <Jamesinator> I have ettercap running and passing all traffic in my home network into my local box, how can I analyze how much bandwidth individual IPs on the network are using?
[05:12] <LM22> LOL
[05:12] <Scabdates> riotkittie: my hardware is quite old, so i had to buy a soundcard instead of using onboard. i've heard that linux supports CMI cards pretty good, so i dunno
[05:13] <Ertai88> _tux: System -> Admin -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Looks for open a terminal window
[05:13] <LM22> Does anyone here use nautilus-actions?
[05:13] <Vlet> secret901: settigns for what?
[05:13] <DVS01> i have a dedicated server at a datacenter, and it has a bunch of ips. i want to be able to bind to one of those ips on my home machine and be able to reach that interface through that ip. how would i set this up? i'm guessing i'd need openvpn for this
[05:13] <Dan2552> josenj76: can't recall exactly, but im sure apt-get and the add/remove things couldnt find dependancies or anything
[05:13] <riotkittie> secret901: if home's on a seperate partition, you're all good. otherwise, copy it to another drive...
[05:13] <hrp2171> installing glibc-doc as suggested by the manpages-dev package
[05:13] <juancis14> caner: try with nvidia-glx and if doesnt work try with te new one
[05:13] <seamus7> _tux: you can go into Keyboard Shortcuts on the System/Preferences menu and set one up for a terminal .. I have mine set to F4
[05:13] <IpMoo> Scabdates,   m-audio..
[05:13] <jimmygoon> Dan2552, may have been a problem with the ubunut mirrors being flaky due to traffic
[05:13] <zyxnull> pupster: Do you know the exact file you need?
[05:13] <caner> i think they both get the same package
[05:13] <Scabdates> IpMoo: hm?
[05:13] <caner> <juancis14> i think they both get the same package
[05:13] <flodine> anyone try E17 on gutsy yet?
[05:13] <mattg> props to those at ubuntu!  thank ya much!
[05:14] <_tux> I gotcha
[05:14] <Dan2552> jimmygoon: that does make some sense
[05:14] <Madpilot> `eric-, there you go
[05:14] <secret901> I find Gutsy not able to resume from a suspend and the wireless card not connecting
[05:14] <IpMoo> Scabdates,   for pro audio  www.m-audio.com
[05:14] <_tux> cause I am sick of having to click the icon every second
[05:14] <josenj76> jimmygoon, I had the same problems as Dan2552.......
[05:14] <eck0> Hm, I got dual monitors going nice now :) - second problem visual effects - see: http://pastebin.com/m300fe788
[05:14] <_tux> thanks guys
[05:14] <Jamesinator> I have ettercap running and passing all traffic in my home network into my local box, how can I analyze how much bandwidth individual IPs on the network are using?
[05:14] <juancis14> i'm not sure of that, only installed nvidia-glx...

[05:15] <Motoko-chan> Hello. I'm having a problem with Eclipse on Kubuntu.
[05:15] <phrost> how do you prevent the installer from loading a module, what's the command line argument, module.blacklist or something?

[05:15] <Scabdates> im not using onboard IpMoo
[05:15] <Motoko-chan> It was working on 7.04, but isn't on 7.10 now.
[05:15] <hrp2171> awesome!  compiled my first c program! Woohoo!
[05:15] <josenj76> Does anyone know why booting into the live CD of gutsy has "feisty" references in the source.list file?
[05:15] <Motoko-chan> Any known issues?

[05:16] <derrrface> has any1 been able to get the VEG -N- RTV (USB) to work w/ ubuntu?
[05:16] <pupster> zyxnull: yea, I tried linking it, didn't work .. i think because its not reconizing it as a package ..

[05:16] <riotkittie> _tux: did you enable cube rotate plugin?
[05:16] <Dekkard> you change desktops
[05:17] <josenj76> Dan2552, that's ok... I'll try anything at this point....  I know my source.list is messed up
[05:17] <seamus7> then go to the Advanced Desktop Effects Settings in System/Preferences and enable the Desktop Cube and Rotate ... you can set the scroll wheel of your mouse to activate it if you also enable Viewport Switcher

[05:22] <KevinO> anyone care to help me get my internet working again?
[05:22] <seamus7> Kevin0: it can be tricky if you don't make sure to apply the new static configuration ... restart networking in a terminal " sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart "  ... etc.
[05:22] <youknowme> gouranga
[05:22] <IpMoo> Dan2552,   il help u...  7.10 is  awsom

[05:22] <Vlet> !ask | KevinO
[05:22] <ubotu> KevinO: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:22] <MidnighToker> elninja: press [ctrl]+F1, but its rubbish, use the fallback kernel from the bootmenu
[05:22] <josenj76> Does anyone know where I can get a copy of a "good" sources.list file?
[05:22] <epidodi> Does anyone know why I would have the process XRDB running about 15 times as a zombie in Gutsy?
[05:22] <bbrown> just wanted to say if there are any ubuntu developers on, good job.  I really like Gutsy so far
[05:22] <elninja> MidnighToker, thanks!
[05:22] <KevinO> seamus7: yea i already did that
[05:22] <Colro> Is there a way to temporarily disable xserver-xgl without uninstalling it? I can't find it in sessions when logging on

[05:22]  * IpMoo was very impress'd with 7.10  untill the last 2 updats
[05:22] <MidnighToker> [[Charlie]]: thanks :)
[05:22] <riotkittie> elninja: Alt + CTRL + F1  while it loads. or remove the kernel options quiet & splash in grub [replace splash with no splash]
[05:23] <_tux> lol Dan
[05:23] <KevinO> Vlet, come on man where have you been I already had asked my question
[05:23] <youknowme> gouranga, open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" but make sure you know what video driver you are using first.
[05:23] <_tux> trying to get myself to switch to either Slackware or Gentoo soon
[05:23] <TwoD> Anyone who's having problems with the Appearance Prefs dialogue in Gutsy?
[05:23] <nickrud> elninja: remove quiet splash from the kernel lines in /boot/grub/menu.lst (make it permanent with changing defopts to emptyu string
[05:23] <Madpilot> ubotu, source-o-matic | josenj76
[05:23] <ubotu> josenj76: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[05:23] <merula> _tux: the problem is that I can't get the desktop effects to be enabled.
[05:23] <seamus7> Kevin0: are you using wireless and security? when you go into manual configuration does it still list your static configuration as the active one?
[05:23] <riotkittie> ew. whats up with my tab completion
[05:23] <Scabdates> so, no reason why my CMI soundcard (just installed gutsy gibbon) isn't emitting sound through my speakers?
[05:23] <josenj76> thanks ubotu
[05:23] <gouranga> youknowme i thought ubuntu was supposed to detect that.  no?
[05:23] <merula> _tux: not sure if that's related to my graphics card drivers or if it's just that I've sliced and diced the compiz updates I put in
[05:24] <Madpilot> josenj76, ubotu is a bot, just so you know. :)
[05:24] <_tux> merula, tried going to System >> Preferences >> Appearance (if exist)
[05:24] <Vlet> KevinO: you said, "anyone care to help me get my internet working again?"
[05:24] <epidodi> Does anyone know why I would have the process XRDB running about 15 times as a zombie in Gutsy?
[05:24] <gouranga> youknowme, how do I know what driver i am using?
[05:24] <_tux> then clicking on Visual Effects
[05:24] <josenj76> lol.... thanks Madpilot
[05:24] <juancis14> merula, whats your graphics card?
[05:24] <Back2Basics> does ubuntu have support for LVM?
[05:24] <merula> _tux: I did that -- errors out every time saying that they can't be started -- Nvidia 7800GT
[05:24] <KevinO> vlet yeah after i had asked my question!
[05:24] <iobelisk> i just installed sabayon linux and messed up my grub a bit. i am currently on ubuntu via live cd and this is what terminal says: grub> find /boot/grub/stage2
[05:24] <iobelisk>  (hd0,1)
[05:24] <iobelisk>  (hd0,3
[05:24] <merula> juancis14: nvidia 7800GT
[05:24] <Prax> hey can anyone help me with some ndiswrapper issues?
[05:24] <TwoD> The Appearance Preferences dialogue won't update when I click something. I know the buttons etc really work since things happen when I click them, but they won't update visually, neither does the tabs..
[05:24] <youknowme> gouranga, sometimes it can have a hard time detecting hardware, but not very often XD
[05:24] <juancis14> have u installed your video card drivers?
[05:24] <Dan2552> is there a way to skin the gnome panels?
[05:24] <Vlet> KevinO: if you already asked your question, then why would you ask that... nevermind
[05:25] <jimmygoon> epidodi, sorry pal. I looked at xrdb and I have no idea why it would be seemingly out of control like that... keep asking... maybe someone else will be more helpful
[05:25] <_tux> well when I first installed Gusty Gibbon it asked if I wanted to install Propietary Drivers which of course I did then had to fix my resolution and it started working but was confused at how to make it work
[05:25] <Insanity^> Is there anyone here who could help me with an installion issue?
[05:25] <seamus7> Kevin0: ?
[05:25] <_tux> weird merula
[05:25] <merula> juancis14: yes, I installed it first with the restriced driver thing.
[05:25] <IpMoo> Insanity^,   whats wrong
[05:25] <KevinO> vlet you are full of very unuseful information
[05:25] <Jban> How do you get a DVD to stop trying to play in Ubuntu, MPLayer is non-responsive.
[05:25] <iobelisk> how do i set it up so it reads GRUB menu.lst only from hd0,1 which is ubuntu, and then i can go there and edit menu.lst to show sabayon?
[05:25] <_tux> seems you got a high-end video card too
[05:25] <jimmygoon> !ask > Insanity^
[05:25] <gouranga> youknowme the video card is ati rage IIc
[05:25] <Jamesinator> I have ettercap running and passing all traffic in my home network into my local box, how can I analyze how much bandwidth individual IPs on the network are using?
[05:25] <Vlet> KevinO: thank you
[05:25] <nickrud> Jban: alt-f2 xkill , click the mplayer window
[05:25] <_tux> seems like you need drivers for it cause they might not be enabled
[05:25] <juancis14> i had to modify xorg.conf to enable xgl and compisite, maybe you have to...
[05:26] <KevinO> vlet your welcome
[05:26] <youknowme> gouranga, 1 second please
[05:26] <derek__> I'm a new ubuntu user (installed 30 minutes ago) and am wondering what the best way to get my background to cycle through different images (I know kde has this feature) is?
[05:26] <seamus7> Kevin0: you may have not noticed that I asked you an additional question above ... since you were busy with vlet
[05:26] <Insanity^> !ask I'm installing Kubuntu 7.10 and I can boot the CD, but when I choose to start the Live CD my screen just goes blank.
[05:26] <Jban> nickrud: What's xkill ?
[05:26] <Insanity^> Whoops. Not a command :D
[05:26] <Turner2> Hi ; I have a machine that has 2 processors, Ubuntu is having problems seeing 2 processors. Are there any reccomendations to fixing this besides me compiling my own kernel and enabling SMP?
[05:26] <KevinO> seamus7:  i did notice and i responded
[05:26] <nickrud> derek__: there's a script on gnome-look.org that does that, I think
[05:26] <_tux> by default Gusty Gibbon should prompt you to enable or download specific drivers for your video card if not you may have to download it from nVidia
[05:26] <epidodi> jimmygoon, does zombied mean that they will eventually just go away on their own?
[05:26] <merula> juancis14 & _tux: would I need to add something like xgl or aigx to get this to start working? Any ideas?
[05:26] <iobelisk> can anybody here help me with repairing GRUB please?
[05:26] <jimmygoon> epidodi, I dunna, you used that term, not me :P
[05:26] <nickrud> Jban: its an app that forces an X window app to die
[05:27] <_tux> xgl isn't necessary nor is aiglx that I know of
[05:27] <IpMoo> Insanity^,   i question the download
[05:27] <pupster> anyone know much about changing PKG_CONFIG_PATH so i can get a program that needs glib2.0 to see I have it as libglib2.0?
[05:27] <rouben> Turner2: are you sure your kernel doesn't see the 2 CPUs? Did you check /proc/cpuinfo?
[05:27] <merula> _tux: that's what I thought... yeesh this is confusing.
[05:27] <Prax> anyone good with ndiswrapper?
[05:27] <youknowme> gouranga, first do this command "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup"
[05:27] <Jban> nickrud: When I clikc alt+f2 it brings up a window about running it?
[05:27] <epidodi> jimmygoon, that is what ubuntu says - it says the processes are zombies
[05:27] <crdlb> pupster, you need the -dev package
[05:27] <Insanity^> IpMoo, The md5 checks out.
[05:27] <IpMoo> Insanity^,   the computer is set in bios to use CD as 1st boot >??
[05:27] <Dan2552> merula: are you using an ATI card?
[05:27] <jimmygoon> epidodi, where does it say that at?
[05:27] <_tux> yeah I don't like messing with stuff like this myself cause I am still new to it
[05:27] <nickrud> Jban: type xkill in that window, it's like the run window in windows
[05:27] <bruenig> pupster, yeah it's just a matter of getting the headers unfortunately
[05:27] <merula> Dan2552: Nope -- Nvidia 7800GT
[05:27] <crdlb> pupster, if there's a version of it in the repos, run sudo apt-get build-dep <packagename>
[05:27] <epidodi> jimmygoon, in the system monitor
[05:27] <juancis14> i added some lines at xorg.conf
[05:27] <Insanity^> IpMoo, I've installed other linux distros on this machine before, and yeah. The bios is correct
[05:27] <seamus7> Kevin0: nope... you reponded to my first attempt at helping you .. then you got into a back and forth with vlet ... I tried to help you further and asked questions ... see way above
[05:27] <youknowme> gouranga, trhen write this one down in case something goes wrong "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[05:27] <merula> btw -- I have a dual monitor setup.
[05:28] <secret901> How do I get my wireless card working after it stopped working when I resume from suspend?
[05:28] <nickrud> Jban: I tend to use that rather than the menu, it's faster :)
[05:28] <Dan2552> merula: oh... with my ATI card i had to install some XGL server thing
[05:28] <iobelisk> how can i repair GRUB from a live cd session?
[05:28] <KevinO> seamus7: my bad
[05:28] <amrcidiot> hey guys the new ubuntu update (7.10 i think) won't let me open add/remove and alot of other things
[05:28] <amrcidiot> any ideas?
[05:28] <IpMoo> Insanity^,   i hear u i hadd issues witha 7.10 final i d/l'd
[05:28] <jimmygoon> epidodi, open a gnome-terminal and type "ps ax | grep xrdb" and tell me (roughly) what the output looks like
[05:28] <Jban> nickrud: MPlayer wont close
[05:28] <nickrud> !grub | iobelisk
[05:28] <ubotu> iobelisk: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[05:28] <IpMoo> im on hold for real disks
[05:28] <_tux> merula, tried going to System >> Administration >> Resticted Drivers Manager?
[05:28] <`eric-> hey do all the themes that worked on feisty work on gutsy?
[05:28] <Madpilot> when I try to get "Normal" ie with Compiz visual effects running, I get a popup that says, "The Composite extension is not available" - in synaptic it looks like all the compiz stuff installed properly, but what am I missing?
[05:28] <Vlet> secret901: try right clicking on the network manager, and unckeck 'networking enabled' and then recheck it
[05:28] <epidodi> what does ps ax mean
[05:28] <gouranga> youknowme ok
[05:28] <_tux> that's where I enabled my video card for Compiz Fusion
[05:28] <Madpilot> `eric-, they should, yes
[05:28] <epidodi> I understand grep
[05:28] <nickrud> Jban: then in a terminal, type killall -9 mplayer    or   gmplayer
[05:28] <Dan2552> ps ax i think lists processes
[05:29] <crdlb> Madpilot, fglrx? if so install xserver-xgl
[05:29] <bruenig> secret901, what card is it?
[05:29] <epidodi> ok
[05:29] <woohoo> does compiz fusion comes with gutsy? wheres the settings page
[05:29] <Dan2552> ps x does atleast
[05:29] <nickrud> Jban: that's the biggest hammer available
[05:29] <crdlb> !ccsm | woohoo
[05:29] <Madpilot> crdlb, thanks
[05:29] <ubotu> woohoo: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[05:29] <merula> yeah, _tux done
[05:29] <juancis14> merula, did u restart x server when u instaled drivers?
[05:29] <merula> juancis14: yes yes.
[05:29] <amrcidiot> they just don't load
[05:29] <jimmygoon> epidodi, it lists running processes
[05:29] <seamus7> !ccsm
[05:29] <djlenoir> madpilot: run sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl and reboot if you have an ati card.
[05:29] <Jban> nickrud: That worked
[05:29] <merula> _tux: btw, I can't pull up CCSM anymore...
[05:29] <iobelisk> ubotu, nickrud, hi. i did not lose grub after installing windows, but sabayon. when i run the find grub command on the live cd terminal it shows both on hd0,1 (ubuntu) and hd0,3 (sabayon), how do i load only the ubuntu grub so i can load it and then edit it to include sabayon in it later
[05:29] <l3rutalforce> So is there free cd for the Ubuntu v 7.10
[05:29] <_tux> merula, tried running: compiz --replace inside a terminal
[05:30] <Madpilot> djlenoir, thanks
[05:30] <secret901> bruenig: it's an    Intel IPW3945 Wireless Ethernet (802.11a/b/g)  card

[05:30] <secret901> bruenig: on an official Dell Linux laptop
[05:30] <juancis14> merula try to run glxgears to see if u have 3d acel...
[05:30] <pupster> crdlb, bruenig : thanks! .. got it to work ..
[05:30] <merula> _tux: starts emerald, then segfaults
[05:30] <_tux> damn
[05:30] <epidodi> when I do it, it lists all of the xrdb processes
[05:30] <merula> juancis14: done -- works
[05:30] <bruenig> secret901, heh, well I still don't know if ubuntu is using iwl3945 or ipw3945, ipw3945 requires a userspace daemon
[05:30] <KevinO> seamus, I do have a wireless router, but i am hard wired to it.network interfaces
[05:30] <youknowme> now to find out what driver you are using type this command into a terminal "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and then search around but DON'T change anything.
[05:30] <darobman> has anyone run into boot problems /w Ubuntu 7.10 for amd 64 for desktops?
[05:30] <nickrud> Jban: iobelisk the technique is the same, chrooting to the ubuntu install and editing the grub file
[05:31] <juancis14> composite extension is working?
[05:31] <Jban> Wooheww, I got my DVD to play err... wait, it was playing and now it froze... and then closed. Arg!!!  Why is it so difficult for DVDs to play on Linux.
[05:31] <amrcidiot> anyone?
[05:31] <jimmygoon> epidodi, thats very strange... I don't have any xrdb processes :(
[05:31] <youknowme> gouranga, now to find out what driver you are using type this command into a terminal "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and then search around but DON'T change anything.
[05:31] <secret901> bruenig: is that the driver?
[05:31] <juancis14> i dont know how to check that...
[05:31] <epidodi> sigh
[05:31] <bruenig> secret901, depending on which one it is, you will need to modprobe the module, (start the daemon maybe), and then bring up the interface maybe
[05:31] <_tux> merula, tried reading this http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Troubleshooting
[05:31] <portablejim> how do you 'mount' a directory to another place (on your file-system)?
[05:31] <nickrud> Jban: kill -15 (same as xkill) tells a process to exit normally, -9 kills it unconditionally. -9 is for last resort
[05:31] <bruenig> secret901, yeah there are two drivers
[05:31] <secret901> bruenig: how do I do that?
[05:31] <chowmeined> What can I do if suspend isn't working?
[05:31] <_tux> its a troubleshooting wiki for compiz fusion
[05:31] <Vlet> portablejim: it sounds like you want a link
[05:31] <jimmygoon> portablejim, what do you mean "mount" a directory?
[05:32] <jimmygoon> portablejim, I agree with Vlet.....
[05:32] <bruenig> secret901, do modinfo iwl3945 and see if it says somthing
[05:32] <merula> _tux: alright, thanks.
[05:32] <derrrface> "Desktop Effects could not be Enabled" upgrade to 7.10.... any idea how to fix this?
[05:32] <youknowme> gouranga, you should be looking for something like:
[05:32] <youknowme> Section "Device"
[05:32] <youknowme> 	Identifier	"Generic Video Card"
[05:32] <youknowme> 	Driver		"nvidia"
[05:32] <youknowme> 	BusID		"PCI:2:0:0"
[05:32] <_tux> merula, I don't know if that'll help but stay in the room just in case
[05:32] <portablejim> I thought of a hard link, but somtimes you can't link directories.
[05:32] <Dan2552> portablejim: do you mean make a virtual link so like /tmp/1 goes to the same place as /home/dan ?
[05:32] <`eric-> what type of format does ubuntu themes require? i've downloaded a gdm theme from gnome-look.org but it says "invalid theme type"
[05:32] <MaTrIx-X> Anyone here know much about icsitarget?
[05:32] <crdlb> derrrface, what video card?
[05:32] <secret901> bruenig: should it say something? I don't have that problem now since I restarted the laptop
[05:32] <juancis14> derrrface, have u instaled restricted drivers?
[05:32] <chowmeined> Jban: because its illegal
[05:32] <l3rutalforce> Isn't there Ubuntu v 7.10 cd release for free?
[05:32] <merula> _tux: I'll be here off and on -- there is beer floating around.
[05:32] <epidodi> jimmygoon, if you were I what would you do?
[05:33] <_tux> if nobody can help here on that issue I am sure the compiz fusion forum may be of some help
[05:33] <AmyRose> !compiz
[05:33] <bruenig> secret901, it should either say module not found or spit out a bunch of technical stuff
[05:33] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - help in #compiz-fusion
[05:33] <_tux> lol
[05:33] <gouranga> youknowme, it says Driver "ati"
[05:33] <nickrud> `eric-: they are marked as gtk themes
[05:33] <jimmygoon> come here and ask for help and/or ignore it :S
[05:33] <derrrface> crdlb: not sure, I know its nvid based w/ 128mb ram
[05:33] <amrcidiot> k thanksfor the help
[05:33] <amrcidiot> alot
[05:33] <Jban> nickrud: Hey Nick, would you mind answering a few questions that I have about why what I did just worked, and why what I tried before that did not in regards to DVD playing?
[05:33] <bobgill> I just installed Gutsy and can't play DVDs, anyone ??
[05:33] <nickrud> `eric-: gdm themes are for the login manageer
[05:33] <secret901> bruenig: when I get back from suspend, it disconnects from the network and tries to get back on...if I try to get online before that, then it permanently can't get online
[05:33] <nickrud> Jban: sure
[05:33] <crdlb> derrrface, open a terminal and run compiz --replace
[05:33] <dystopianray> bobgill: it does not play dvds out of the box
[05:33] <juancis14> derr face check it at system admin restricted drivers
[05:33] <derrrface> juancis14: dont think so, how do i check 4 sure?
[05:33] <djlenoir> dvd playback on *nix is illegal?
[05:33] <_tux> bobgill, tried installing propietary codecs
[05:33] <chowmeined> Jban: because of US law there isn't a way to play DVDs legally without using (buying) proprietary software
[05:34] <jimmygoon> no its not
[05:34] <nickrud> Jban: just be prepared for the 'duh, I dunno's :)
[05:34] <juancis14> let me see and i tell u
[05:34] <secret901> bruenig: it says Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG/BG Network Connection driver for Linux
[05:34] <Dan2552> doesn't that make VLC illegal then?
[05:34] <bruenig> secret901, ok good, so it is using iwl3945 then
[05:34] <dystopianray> djlenoir: no not becuase it's linux but becuase you haven't paid patent licenses and neither have the distributors of the dvd playback software
[05:34] <_tux> Dan2552, lol I would say the same thing
[05:34] <MaTrIx-X> jban: VLC plays DVD's just fine last time I checked
[05:34] <TECH_1> Use (GTK) dvd burning
[05:34] <nickrud> Dan2552: no, just using it to play dvd's
[05:34] <bobgill> what codecs must I install ??
[05:34] <secret901> bruenig: what's the other driver?
[05:34] <bruenig> secret901, that comes out when you do modinfo iwl3945 right?
[05:34] <_tux> doesn't mplayer also play DVDs
[05:34] <secret901> bruenig: yes
[05:34] <_tux> I know VLC plays dvds
[05:34] <jimmygoon> but if you've ever bought a dvd player, or bought a pc w/ windows on it then you've paid the tax that goes towards "buying" that license for dvd playback
[05:34] <zhanx> _tux, yes
[05:35] <chowmeined> _tux: it does
[05:35] <nickrud> yes, mplayer, xine, totem, most any player with the right support libs
[05:35] <DShepherd> can any alt tab in the opposite direction when compiz is on?
[05:35] <bruenig> secret901, ok so all you need to do is sudo modprobe iwl3945
[05:35] <csc`> heh ubuntu screwed up my system clock
[05:35] <juancis14> marula, check your xorg.conf
[05:35] <jimmygoon> DShepherd, you should be able to hold shift and do so
[05:35] <secret901> bruenig: so I do that when it stops working?
[05:35] <youknowme> gouranga, ok, good, now open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and select ati as your vid driver and then just use defaults for everything else, except for when it comes to resolutions, so pay attention and when it comes to resolutions be sure to pic the one you want. Don't get to high of one for your card though XD
[05:35] <darobman> anyone having trouble booting the live cd (7.10 amd 64 desktop)?
[05:35] <juancis14> there should be
[05:35] <bruenig> secret901, and then optionally you need to bring the interface up which probably means you need to do sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
[05:35] <dystopianray> jimmygoon: that doesn't make it legal on linux
[05:35] <crdlb> discussions about the legality of dvd playback are offtopic for this channel.
[05:35] <jimmygoon> DShepherd, just kidding, apparently that doesn't work
[05:35] <bruenig> secret901, network manager might do that, not sure
[05:35] <Jban> nickrud: Ok, after a lengthy process of installing random codes and all sorts of mess that I had no idea, and anyway, this finally allowed me to successfully attempt playing The Descent off of VLC Player.  Now, when I first started it up, I did the run disc selecting the "DVD" option, which made it play for the first 10 seconds then froze and closed... the second time, I selected "DVD Menues" and it started and contin
[05:35] <derrrface> crdlb: ran that, now what?
[05:35] <Dan2552> harry potter dvd came with a dvd player software on it IIRC
=== CarlF1 is now known as CarlFK
[05:35] <robbizzle> is this the spot for Noobs?
[05:35] <_tux> bobgill, install VLC or MPlayer is my advice
[05:36] <jimmygoon> dystopianray, why not? it has nothing to do with linux itself. It has to do with having access to that license, which as far as I'm concerned, I've proxy-paid for that several times
[05:36] <Dan2552> robbizzle: I'm a noob
[05:36] <crdlb> derrrface, did it succeed?
[05:36] <youknowme> robbizzle, it can be XD
[05:36] <Back2Basics> robbizzle, yup... welcome
[05:36] <chowmeined> where can I find information for troubleshooting suspend problems?
[05:36] <Colro> does anyone know how to enable mouse grabbing when running a program in a wine emulated desktop?
[05:36] <secret901> bruenig: Network Manager fails me in that area
[05:36] <crdlb> derrrface, if not, pastebin the output (use pastebin.com or similar)
[05:36] <robbizzle> can I run ubuntu on virtual pc through windows zp?
[05:36] <bruenig> secret901, just do those two things then
[05:36] <robbizzle> *xp
[05:36] <secret901> bruenig: thanks, I'll try that method next time it does that
[05:36] <gouranga> youknowme, i done that.
[05:36] <riotkittie> robbizzle: yea
[05:36] <portablejim> I was using hard links just I wondered if mount was able to do it better. But it obviously can't.
[05:36] <DShepherd> jimmygoon, yeah.. i figured that much. You know why? I cant seem to even set those keys
[05:36] <Vlet> robbizzle: yes
[05:36] <youknowme> gouranga, you pick your resolution?
[05:36] <nickrud> Jban: I'm not an expert on this, but simply installing vlc and libdvdcss2 from medibuntu made my dvd playing painless
[05:36] <whyameye> why is the help center opening automatically every time I boot? gutsy
[05:36] <gouranga> youknowme, yep
[05:36] <Dan2552> robbizzle: try qemu, or maybe MS virtual pc
[05:36] <robbizzle> any link to a tutorial to help me out?
[05:36] <crdlb> robbizzle, just don't expect the 3d effects to work :)
[05:36] <Back2Basics> robbizzle, yup
[05:36] <robbizzle> no 3d?
[05:37] <Jban> nickrud: Yeah I got it to play now, I was just asking a knowledge question.
[05:37] <jimmygoon> DShepherd, hm, I don't particularly like the compiz defaults... :S
[05:37] <Dan2552> robbizzle: 3D stuff wont work in a virtual pc
[05:37] <robbizzle> oh ok
[05:37] <juancis14> check if in your xorg.conf says somethin like "composite" "Enable"
[05:37] <djlenoir> dystopianray, interesting, so is there a legal open source dvd player that you can pay for?
[05:37] <Iamthey> yeah
[05:37] <Vlet> robbizzle: google
[05:37] <nickrud> Jban: I dunno ;)
[05:37] <Jban> lol
[05:37] <DShepherd> jimmygoon, so is that a "I dont know"?
[05:37] <dystopianray> jimmygoon: 'as far as i'm concerned' still doesn't make it legal, just becuase you think it is fair and reasonable means nothing
[05:37] <robbizzle> do you need a ton of ram for 3d effects like you do for vista?

[05:38] <zamarax> hey guys, I've been reading tons of forums and no one seems to have a locked down answer, I am in the live ubuntu cd version 7.10 and i need to install grub to a partition and NOT to the MBR, how can I do this?
[05:38] <Prax> ok so I installed ndiswrapper from the CD its version 1.9 but when ever I try to modeprobe for it, it says it can't open a file ndiswrapper.ko any suggestions?
[05:38] <nickrud> Jban: ibid ;)
[05:38] <derrrface> ubotu: sorry
[05:38] <ubotu> It's ok, I can't stay mad at you.

[05:38] <dystopianray> djlenoir: I think linspire had a legal dvd player for linux
[05:38] <youknowme> gouranga, cool, now restart your system, be sure to have "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf" handy in case something goes sour :)
[05:38] <youknowme> Also I may not be here when you get back, gonna head off to bed, so don't think I snubbed you XD
[05:38] <chowmeined> Dan2552: it didnt in feisty...
[05:38] <chowmeined> Dan2552: and it doesnt if i use nvidia driver
[05:38] <kyleBAKED> how can i set write permissions for all users for an external harddrive?
[05:38] <nickrud> rflol, somone's been giving ubotu a sense of humor
[05:38] <riotkittie> jimmygoon: do you know the terms of that license?  to a "T"?
[05:39] <secret901> bruenig: is it supposed to say something when I modprobe if it's already working?
[05:39] <robbizzle> would you reccomend a dual boot then? Im not ready to completely wean myself off of xp
[05:39] <Vlet> nickrud: yeah, that's pretty funny
[05:39] <robbizzle> also
[05:39] <juancis14> too late, gonna sleep :P

[05:39] <riotkittie> oh wait, i'm ot. <shuts up>
[05:39] <krammer> does anybody use Gusty?
[05:39] <Vlet> robbizzle: probably a good idea
[05:39] <Dan2552> chowmeined: i'm not sure it's accoiciated with graphics driver
[05:39] <Vlet> krammer: lots
[05:39] <bruenig> secret901, no
[05:39] <riotkittie> robbizzle: go for it.
[05:39] <robbizzle> can you rund your windows partition inside ubuntu?
[05:39] <crdlb> derrrface, ok that's fixable (at least it should be)
[05:39] <mattg> krammer: yes
[05:39] <robbizzle> like u can w/ mac
[05:39] <secret901> bruenig: if it's not working, what should it say?
[05:39] <dystopianray> jimmygoon: the license fees are per player, not a once-off fee, I can't tell you waht laws you are breaking as I don't know what country you live in
[05:39] <riotkittie> robbizzle: run as in access? or run as in... ?
[05:39] <stan_ley> Q: Which is better or do u prefer? VMWARE or VIRTUALBOX ?
[05:39] <Jban> Oh, well, I am gonna enjoy my DVD now...  thanks for gnomefreak helping me initially, and I just went on my own after that installing any codec that it seemed might help and then re-trying VLC.
[05:39] <merula_> yo _tux, I'm back -- sry
[05:39] <robbizzle> as in windowed....
[05:39] <kyleBAKED> does anyone know how to set write permissions for an external harddrive?
[05:39] <mattg> stan_ley: virtualbox
[05:39] <_tux> merula, welcome back ;-)
[05:39] <Dan2552> robbizzle: you can access it, but running your current partition in a virtual pc probably WONT work
[05:39] <derrrface> crdlb: how?
[05:40] <gouranga> youknowme, thanks for your help. I sincerely appreciate it. But i did not do anything so i don't think rebooting will help.
[05:40] <robbizzle> hmm
[05:40] <jimmygoon> dystopianray, bastards... well, I don't care anyway, maybe it is illegal... screw 'em
[05:40] <chowmeined> Dan2552: i looked around in dmesg, and i ran gnome-power-manager in --no-daemon to see what was going on.. but all i got was, DBUS timed out, recovering... wakeup emitted
[05:40] <robbizzle> just though it may be like mac os
[05:40] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: what kind of partition on the external?
[05:40] <bruenig> secret901, modprobe won't know if it is working in the way you are thinking of the word
[05:40] <kyleBAKED> fat32
[05:40] <jimmygoon> dystopianray, actualyl I don't think I've ever watched a dvd on my laptop before so :S
[05:40] <bruenig> secret901, it will know if the module was probed or not, nothing else
[05:40] <krammer> Does anybody use Gusty?
[05:40] <kyleBAKED> ive tried chmodding the mount point with chmod -R 777 /media/disk
[05:40] <merula_> krammer: I do
[05:40] <youknowme> gouranga, you didn't do anything? or IT didn't do anything?
[05:40] <crdlb> derrrface, gksu gedit /etc/drirc
[05:40] <secret901> krammer: yes
[05:40] <_tux> krammer, am using it
[05:40] <Vlet> robbizzle: no, there is no 'parallels' built into ubuntu
[05:40] <mattg> krammer: YES!  dont ask
[05:40] <robbizzle> well thanks everyone, I'm going to go try...anyone want to volunteer to be my tech support via AIM?
[05:40] <kyleBAKED> but still can't write with a user
[05:40] <stan_ley> <mattg> yea me too, vmware too much work
[05:40] <IpMoo> krammer,   lost of ppls
[05:40] <krammer> dont ask what?

[05:41] <mattg> robizzle: what do you need support on?
[05:41] <chowmeined> Dan2552: oh ok
[05:41] <krammer> what is the difference than fiesty?
[05:41] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: sorry, I know how to do it with ext3, don't have a vfat external
[05:41] <robbizzle> will do
[05:41] <robbizzle> thanks a lot
[05:41] <secret901> krammer: read the release notes

[05:41] <Jban> Audio Question: How do I get the sound playing off of VLC on my DVD, to play through my Logitech USB headset?  I already have all the audio devices selected as USB and my device as USB headset, but it still plays through my laptop speakers.
[05:41] <robbizzle> i'll report back
[05:41] <derrrface> crdlb: blank doc in gedit
[05:41] <marx2k> I really wish that the Ubuntu install CDs still used gparted :(
[05:41] <mattg> stan_ley: yup, virtualbox is so easy to setup and use.  currently using it with an xp install going right now
[05:41] <bobgill> I don't know what to install to get DVDs to play, I've installed Xine, VLC and mplayer... anything else ??
[05:41] <IpMoo> 7.04 and 7.10  night and day
[05:41] <kyleBAKED> nickrud, how do you do it with ext3?
[05:41] <gouranga> youknowme, all I did since you've been helping me was back up xorg,conf.  i didn't do anything that would make it reboot into any other state than the last reboot did.
[05:41] <bruenig> bobgill, think codecs, not players
[05:41] <mattg> krammer: it's just waaaay good!
[05:41] <crdlb> derrrface, yes that's normal
[05:41] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: but I can tell you that chmodding or chowning the mount point won't work; and it does with ext3
[05:41] <KevinO> ok when i try to restart networking, it says *reconfigureing network interfaces.... / SIOCADDRT: no such process / Failed to bring up eth0
[05:41] <jimmygoon> !dvd
[05:42] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at !Medibuntu or (for Feisty and earlier) http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs
[05:42] <dystopianray> bobgill: you need libdvdcss2
[05:42] <crdlb> derrrface, you're creating it
[05:42] <krammer> what kind of threads it is using?
[05:42] <secret901> krammer: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour
[05:42] <riotkittie> marx2k: me tooooooooo, but the gparted live CD's a small download, and always good to have on hand :P
[05:42] <bruenig> bobgill, *nix apps share libraries, the mindset needs to shift to understand that
[05:42] <krammer> been there
[05:42] <stan_ley> MAN THERE ARE LOTS OF PPL HERE!!
[05:42] <IpMoo> stan_ley,    thats a good thing
[05:42] <KevinO> i cant even get dhcp to work anymore
[05:42] <derrrface> crdlb: lol, ok.. what next?
[05:42] <secret901> krammer: in my experience it's much worse than Feisty
[05:42] <MaTrIx-X> anyone have good suggestions for Gutsy repositories? (aside what comes preset)
[05:42] <stan_ley> not if u cant catch wats going on
[05:42] <secret901> krammer: a lot of things are broken
[05:42] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, what are you trying to do? mount vfat with user perms to write/read?
[05:42] <Dan2552> lpMoo: isn't it giving you a headache trying to keep up with it all?
[05:42] <marx2k> actually it looks like if you drop to a terminal in the Ubuntu install CD, gparted is installed... you just need to be able to run it :)
[05:42] <crdlb> derrrface, save and close, then try compiz --replace again
[05:43] <kyleBAKED> jimmygoon, yes sir
[05:43] <bobgill> I have libdvdcss2 as well, still no luck
[05:43] <nickrud> jimmygoon: on an external automount
[05:43] <marx2k> meaning you just have to know to run it
[05:43] <jimmygoon> ... nickrud that should be default, no?
[05:43] <marx2k> Im running gparted within the Ubuntu install CD right now :)
[05:43] <KevinO> can i delete my networking/interfaces cinfig and generate a new one?
[05:43] <KevinO> config*
[05:43] <IpMoo> Dan2552,   its a little slow  auctualy  and the server should eplay data  flow.. so's to smooth out the  chatt
[05:43] <youknowme> gouranga, oh.. you want me to explain it again? or..
[05:43] <_tux> bobgill, you tried installing vlc?
[05:43] <jimmygoon> I know the mount options on a single mount command that work... but I have no idea how to configure automount magic
[05:43] <nickrud> jimmygoon: I would hope so, but don't know. Don't have one to check
[05:43] <bobgill> _tux: it is installed
[05:44] <secret901> if Gutsy doesn't even work in a an officially supported Dell Linux computer, I doubt it will work in other places.
[05:44] <_tux> not working eh
[05:44] <jimmygoon> nickrud, well, mine all do... something is messed up probably
[05:44] <merula_> _tux: okay, so I read through the troubleshooting page -- no help
[05:44] <kyleBAKED> it is mounted with vfat defaults 0 1
[05:44] <Dan2552> lpMoo: but I'm a speed reader, and finding it hard to read everything
[05:44] <Jban> Audio Question: How do I get the sound playing off of VLC on my DVD, to play through my Logitech USB headset?  I already have all the audio devices selected as USB and my device as USB headset, but it still plays through my laptop speakers.
[05:44] <robbizzle> ok im back for my first question
[05:44] <nickrud> jimmygoon: kyleBAKED 's talking about allowing all users, not just the live X session
[05:44] <derrrface> crdlb: same response
[05:44] <robbizzle> don't have a dvd drive on my laptop, can I do a network install from my other pc?
[05:44] <IpMoo> Dan2552,   thats why i suggest they use data flow control
[05:44] <crdlb> derrrface, try rebooting
[05:44] <kyleBAKED> well, i only have one user account, i just said all for sake of typing
[05:45] <IpMoo> so the screen aint always  jumping
[05:45] <derrrface> crdlb: ok
[05:45] <stan_ley> <jba> how are headset connected ? on speakers ?
[05:45] <`eric-> i can't get any themes to install.. they never show up in the list.. no errors or anything.. the menus get all funky and stuff... but the window style doesn't really change.. i can change to any of the default themese though.. any ideas?
[05:45] <Jban> stan_ley: USB
[05:45] <_tux> merula, Don't know what to say man seems like the driver isn't enabled for compiz fusion or its something else
[05:45] <Jban> Logitech 350
[05:45] <Dan2552> 'eric-: I'm getting teh same thing on a theme I just made, i thought i was making it wrong
[05:45] <jimmygoon> nickrud, ah, well, maybe this can still help. this is what I use w/ truecrypt so that my users can edit a mounted partition that is encrypted file: -o gid=100,uid=1000,umask=000
[05:45] <IpMoo> Dan2552,   and u should filter out some of the chatt anyhow
[05:45] <IpMoo> :)
[05:45] <MaTrIx-X> I need some assistance with iscsitarget on Gutsy/amd64 if anyone is willing to help --- I've Googled til nothings left, posted on forums with no response, and I've been trying to get this working for the 2nd day straight
[05:45] <Dan2552> lpMoo: I'm using opera, no idea if it can even do that
[05:45] <merula_> _tux: alrighty thanks for the help at least.
[05:45] <riotkittie> uhm. secret901, something tells me that this officially  supported Dell Linux cp wasn't bought with gutsy preinstalled, nor did anyone guarentee that it would work with gutsy. but getting it to do so shouldnt be the end of the world. i have it running fine on a dell laptop and dell desktop, both made long before dell started selling boxes with  ubuntu preinstalled
[05:45] <`eric-> Dan2552: did you fix it?
[05:45] <_tux> merula, sorry bro
[05:46] <gouranga> youknowme, no thank you.  I've ubuntu on this extra PC for a while because I'bve heard a lot about it.  But I can't seem to configure it, although I find no problem with my slackware and gentoo computers.  I must be looking at it wrong.
[05:46] <robbizzle> can I message someone or can you message me  to help me out on my first install?
[05:46] <Vlet> `eric-: if you click 'customize' on a theme, you can pick what you installed... the 'themes' you install are different from the themes in the list. the themes you install are themes for either window borders, or controls or icons, etc
[05:46] <kyleBAKED> jimmygoon, do i append that to the end of my fstab entry?
[05:46] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, in that case, it really ought to work out of box, let me plug in my drive and see what it mounts with
[05:46] <Dan2552> `eric-: no, thats why i actually came here but no one replied
[05:46] <KevinO>  can anyone help me with configuring my network, I had it set to dhcp, then i needed to set it to static, then i tried to restart the network, and it says SIOCADDRT no such process / Falied to bring up eth0, i try to set it back to dhcp and it says the same thing
[05:46] <marx2k> wow... Gutsy hates NVidia it seems
[05:46] <stan_ley> jban: audio port ?
[05:46] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, you shouldn't have to :S
[05:46] <_tux> bobgill, try installing mplayer if that doesn't work you may need specific codecs like an GStreamer codec
[05:46] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, let me see what happens when i plug mine in
[05:46] <djlenoir> anyone have one of the ubuntu dell computers? what dvd software is included on those?
[05:46] <nickrud> jimmygoon: good for the terminal or fstab ;) kyleBAKED you might try adding that to the mount options of the volume tab when you right click the icon on the desktop (look for the triagle near the bottom)
[05:46] <secret901> riotkittie: that's right, that's why I should have stuck with Feisty.  It was working perfectly.
[05:46] <Vlet> marx2k: did you upgrade or install?
[05:46] <IpMoo> marx2k,   im wondering about that caus e all i see  is that  issue
[05:46] <bobgill> ok
[05:46] <marx2k> VLet: Upgrade... now Im having to install :)
[05:46] <Jban> stan_ley: ISN
[05:46] <Jban> stan_ley: USB
[05:47] <marx2k> IpMoo: mainly broken kernel modules
[05:47] <crdlb> marx2k, did you use envy at any point?
[05:47] <youknowme> gouranga, ok then, I hope you figure it out somewhere along the line lol. Either way, I'm off to bed, good luck!
[05:47] <robbizzle> please help :'(
[05:47] <pavs> exit
[05:47] <Dan2552> `eric-: it would be good to know that its not my theme breaking things... I spent quite a while on it, also being my 1st theme
[05:47] <marx2k> crdlb: *hangs head* yes
[05:47] <Vlet> marx2k: yeah, it didn't like mine after upgrading, but after installing, it was seamless
[05:47] <kyleBAKED> jimmygoon, nickrud, it is in my fstab as /dev/sdb1 /media/disk vfat defaults 0 1
[05:47] <riotkittie> secret901: what issue/s are you having?
[05:47] <MaTrIx-X> Is my text transmitting? -- anyone able to see this?
[05:47] <riotkittie> MaTrIx-X: maybe :x
[05:47] <crdlb> marx2k, well another person who used envy in feisty had the same error after upgrading
[05:47] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, why is it in your fstab?
[05:47] <nanbudh> so guys ,any ideas with this problem:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=583589?
[05:47] <gouranga> youknowme thanks again!
[05:47] <scguy318> MaTRlx-X: no
[05:47] <stan_ley> jban: do u use kde; if so check out kmix output settings
[05:47] <robbizzle> matrix-x: nope
[05:47] <IpMoo> MaTrIx-X,   all is good
[05:47] <kyleBAKED> to automount
[05:47] <kyleBAKED> i thought that was procedure
[05:47] <Jban> stan_ley: Ubuntu7.10 Gnome
[05:47] <Byron> hey anyone here use avant-window-navigator ?
[05:47] <_tux> bobgill, MPEG2 is a propietary codec so it isn't automatically installed by default
[05:48] <riotkittie> !envy [wheeee]
[05:48] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about envy [wheeee] - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:48] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, ... you don't have to add it manually
[05:48] <crdlb> it seems that the great envy-breaking update has come
[05:48] <marx2k> crdlb: yep...then I messed with it to the point where my mouse stopped working and replacing old xorg.conf's didnt bring it back so now Im reinstalling
[05:48] <riotkittie> oops.
[05:48] <robbizzle> again, anyone feel like guiding a noob one on one??????
[05:48] <jimmygoon> try commenting that out and then just plugging the device in
[05:48] <marx2k> (and unfortunately wiping a  lot of precious info)
[05:48] <secret901> riotkittie: 1. It's not suspending/hibernating correctly, and 2. the wireless connection stops working after a resume from suspend (if it actually resume at all)
[05:48] <Dan2552> robbizzle: about what?
[05:48] <tritium> crdlb: envy is the breaking element
[05:48] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: a sec,
[05:48] <crdlb> tritium, yes I know :)
[05:48] <Rich4> I'm having trouble in 7.1
[05:48] <robbizzle> I have never used or installed ubuntu
[05:48] <jimmygoon> marx2k, then backup your data. use a live disc and mount your hd
[05:48] <scguy318> mark2k: you shouldnt have to wipe all that precious info, you can just backup
[05:48] <kyleBAKED> okay, so remove that from fstab and let it mount automatically?
[05:48] <crdlb> tritium, I hate it more than I hate automatix
[05:48] <robbizzle> but I have no DVD drive on laptop
[05:48] <Dan2552> robbizzle: this is my 1st time, but maybe i can help you
[05:48] <jimmygoon> marx2k, or better yet, just reset your xorg.conf... its not hard to do
[05:48] <marx2k> jimmy: cant back it up... not enough room
[05:48] <tritium> crdlb: ;)
[05:48] <Allenwr> hey, I need some help
[05:49] <Vlet> robbizzle: so get the CD
[05:49] <marx2k> jimmy: I reconfigured my xorg.conf and still no dice
[05:49] <bruenig> !enter | robbizzle
[05:49] <ubotu> robbizzle: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[05:49] <jimmygoon> marx2k, network?
[05:49] <MoLerner> so what would cause ubuntu not to be able to connect to a wireless network that's easily in range? it can detect the networks, but for secured networks it just asks for the pass over and over again (even though it's right), and for unsecured networks it just tries forever to connect
[05:49] <marx2k> too late now anyway, the disc is formatted :(
[05:49] <robbizzle> dan22552:can I do a network install?
[05:49] <marx2k> jimmy: nah its like 150 gigs of roms :)
[05:49] <jimmygoon> marx2k, did you do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver?
[05:49] <marx2k> yup
[05:49] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, yeah... try that
[05:49] <m0u5e> so i just installed gutsy, but planning on using easyBCD i did not install the grub bootloader... how do i boot gutsy using BCD w/out grub (is it even possible? -_-;)
[05:49] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: if this is an external that gets plugged and unplugged, try commenting out that line, the automounting should do it for you
[05:49] <Dan2552> robbizzle: good question, no idea
[05:49] <marx2k> and it still didnt work which is what bewildered me
[05:49] <jimmygoon> marx2k, eek
[05:49] <kyleBAKED> alright, i will try that
[05:49] <Vlet> !install | robbizzle
[05:49] <ubotu> robbizzle: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues - Don't want to use a CD? Try http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[05:49] <BaD-CrC> what would cause terminal based irc clients to say "cannot assign address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" when tying to connect to an irc server, but both Konversation and X-Chat connect fine?
[05:50] <marx2k> uh huh
[05:50] <josenj76> I just wanted to share a fix incase anyone has this same problems:  After I did a fresh install of Gutsy Gibbon, apt-get will break on many of the packages I wanted to install (ie X-Chat, wine) with "Broken package" error.  I went to http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic to regenerate a source.list file, ran "apt-get update" then "apt-get upgrade" and from there I was able to install both programs.
[05:50] <jimmygoon> marx2k, hm, thats no fun... in the future might I recommend a seperate partition for data... :D
[05:50] <jumbers> Where can I find xmms-flac?
[05:50] <stan_ley> jban: alsamixer ? btw, how do u make text red ?
[05:50] <marx2k> yep
[05:50] <riotkittie> !info xmms-flac
[05:50] <ubotu> Package xmms-flac does not exist in gutsy
[05:50] <marx2k> which is why at the moment Im trying to decide wether go give "/" 20 gigs or less
[05:50] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: but the proper stuff for an internal vfat is defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0 1
[05:50] <marx2k> Im thinking 20 is ok
[05:50] <jimmygoon> stan_ley, it comes from having your screenname in the line
[05:50] <IpMoo> josenj76,    thanks
[05:50] <Jban> stan_ley: what?
[05:50] <Rich4> I quit amarok in 7.1 but the system re-opens it. is there a certain way to turn that off?
[05:50] <m0u5e> so anyone know how to install grub w/out reinstalling my buntu? or getting gutsy working w/ easyBCD?
[05:50] <KevinO> is there any way to fix my networking?
[05:50] <stan_ley> jimmygoon: cool
[05:50] <kyleBAKED> ok thanks, guys, ill will try all this and see what comes out :S
[05:50] <DanaG> Oh hey, when will Hardy be worth bothering with?
[05:51] <jumbers> riotkittie: I know it doesn't exist in gutsy, but where can I download it from? I need it since a majority of my music collection is in FLAC
[05:51] <jimmygoon> Rich4 it will never die!, but sadly, I don't know how to stop that :S
[05:51] <riotkittie> m0u5e: you can install GRUB  from a live disc if you have one
[05:51] <punsad> m0u5e: apt-get install grub?
[05:51] <DanaG> I don't mind breakage -- it's fun to fix things.
[05:51] <Dan2552> m0u5e: can't you access the grub config file from live cd?
[05:51] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, what is wrong with it?
[05:51] <c_lisp> mouze you can download grub and burn it on a cd to reinstall it
[05:51] <m0u5e> punsad: .......
[05:51] <stan_ley> jban: check settings in alsamixer, make sure there all on
[05:51] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, plug in the wire :S
[05:51] <Rich4> jimmygoon: so we need to wait this out? :(
[05:51] <jimmygoon> DanaG, 5-6 months from now
[05:51] <marx2k> I suggest Super Grub Rescue Disc
[05:51] <kyleBAKED> ok cool, just letting it do its own thing works
[05:51] <m0u5e> c_lisp: is it possible to boot into gutsy w/out grub by using the EASYBCD vista bootloader?
[05:52] <jimmygoon> Rich4, did you install amarok manually?
[05:52] <Jban> stan_ley: But I want the sound to come through my USB headset, so why not have USB selected?
[05:52] <kyleBAKED> is there a way to remove the desktop icon for the drive though?
[05:52] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, good. yes
[05:52] <riotkittie> jumbers: try googling  >|
[05:52] <MoLerner> does anyone else see madly psychadelic vertical colored lines when restarting ubuntu?
[05:52] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, gconf-editor
[05:52] <c_lisp> mou5e im not sure never heard of easybcd
[05:52] <Rich4> I updated feisty to 7.1
[05:52] <KevinO> jimmygoon:  i tried to configure ot for static and then restart, it says SIOCADDRT: No such process/ Failed to bring up eth0
[05:52] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: don't mount it to /media
[05:52] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, its in there somewhere :P
[05:52] <marx2k> MoLerner, only when I drop acid
[05:52] <m0u5e> c_lisp: its a utility for windows which allows you to edit the windows bootloader BCD
[05:52] <KevinO> jimmygoon: now i cannot even get it set back to dhcp
[05:52] <jimmygoon> KevinO, did you manually configure it for static or did you use the gnome-networking tool?
[05:52] <Dan2552> c_lisp: are you the same c_lisp on my msn? (sorry for offtopic)
[05:52] <Rich4> goon: updated fawn 7.04 to 7.1
[05:52] <zyxnull> MoLerner: Me, it's normal
[05:52] <jumbers> riotkittie: I am and all I get is repo info pages listing dependencies and RPMs
[05:53] <c_lisp> windows bootload doesn't reconize linux partitions
[05:53] <KevinO> jimmygoon: i used the tool
[05:53] <MoLerner> what about not being able to connect to a wifi network that is easily connectable in windows?
[05:53] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: gconf-editor will turn off showing all devices in /media, like usb sticks. Better to choose something like /vfat or /external-windows-crap for the mountpoint
[05:53] <DanaG> I know Hardy is rather early -- where do things start?
[05:53] <secret901> anyone having trouble resuming from a suspend on a laptop in Feisty?
[05:53] <punsad> m0u5e: I don't think so.  You need some sort of linux bootloader.  EasyBCD is just a front end to edit the boot config for vista
[05:53] <jimmygoon> Rich4, and you had install amarok manually? its liekly some fluke of your system . maybe uninstall/reinstall amarok?
[05:53] <DanaG> Just new kernel and GCC, or something like that??
[05:53] <jimmygoon> KevinO, ouch, what happens when you load the tool now?
[05:53] <riotkittie> jumbers: hold on a sec. lemme see if i can play my FLACs, and if so, let me see if i can figure out how i managed :P
[05:53] <marx2k> Im also surprised they didnt include XChat on the install CD... youd think thatd be useful
[05:53] <stan_ley> jban: is it recognized ? [ cat /proc/asound/cards ]
[05:53] <zyxnull> MoLerner: What wifi card are you using?
[05:53] <_tux> alright see you guys all later thanks again for the help ;-)
[05:53] <m0u5e> punsad: so should i install grub to the partition in which buntu is installed though? rather in overwriting the vista bootloader
[05:53] <tux97> hi can u upgrade feisty fawn to gusty from the gusty cd?
[05:53] <akincer> mouse: Download Super Grub Disk
[05:53] <c_lisp> marx2k you can apt-get it quick anyways so it doesn't matter :)
[05:54] <jimmygoon> marx2k, I've always thought that... this channel is soooo useful
[05:54] <KevinO> it says idle, looks like its talking to the router, but not the outside
[05:54] <zyxnull> MoLerner: s/what/which
[05:54] <kyleBAKED> nickrud, Im no longer specifying a mount point, im just letting it mount itself
[05:54] <marx2k> c_lisp: yeah but noobs needing help during install would not know that :)
[05:54] <secret901> How do I remove all traces of kubuntu after I added kubuntu-desktop?
[05:54] <marx2k> jimmy: uh huh!
[05:54] <akincer> if you are trying to fix your boot roecord
[05:54] <MoLerner> Dell 1390 802.11g Mini Wireless Card (based of a broadcom chipset)
[05:54] <stan_ley> jban: or [ sudo lsusb ]
[05:54] <akincer> record
[05:54] <Jban> stan_ley: I dont know what you are asking with the [proc/sound] stuff
[05:54] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, is it getting an IP address from the router?
[05:54] <jumbers> riotkittie: Okay
[05:54] <jimmygoon> Kevin0 I'm assuming you are on a differnet pc?
[05:54] <MoLerner> i installed the restricted drivers and such
[05:54] <Rich4> jimmy: can i uninstall 7.1,revert back to 7.04?
[05:54] <Rich4> jimmy: can i revert v7.1 to 7.04?
[05:54] <marx2k> oooh I should find out if this kernel now has support for my PS2 -> PC USB joypad converter!
[05:55] <punsad> m0u5e: I'm trying to remember how I set it up
[05:55] <m0u5e> will super grub allow me to restore grub to a partition and not overwrite the vista BCD bootloader?
[05:55] <Vlet> secret901: that doesn't make much sense.. kubuntu-desktop is part of kubuntu
[05:55] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: I wish we could turn that off by device as well
[05:55] <MoLerner> running on gutsy
[05:55] <akincer> mouse: absolutely
[05:55] <c_lisp> marx2k theres a 7.10 version out now
[05:55] <KevinO> jimmygoon:  yes a diiferent pc, I can ping the router
[05:55] <jimmygoon> kyleBAKED, gconf-editor -> /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible
[05:55] <secret901> Vlet: I mean I installed kubuntu-desktop, now I want to remove all traces of it
[05:55] <m0u5e> akincer: so it will automatically detect gutsy for me? :D
[05:55] <marx2k> c_lisp: Yep thats what Im talking about
[05:55] <stan_ley> jban: open up teminal, then type [ sudo lsusb ] it will list recognized usb devices
[05:55] <tux97> how do u upgrade to gusty using a cd?
[05:55] <akincer> mouse: a friend of mine used it yesterday with great success
[05:55] <secret901> Vlet: the computer was originally ubuntu
[05:55] <akincer> ymmv
[05:55] <gvsa123> what file do you edit in ubuntu again if you want to add the ip address of your windows pc on a samba p2p? something to do about name resolution
[05:55] <MoLerner> zyxnull- what does that mean?
[05:55] <m0u5e> akincer: will i need to config it, is what i'm saying
[05:55] <marx2k> tux97: use the alternate install CD
[05:55] <Dan2552> marx2k: what use is one of those on linux? :p
[05:55] <akincer> mouse: he had to do very little
[05:56] <kyleBAKED> nickrud, jimmygoon, thank you two a lot
[05:56] <marx2k> Dan: Huh?
[05:56] <punsad> m0u5e: I'm trying to remember how I set it up
[05:56] <secret901> Vlet: I think it's what's causing all the headaches I'm having with Gutsy
[05:56] <nickrud> tux97: use the alternate install cd, and simply insert it. However, if you have any apps installed that aren't on the cd, it'll get them from the net
[05:56] <tux97> so just install it like i did with feisty?
[05:56] <akincer> http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/super-grub-disk-fix-windows-linux-boot.html
[05:56] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, from the other PC try this... ping 64.233.169.104
[05:56] <Dan2552> marx2k: well theres like no games to play using it
[05:56] <nickrud> kyleBAKED: hope you get things working as you like.
[05:56] <tux97> the cd is in
[05:56] <punsad> m0u5e: I used to triple boot winxp pr, vista and ubuntu
[05:56] <Jban> stan_ley: I see a lot of Logitech, Inc's
[05:56] <DShepherd> anyone here getting a libxml2 error about gconftool-2?
[05:56] <marx2k> Dan: Oh! haha it lets my media center ubuntu computer run as a MAME arcade box :)
[05:56] <Vlet> secret901: oh, apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop
[05:56] <c_lisp> I think grub auto configures for you these days.
[05:56] <marx2k> I can also run Amiga games on it...
[05:56] <Rich4> how do i revert back to feisty fawn?
[05:56] <marx2k> basically for emulation
[05:56] <DShepherd> cause i found the solution on the launchpad
[05:56] <Jban> stan_ley: My Logitech mouse is, my web cam is, and the rest are Logitech Incs
[05:56] <DShepherd> nickrud, ping
[05:56] <marx2k> tux97: theres a shell script in the root of the cd
[05:56] <marx2k> run it as root
[05:56] <marx2k> its like installsystem or something
[05:56] <DanaG> Oh yeah, I once had Vista and XP and Ubuntu installed, but then I deleted Vista to make more room for Ubuntu.
[05:57] <nickrud> update-grub causes grub to rescan os's and rewrite itself
[05:57] <nickrud> DShepherd: hola
[05:57] <lwizardl> everytime i try to open k9copy with a dvd in my drive i get a segfault any ideas how to fix?
[05:57] <tux97> ok whats the name of it?
[05:57] <_SlaK_> hello
[05:57] <Dan2552> marx2k: ah right, my PS2 controller (+usb) has been unused for about a year
[05:57] <m0u5e> nickrud: wait, can i use the ubuntu gutsy cd to reinstall grub?
[05:57] <secret901> Vlet: I ran that and it said that it's not installed.  But I still have a ton of KDE-specific apps around
[05:57] <riotkittie> jumbers: i cannot play them in XMMS. i can play them in audacious [which you should install as XMMS is deprecated, anyway]. If you can not immediately play them in audacious, try installing the audacious-plugins package
[05:57] <_SlaK_> how can I enter other severs?
[05:57] <DShepherd> nickrud, where we getting some libxml2 error thingy the other night while trying to assist me?
[05:57] <m0u5e> nickrud: if i don't have it installed on ubuntu yet, can i use it to install grub on my new installed partition?
[05:57] <jimmygoon> KevinO, or try going to http://64.233.169.104 in firefox and see if anything comes up
[05:57] <nickrud> !grub | m0u5e this has instructions
[05:57] <ubotu> m0u5e this has instructions: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[05:57] <KevinO> jimmygoon: i cannot ping that address the first thiing i noticed that was weird is that the computer im on now has a gateway of 192.168.1.1, but my router is 192.168.0.1
[05:57] <marx2k> Dan2552: Yeah.. when I plug it into my linux box, it crashes the box! no joke
[05:57] <nickrud> DShepherd: I don't think I'll ever forget it
[05:57] <riotkittie> jumbers: audacious is similar to XMMS but is still being actively worked on
[05:58]  * DanaG uses Amarok.
[05:58] <jimmygoon> Kevin0 is that pc plugged directly into the router?
[05:58] <J-_> Can I use the epiphany sidebar to put bookmarks in via epilicious?
[05:58] <ctothej> after the upgrade to gutsy, my computer is slow... what is going on?
[05:58] <dystopianray> amarok is the best
[05:58] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, one ethernet card only?
[05:58] <Dan2552> marx2k: heh. Unlucky I guess. I'd advise getting bluetooth and a wii mote ;)
[05:58] <marx2k> so thats why Im wondering if the new updated kernel supports it now
[05:58] <captlloyd> I have the amd64 gutsy ISO downloaded, I would like to upgrade from feisty from that ISO.  There is no cdromupgrade script in the ISO. when I do an apt-get dist-upgrade it just tells me there are no packages to upgrade. If run update manager it will allow me to do the upgrade over the net. I do have the ISO mounted and is in my sources.list
[05:58] <akincer> or just download super grub and fix it immediately
[05:58] <DShepherd> nickrud, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/+bug/151045 & https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/+bug/151045/comments/ - that solve the libxml2 error
[05:58] <KevinO> jimmygoon: and the pc having the problems wont work on any gateway setting
[05:58] <jumbers> riotkittie: Is it somewhat minimalistic like XMMS? Because I don't want to deal with full screen interfaces and whatnot
[05:58] <marx2k> Dan2552: Thats $$$$
[05:58] <nickrud> DShepherd: not one of my most happy experiences. Things ok now?
[05:58] <Vlet> secret901: you could try apt-get autoremove
[05:58] <secret901> ctothej: it's probably using the fancy compiz effects
[05:58] <tux97> so log out of my username and then login to root and i should be fine to upgrade?
[05:58] <KevinO> jimmygoon: yes they are both plugged into the router
[05:58] <Dan2552> marx2k: but its good $$$
[05:58] <secret901> Vlet: tried that, there's nothing to uninstall
[05:58] <marx2k> I might just USB-hack my extra xbox controllers
[05:58] <riotkittie> jumbers: yes. it's nearly identical to xmms.
[05:58] <jimmygoon> KevinO, are you specifying those gateway settings?
[05:58] <stan_ley> jban: in terminal [ sudo lsusb -v | grep iProduct ] it tells the products, if the headphones are there, then it is alsamixer
[05:58] <ctothej> secret901: no compiz effect here
[05:58] <jumbers> riotkittie: Oh, fantastic
[05:59] <punsad> mouse: what os'es are insdtalled on the box alread?
[05:59] <DShepherd> nickrud, well after a reinstall and installation of some programs I got into some problems. Not sure why.
[05:59] <MoLerner> "The Composite extension is not available" what does that mean?
[05:59] <J-_> my usb hacked xbox controller works wonders.
[05:59] <Jban> stan_ley: type in what exactly, can you put everything in (  )
[05:59] <Dan2552> marx2k: a wii mote controlled media center would be perfect
[05:59] <secret901> ctothej: System->Preferences->appearance
[05:59] <marx2k> Dan2552: Yeah itd be even better if I had a WII :)
[05:59] <secret901> ctothej: make sure it's not enabled
[05:59] <nickrud> DShepherd: automatix ?!
[05:59] <riotkittie> J-_: congrats
[05:59] <marx2k> Right now my modded xbox serves as a media center via XBMC - does 1080i and everything :)
[05:59] <stan_ley> jban: follow me to #stan
[06:00] <DShepherd> nickrud, nope. i dont use that thing. never did. never will
[06:00] <KevinO> jimmygoon: the pc with problems has eth0 and eth1 (gigabyte) neither of them work, yes i specified the gateway settings.
[06:00] <Vlet> secret901: not sure then
[06:00] <poter_h> hi
[06:00] <c_lisp> marx2k I love smbing to my xbmc!1
[06:00] <akincer> Anyone else find the Screens and Graphics utility as worthless as I have with an Nvidia chipset?
[06:00] <johnchia> marx2k: how does it handle 1080i?
[06:00] <bo2> is there an alternative irc client
[06:00] <c_lisp> :P
[06:00] <J-_> riotkittie: hmm I guess... =)
[06:00] <bo2> something thats similar to mirc
[06:00] <Dan2552> marx2k: you complain about $$$ yet you have HD
[06:00] <riotkittie> bo2: alternative to what?
[06:00] <marx2k> john,  very nicely
[06:00] <c_lisp> I can't get mugen to work on my xbox :(
[06:00] <nickrud> DShepherd: hm, odd you had something in local then. Never woulda thought of that.
[06:00] <marx2k> Dan2552, dude, the HD is WHY I have no $$$
[06:00] <jscinoz> Hey guys, i dont know what i did but i can nolonger use SSH, i type the command, and nothing happens, if i type it with the verbose flag it says "ssh: hostnamehere: name or service not known" it does this for any server, how can i fix this?
[06:00] <riotkittie> bo2: oh. uhmmm xchat's probably the closest thing.
[06:00] <secret901> bo2: you can use xchat or Pidgin
[06:00] <punsad> m0u5e: I think it will all work if you install ubuntu last
[06:00] <marx2k> c_lisp: indeed! I just wish I could figure out how to get the emulators to SMB roms into it
[06:00] <ctothej> secret901: was set to 'none'
[06:00] <jimmygoon> KevinO, um... if you set it to dhcp ... then it shouldn't even let you put in a gateway address
[06:00] <Dan2552> marx2k: haha. Well it's not like wii is uber expensive
[06:00] <nickrud> DShepherd: but I wish I had
[06:01] <stan_ley> jban: in this window type ( /j stan)
[06:01] <KevinO> jscinoz:  you have to use something like ssh user@IP
[06:01] <Lilacor> where can I find more information about using KVM + Gutsy? I am not too keen on KVM's syntax....
[06:01] <DShepherd> nickrud, yeah but i am not sure what put it there..
[06:01] <Lilacor> !kvm
[06:01] <marx2k> Dan2552, I blew my wad on this Toshiba 65" :)
[06:01] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kvm - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[06:01] <jscinoz> Kevin0, tried, same result
[06:01] <riotkittie> bo2: die-hard mirc fans have been known to run it in WINE, but i'm not sure going to that length is really worth it
[06:01] <marx2k> (And an XBox 360)
[06:01] <andersbr> jscinoz: Sounds like a wider networking problem.  Can you ssh by IP address?
[06:01] <nickrud> DShepherd: about the only way would be if you compiled something
[06:01] <c_lisp> marx2k I don't think you can smb roms on it you have to put them ont he harddrive
[06:01] <KevinO> jimmygoon: no your right, im saying that i specify when i tried static
[06:01] <scguy318> riotkittie: its not really that hard :P
[06:01] <DShepherd> nickrud, it said the files were install 19 of Oct and 10 am. something put it there..
[06:01] <c_lisp> I have about 30,000 roms on mine
[06:01] <VelvetHog> Problem: This is a fresh install. The very first I tried to do is install the restricted nvidia driver via the handy wizard. I restart and get a black screen ("frequency out of range") instead of the graphical logon screen. I ran 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' to set my driver back to nv and noticed that it IS detecting my graphics card and monitor correctly.
[06:01] <Dan2552> marx2k: you know, you probably paid more on that than i've earned in my entire life
[06:01] <marx2k> c_lisp yeah I hate that... even though the emulators HAVE an smb option
[06:01] <bo2> does ubuntu require firewalls and av to stay safe
[06:01] <DShepherd> nickrud, no i didnt compile anything
[06:01] <scguy318> bo2: nope
[06:01] <marx2k> c_lisp: I havethe stock hard drive so no room for that many roms
[06:02] <riotkittie> scguy318: i'm sure that it's not. but. for an irc client? ugh ;P
[06:02] <c_lisp> I wish all the emulators had netplay
[06:02] <bo2> ok
[06:02] <bo2> so
[06:02] <nickrud> DShepherd: hm, the default configure command puts things in local ... Wierd
[06:02] <jscinoz> andersbr, no same error, i can ping the server and confirm its online though.
[06:02] <marx2k> Dan2552, believe me, I feel the pinch
[06:02] <c_lisp> killer intinct would of been nice with net play :P
[06:02] <bo2> online shopping shouldnt be a problem?
[06:02] <DShepherd> nickrud, i dont think so either
[06:02]  * riotkittie hugs irssi
[06:02] <scguy318> !firewall | bo2
[06:02] <ubotu> bo2: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[06:02] <secret901> jscinoz: try apt-get install ssh
[06:02] <scguy318> !av | bo2
[06:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about av - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[06:02] <scguy318> !antivirus | bo2
[06:02] <ubotu> bo2: antivirus is something you don't really need on Linux, unless you serve windows clients. ClamAV and aegis are decent linux virusscanners. Also see !linuxvirus
[06:02]  * nickrud likes software, doesn't love it ;p
[06:02] <DShepherd> nickrud, i install some apps from getdeb.. skype.
[06:02] <jimmygoon> KevinO, disable both ehternet cards in the gnome interface, and then turn eth0 back on, let it "apply" the settings and then check and make sure it is set to dhcp, close it, restart pc
[06:02] <jscinoz> secret901, with --reinstall flag?
[06:02] <MoLerner> Trying to make a normal appearance: "The Composite extension is not available" what does that mean?
[06:02] <punsad> bo2: there's a good article on debian-administration.org about the actual necessity of firewalls
[06:02] <marx2k> but since I haxx0r'd DishNET, my girlfriend loves me more now :) :)
[06:02] <DShepherd> nickrud, could be one of those i guess
[06:02] <punsad> for newbies, it's a good idea
[06:02] <jimmygoon> KevinO, I know the restart seems silly but gnome needs it sometimes, I'm convinced
[06:03] <Dan2552> marx2k: maybe its best not to get a wii, dont want to go throwing wii motes at the screen :p
[06:03] <nickrud> DShepherd: could be that. Using non-standard install locations is a hallmark of bad packaging
[06:03] <bo2> umm
[06:03] <marx2k> Dan: Well, that and Wii doesnt do 1080
[06:03] <secret901> jscinoz: if it's already installed, uninstalling and reinstalling might do the trick
[06:03] <bo2> what does it mean to serve a windows client
[06:03] <jimmygoon> MoLerner, it means your pc is probably old and you can't have compiz effects
[06:03] <derrrface> crdlb: still not working
[06:03] <jscinoz> alright give me a min
[06:03] <DShepherd> nickrud, yeah.. tell me about it
[06:03] <c_lisp> all my systems are modded except ps3
[06:03] <c_lisp> I don't play my wii much
[06:03] <MoLerner> it isn't old!
[06:03] <jscinoz> over my ISP's bandwidth limit for the month (pathetic 12gb) and have dialup speeds >_< 656kb ssh package = long time
[06:03] <marx2k> I dont want to mod my 360...spent too much on it to mess that up
[06:03] <Dan2552> my only modded console is my DS
[06:04] <MoLerner> jimmygoon it's crappy, but it's not old
[06:04] <DShepherd> nickrud, anyways just letting you know so next time i come back with this error :-) you will know the fix
[06:04] <jimmygoon> MoLerner, it means your graphics card might be lame
[06:04] <bo2> umm
[06:04] <jimmygoon> MoLerner, same thing :D
=== amen is now known as muhdazmil
[06:04] <jscinoz> wii is awesome, so many awesome games coming out soon
[06:04] <MoLerner> aww
[06:04] <bo2> add/remove apps is non responsive
[06:04] <bo2> how to i end it
[06:04] <Dan2552> jscinoz: metroid :D
[06:04] <captlloyd> When I run apt-get dist-upgrade, I get Calculating upgrade... Done  0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[06:04] <punsad> bo2: e.g. if windo user  ssh'es to a linux ssh server
[06:04] <c_lisp> my 360 modded just don't do the dvd rom hack I still can play online and all with backups
[06:04] <jscinoz> yep
[06:04] <nickrud> DShepherd: just reminds me to relearn how to identify what library is being called, and especially, avoid tunnel vision ;)
[06:04] <secret901> Does Gutsy support outputting to TV with the Intel 945 card?
[06:04] <riotkittie> oooh. i wish i could bring myself to delete my XP partition but i'm not sure i'm sold on vmware. and when i installed vmware server on my last install, it left junk everywhere.
[06:04] <jscinoz> USA has it already but us aussies gotta wait
[06:04] <captlloyd> Anyone know why this might happen?
[06:04] <bo2> oh
[06:04] <bo2> well
[06:04] <Dan2552> super smash bros not coming out till ages in europe though >:(
[06:04] <bo2> this is basic pc usage
[06:04] <marx2k> c_lisp: and not get banned? impressive
[06:04] <bo2> got tired of windows spyware
[06:04] <dystopianray> captlloyd: it means you are fully up to date
[06:05] <BaD-CrC> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1133/  <-- help?
[06:05] <bo2> so switched to linux
[06:05] <c_lisp> yep www.sell.com has them modded games have stealth patches
[06:05] <jscinoz> c_lisp how do you mod a 360 and not get banned from XBL? are there stealth mods now?
[06:05] <c_lisp> u can get games from ps2cat
[06:05] <DShepherd> nickrud, if we had identifed that i guess my upgrade would have gone thru fine. oh well you live and you learn
[06:05] <jimmygoon> riotkittie, thats why you use virtualbox or pirate vmware workstation.. I didn't liek the server one but workstation is okay
[06:05] <c_lisp> jscinoz yea
[06:05] <captlloyd> dystopianray: so how do I upgrade to to gutsy? I have the ISO mounted and added as a package source
[06:05] <simplyubuntu> has anyone here ussed the alternate install cd to install??
[06:05] <bo2> brb for reboot
[06:05] <jscinoz> all they need now is a firmware downgrade to the exploited one
[06:05] <marx2k> I have unlimited bandwidth/download from a gigantic newsfeed :D
[06:05] <dystopianray> riotkittie: virtualbox is very good and is in the gutsy repos
[06:05] <dystopianray> captlloyd: you can't upgrade with only the cd
[06:06] <jimmygoon> riotkittie, and I have it set up to where I can dual boot or use the vmware for the same copy .. you have to be careful when setting it up though, if you accidently boot linux while its running in the vm or w/e, you get major... majoor problems
[06:06] <jscinoz> hmm we have an ubuntu for ps3, we need an ubuntu for 360 :P
[06:06] <punsad> a well configured windows box shouldn't have problems with spyware.  If you aren't savvy enough to keep spyware of your windows box, you *might* find some challenges every now and then if you become an exclusive linux user
[06:06] <Dan2552> wii need a ubuntu for the wii
[06:06] <marx2k> Id like to be able to SMB movies onto my 360
[06:06] <jscinoz> c_lisp what is the name of the particular mod you have?
[06:06] <c_lisp> lol I put ubuntu on my ps3 it was so slow it was unbarable
[06:06] <nickrud> !offtopic
[06:06] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[06:06] <jscinoz> Dan2552, but no one has found a way to run arbitary code on the wii yet
[06:06] <jscinoz> c_lisp, yeah, no 3d accel, and only acess to 1 of 8 cores i think
[06:07] <captlloyd> dystopianray: Ahh, is there a way I can make it download the packages from the CD so I don't have to download 900MB?  If i have it added as a source and start the upgrade from update-manager, will it get the packages from there?
[06:07] <Dan2552> jscinoz: I don't see why though, they have the warez running on it
[06:07] <c_lisp> yea Modded Xbox 360 Premium w/ Stealth I-Xtreme 1.2 + 6
[06:07] <jscinoz> damn hypervisor shit
[06:07] <riotkittie> i'll look into virtualbox. thanks dystopianray and jimmygoon.
[06:07] <dystopianray> jscinoz: 7 of 8 SPEs
[06:07] <jimmygoon> jscinoz, ubuntu on 360 has already been done...
[06:07] <jscinoz> dan2552, you mean pirated discs?
[06:07] <simplyubuntu> i need to know why the upgrade wants to download files even though i said not to! help!
[06:07] <Dan2552> yes
[06:07] <dystopianray> riotkittie: virtualbox is open source as well, i highly recomend it
=== dmx is now known as _Christian
[06:07] <jscinoz> jimmygoon, O_o just use the PPC disk? or a special kernel?
[06:07] <jimmygoon> jscinoz, just with the old kernel version, but they have some interesting new developments on various fronts
[06:07] <c_lisp> my free does them and sell them no sell.com buster
[06:07] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: because you have apps that require stuff that's not on the cd
[06:07] <secret901> simplyubuntu: are you using an alternate install disk?
[06:07] <marx2k> c-lisp: do you have a dual layer burner or something?
[06:07] <dystopianray> captlloyd: i'm not sure
[06:07]  * DanaG ponders doing 
[06:07] <jimmygoon> jscinoz, its a very large process, not officially supported by ms or anyone
[06:07] <jscinoz> no shit :P
[06:08] <c_lisp> naw I buy mine from my a guy online for 5 dollars each
[06:08] <jimmygoon> jscinoz, and if you've ever put your 360 on the net it has auto updated and you can't so :P
[06:08] <DanaG> sed -i 's/gutsy/hardy/' /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:08] <KevinO> jimmygoon:  great now i am back up with dhcp, whats the best way to go to static now?
[06:08] <captlloyd> dystopianray: Ok, I'll keep trying, haven't found much help through google.
[06:08] <DanaG> should I do it?
[06:08] <marx2k> oh 'freal?! nice
[06:08] <jscinoz> we need a completly open console :P
[06:08] <marx2k> I want to play some Katamari
[06:08] <simplyubuntu> hmmm and thats unavoidable? even if i plug out my eth cable?
[06:08] <KevinO> jimmygoon:  and shouldnt my gateways match?
[06:08] <jimmygoon> KevinO, if you don't mind me asking why do you need static?
[06:08] <MSTK> is there a special channel for help with Gutsy upgrades?
[06:08] <BlackCow> so im really scratching my head here, im trying to install teamspeak server, I created a new user called teamspeak and set a password, i type su teamspeak and give the correct password but it dosnt do anything, what could be going wrong
[06:08] <nickrud> Dan2552: lol, no, probably aren't even any hardy repos filled yet. Wait a month
[06:08] <riotkittie> MSTK: you're in it. :x
[06:08] <dystopianray> jscinoz: you want the GP32X
[06:08] <KevinO> jimmygoon: im trying to set up synergy
[06:08] <MSTK> riotkittie: heh, thanks.
[06:08] <jscinoz> i know about that, but i mean a home console, something more powerful
[06:08] <LordLimecat> 2 questions
[06:08] <Dan2552> nickrud: i didnt say anything about repos
[06:09] <secret901> MSTK: there used to be #ubuntu+1 but it now redirects here
[06:09] <punsad> KevinO: synergy is good stuff

[06:09] <DanaG> There are new versions of GCC, but that's about it.

[06:09] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, modern day routers always give a pc the same ip address... they have "smart-dhcp"
[06:09] <Dan2552> woah net split?
[06:09] <jscinoz> i wish sony wern't so tight-arsed about their consoles, we had to fight tooth and nail to get homebrew on psp, and now we have to find a way to break the hypervisor on the ps3 for good stuff
[06:09] <scguy318> no
[06:09] <nickrud> Dan2552: srry, bad tab completion
[06:09] <jscinoz> Yay Seveas
[06:09] <LordLimecat> A), would i be correct in assuming rm -rf /proc/* would restart linux
[06:09] <scguy318> i knew there was something going on when 5 users joined at the same time
[06:10] <punsad>           #ubuntu
[06:10] <MSTK> pretty much...i have no windows manger under gutsy
[06:10] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, modern day routers always give a pc the same ip address... they have "smart-dhcp"
[06:10]  * nickrud wonders if seveas ever sleeps
[06:10] <voidmage> did a change to youtube break flash in firefox?
[06:10] <MSTK> so none of the menu bars for any windows show up
[06:10] <MSTK> and I can't use basic functions such as minimize all to desktop
[06:10] <jscinoz> Anyone know if azureus is going to be updated now that gutsy is out? we still have 2.50 super buggy edition
[06:10] <DanaG> I had a Netgear WGR614 that would give me the same address always:
[06:10] <scguy318> voidmage: in Gnash probably, in restricted Flash no
[06:10] <jscinoz> need 2.5.0.4 :P
[06:10] <punsad> LordLimecat: that would screw up the system bad I would think
[06:10] <DanaG> None at all.
[06:10] <TwoD> ***nickrud, hey, thanks for your help before! I got it all working =)
[06:10] <MSTK> i tried sudo apt-get install beryl, but it seems to no longer be a valid package
[06:11] <nickrud> TwoD: yw ;)
[06:11] <Rich4> Amarok won't stay closed. Any way to fix?
[06:11] <jimmygoon> MSTK, alt-f2 and type "metacity --replace"
[06:11] <voidmage> scguy318: weird, i just tried youtube embedded with restricted flash
[06:11] <nickrud> MSTK: try alt-f2  emerald --replace
[06:11] <voidmage> made the page "unresponsive"
[06:11] <MSTK> thanks, I'll try that.
[06:11] <dystopianray> scguy318: youtue works for me in firefox
[06:11] <TwoD> Only problem I have now is that the Appearance Preferences window doesn't update :/
[06:11] <marx2k> hmm just use Azureu's autoupdate feature
[06:11] <jimmygoon> youtube is rolling out a new interface for their player
[06:11] <nickrud> I'm the optomist ;:)
[06:11] <scguy318> dystopianray: me too, voidmage has the issue
[06:11] <jimmygoon> nothing too bad I thought
[06:11] <djlenoir> oh sweet! i finally stumbled upon a forum thread that gave me the answer i needed to get my bluetooth keyboard and mouse working... even after a reboot! = happiness! :)
[06:11] <scguy318> jimmygoon: isn't that old news?
[06:11] <DanaG> I did the sed command and updated (not upgrade), and I see lots of gcc updates.
[06:12] <jimmygoon> scguy318, yes?
[06:12] <nickrud> DanaG: they must be planning a new toolchain for the lts
[06:12] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, either way, if you really want static, the gateway ip = router ip... the ip address should be just like the router except the last part should be a number between 2-200 and the other one is 255.255.255.0
[06:13] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, the best thing to do is to run "ifconfig eth0" in a terminal, and copy the info out of there to fill in the boxes for the static ip
[06:13] <jimmygoon> KevinO, then you are using settings that you know shoudl work
[06:13] <rayb0t> some routers let you assign IP addresses to MAC addresses, which is kinda convenient sometimes
[06:13] <jimmygoon> rayb0t, most do it behind the scenes anyway
[06:13] <MSTK> thanks...switching to metacity seems to work
[06:13] <MSTK> but how do I get beryl back, now?
[06:13] <jimmygoon> my laptop always gets .76, etc
[06:13] <MSTK> has the process changed since Fiesty?
[06:14] <djlenoir> now a simple question... how do you delete an icon that is left over in the Applications --> Internet menu list after the program was removed?
[06:14] <jscinoz> damn aussie isps
[06:14] <_blitz_> checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
[06:14] <jimmygoon> MSTK, um since its install by default, yes
[06:14] <_blitz_> checking for c++... no
[06:14] <_blitz_> checking for g++... no
[06:14] <_blitz_> checking for gcc... gcc
[06:14] <_blitz_> checking whether the C++ compiler (gcc  ) works... no
[06:14] <_blitz_> configure: error: installation or configuration problem: C++ compiler cannot create executables.
[06:14] <MSTK> djlenoir - alacarte, if i recall
[06:14] <dystopianray> _blitz_: do you have build-essential?
[06:14] <jimmygoon> MSTK, "compiz --replace" should work though
[06:14] <nickrud> djlenoir: it should have been removed automatically; if not, look for the right one in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications
[06:14] <MSTK> jimmygoon - i had beryl, and then I upgraded and my windows manager swithced it "unknown" and i had pretty much none to speak of
[06:14] <simplyubuntu> nickrun?
[06:14] <KevinO> jimmygoon: i changed the routers gateway to 192.168.1.1, i think that was causing the issue cause i just set the pc to static and it works now
[06:15] <jimmygoon> erm, you install beryl manually?
[06:15] <simplyubuntu> i mean nickrud
[06:15] <djlenoir> nickrud, thank you
[06:15] <jimmygoon> why did you change the gw?
[06:15] <KevinO> jimmygoon: thanks for your help man
[06:15] <jscinoz> Seveas, the falcon deb in your feisty repo is broken :(
=== funy_girl is now known as think_5
[06:15] <jimmygoon> KevinO, what do you mean you change the gateway? oh, if you've got tit :P
[06:15] <Jban> Hey guys, I have an USB Audio Laptop question: My Logitech USB Headset is recognised in Ubuntu7.10, and I have the Sound Device selected as my USB Headset in Sound Options.... but my YouTube videos and like my DVD movie playing now, all put sound through the laptop speakers.  Skype / Pidgin however, use the headset.  help?
[06:15] <MSTK> jimmygoon - any way to get beryl onto my system.  automatically or not.
[06:15] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: yes?
[06:15] <KevinO> jimmygoon: cause they didnt match
[06:15] <stan_ley> Q: ( lsof -i ) can i limit to only 1 instance of process ?
[06:15] <jimmygoon> KevinO, enjoy synergy... it pretty much rocks! :)
[06:15] <stan_ley> output
[06:15] <jimmygoon> MSTK, in gutsy? its installed out of box
[06:15] <think_5> ghj
[06:15] <KevinO> gateways are supposed to match right?
[06:15] <Zaerath> Blah.
[06:15] <simplyubuntu> uh i just wanna know if i can avoid having to download anything *during* the upgrade
[06:15] <simplyubuntu> that possible?
[06:16] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, I really don't know what you mean by match
[06:16] <jimmygoon> match where?
[06:16] <stan_ley> simplyubuntu: what!!
[06:16] <`eric-> hey where do programs get installed?
[06:16] <KevinO> the static computer and the router its connected too
[06:16] <MSTK> jimmygoon - I thought so, too.  but after i upgraded, it seems to have exploded.
[06:16] <jimmygoon> MSTK, I'm sorry. I'm making the mistake of thinking beryl = compiz.fusion
[06:16] <stan_ley> `eric- ; wherever u want them to
[06:16] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: not really. a release needs to be upgraded as a whole, not piecemeal
[06:16] <simplyubuntu> stan_ley, i was trying to get anyone's attention but i felt about *this* small
[06:16] <simplyubuntu> :(
[06:16] <voidmage> wow.
[06:16] <stan_ley> lol
[06:16] <kd7swh> Is the defualt shell in gusty still dash?
[06:16] <usser> `eric-: they usually spread all across the system
[06:16] <jimmygoon> ubuntu gutsy has compiz fusion out of box
[06:16] <jimmygoon> beryl is dead
[06:16] <jimmygoon> it remerged with compiz(-fustion)
[06:17] <voidmage> ever since today (which i'll probably attribute to youtube's changes)
[06:17] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: told you that already ;)
[06:17] <jimmygoon> KevinO, the gatewayo n the PC = the router IP
[06:17] <MSTK> jimmygoon - i never really understood the beryl-compiz merger. so now they are synonymous?
[06:17] <voidmage> firefox has been a whole lot less stable
[06:17] <simplyubuntu> so, say if i unplug my ethernet cable or turn of my router, will it skip downloading?
[06:17] <usser> `eric-: executables usually go to /usr/bin, program libraries to /usr/lib
[06:17] <jimmygoon> aka... gateway = 192.168.0.1
[06:17] <jimmygoon> MSTK, kinda
[06:17] <KevinO> oh crap
[06:17] <stan_ley> simplyubuntu: it wont upgrade unless u tell it to!
[06:17] <petru> helo!
[06:17] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: yes, but you'll most likely end up with a borked or broken install
[06:17] <jimmygoon> there was compiz.... then compiz-quinn, then compiz & beryl and now they've remerged into compiz-fusion
[06:17] <`eric-> usser: well, i installed it via apt-get... where would it be insatlled?
[06:18] <KevinO> jimmygoon: i totally forgot that
[06:18] <stan_ley> simplyubuntu: wat are u trying to do or not do watever the case may be ?
[06:18]  * KevinO slaps himself in the face WAKE UP!!!
[06:18] <kd7swh> does anyone know if the defualt shell in gusty still dash?
[06:18] <jimmygoon> MSTK, they're not synonymous persay, they are still "sepeate" though beryl is discontinued as far as I know... but compiz-fusion is the future as far as I understand
[06:18] <petru> hello! i can not play any kind of movies with mplayer. running ubuntu 7.04, with latest update
[06:18] <usser> `eric-: as i said exe's in /usr/bin libs /usr/lib/programname
[06:18] <usser> `eric-: config files go into /etc
[06:18] <fabio> bom dia pessoal
[06:18] <nickrud> `eric-: dpkg -L <pkgname> shows where all the files went
[06:18] <akincer> kd7swh: surely you mean bash
[06:18] <LiMaO> fabio: bom dia, mas speak english
[06:18] <jimmygoon> Kevin0, its okay. It would explain your problems...
[06:19] <zyxnull> petru: Maybe a codecs problem?
[06:19] <dga> when gnome-screensaver starts to kick in, i get "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-Misc" missing on display ":1.0"." anyone know what this is?
[06:19] <simplyubuntu> stan_ley, im trying to upgrade my computer using the alternate cd, but without having to download anything *during* the upgrade
[06:19] <jimmygoon> akincer, I thought they switched to dash
[06:19] <petru> hello! i can not play any kind of movies with mplayer. running ubuntu 7.04, with latest update. please. help.
[06:19] <zyxnull> petru: try Automatix (if law allows that on your side of the world)
[06:19] <akincer> not on my comp
[06:19] <petru> zyxnull, what kind of codecs should i use/
[06:19] <Jban> Hey guys, I have an USB Audio Laptop question: My Logitech USB Headset is recognised in Ubuntu7.10, and I have the Sound Device selected as my USB Headset in Sound Options.... but my YouTube videos and like my DVD movie playing now, all put sound through the laptop speakers.  Skype / Pidgin however, use the headset.  help?
[06:19] <jscinoz> argh i want to make a repo with falcon, but after doing an export, the pages are empty >_<
[06:19] <hydrogen> automatix is bad.
[06:19] <hydrogen> !automatix
[06:19] <ubotu> Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.  A creditable analysis from a debian/ubuntu developer is here - http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html (Additional information: /msg ubotu worksforme)
[06:19] <kd7swh> akincer: dash is a lightweight cop-out of bash that was in edgy, does gusty go back to using the full bash shell?
[06:19] <aquagrunty> petru: have you tried vlc?
[06:19] <DanaG> Is anybody going to make an compiz-fusion unofficial-plugins repo for Gutsy?
[06:20] <zyxnull> petru: go to the automatix site, http://www.getautomatix.com/
[06:20] <stan_ley> simpyubuuntu: oh, i tried that a while back, broke my system, it might work for u. if u have all the necessary dependencies in cd
[06:20] <hydrogen> kd7swh: err, dash is the default rescue shell.. all veresions afaik have had bash
[06:20] <jimmygoon> DanaG, does trevino not have one up yet?
[06:20] <DanaG> I don't know, actually.
[06:20] <zyxnull> petru: install the tool, then install the codec software, that'll solve the problem
[06:20] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: why exactly are you not wanting to download stuff?
[06:20] <jimmygoon> DanaG, let me chekc, I suspect he does
[06:20] <akincer> I'm aware of dash, but bash is my shell and this is a fresh install as of about 30 minutes ago
[06:20] <hydrogen> kd7swh: the "default shell" is a fairly misleading term
[06:20] <stan_ley> nickrud: cause he's reTaDed
[06:20] <akincer> or an hour or so
[06:20] <hydrogen> kd7swh: /bin/sh is still dash..
[06:21] <jimmygoon> gah, torrents eating too much bw
[06:21] <petru> thanks everybody!
[06:21] <simplyubuntu> but see i dont get this: if the upgrade were to download *anything*, even if it were for only my extra packages,. there wouldnt be 1400 files!
[06:21] <hydrogen> kd7swh: but, if you want bash you run it as /bin/bash.. oddly enough
[06:21] <zafar> i can anyone  help to upgrade my kubuntu 7.04 to 7.10
[06:21] <aquagrunty> petru: if you are using compiz (appearence-> something other then "normal settings") you probably have to change the output
[06:21] <fabio> any one know a beter software than wine?
[06:21] <DanaG> I hope that has-a-traffic-limit ISP doesn't advertise "unlimited".
[06:21] <kd7swh> hydrogen: point taken, and thanks for the ln
[06:21] <dystopianray> fabio: maybe cedega or crossover
[06:21] <stan_ley> fabio: BEER !
[06:21] <iobelisk> how do i change keymap settings for X?
[06:21] <nickrud> stan_ley: usually people have reasons, but simplyubuntu that's about right, you'd be suprised at how granular ubuntu packaging is
[06:21] <TwoD> Anyone who knows what's wrong when the Appearance Preferences window doesn't update?
[06:21] <jimmygoon> fabio, what do you mean a better software? there is vmware, a full blown emulator, but it is slower and uses more memory
[06:21] <simplyubuntu> nickrud, because i live in pakistan and it takes me about 11 hours to download 700 mb!
[06:21] <puff> I'm working on a debian box that was set up by an extremely security-conscious admin.  One of the things he left out was /usr/sbin/sendmail, which an application uses to send email.
[06:21] <usser> fabio: cedega is for games, crossover for general programs
[06:21] <mooma> A question/comment. Upgrading to Gutsy all was going fine until I walked away while the new packages were being installed & the screen-saver asked for a password. I typed in my password multiple times and the machine would not log me in. I ended up having to go into a root term and using dpkg to get to a stable environment. The question I guess is what messed up the password?
[06:21] <meoblast001> hello
[06:21] <zyxnull> fabio: What you want to do? gamming, office?
[06:21] <KevinO> jimmygoon: so what should my routers gateway be?
[06:22] <puff> Whoops, I'm on #ubuntu.  Dangit.
[06:22] <puff> Sorry.
[06:22] <youBun2> how do i change what uname provides as a host's network name
[06:22] <petru> aquagrunty, thats it! i got a output error. how to change that?
[06:22] <bally> hi!! i have HP pavilion dv6000 series.....my board is NVIDIA.... i m unable to connect to internet.. unable to configure my lan card....unable to configure my voice and uanble to play movies.....
[06:22] <jimmygoon> KevinO, what do you mean... are you asking what your router ip is?
[06:22] <akincer> kd7swh: Applications > Accessories > Terminal and type ? hit enter at the command prompt. You should get bash: ?: command not found
[06:22] <akincer> cheap trick
[06:22] <fabio> gamming
[06:22] <aquagrunty> petru: if you have the mplayer GUI, right click->preferences->video tab
[06:22] <fabio> i have the wine
[06:22] <aquagrunty> petru: change it to X11
[06:22] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: ah. A very good reason. I lived at the bottom of a tiny pipe also, had to run the install over a couple of nights.
[06:22] <venomousice> what are the command line apps for working with cd isos and burning?
[06:22] <fabio> and works good
[06:22] <DanaG> Heh, I love this post:
[06:22] <Dan2552> fabio: you'll be disappointed with commercial games in linux
[06:22] <fabio> but in gta it slow
[06:22] <akincer> I've been drinking wine. Does that count?
[06:22] <aquagrunty> petru: same if your using VLC, you need to change the output thingy
[06:22] <DanaG>  				 				My Splashscreen is superglued to my Desktop
[06:22] <DanaG> Okay so I installed a splashscreen and it's superglued to my Desktop now, I can't get it off! I've tried using vinegar, bicard soda...everything...it just ruins my LCD screen...anybody know how I can get it off?
[06:22] <zyxnull> fabio: Why you don't try CEDEGA http://www.transgaming.com/
[06:22] <jimmygoon> fabio, you might want to look at cedega
[06:22] <DanaG> Heh heh.
[06:23] <dga> has anyone had problems with gnome-screensaver? it keeps telling me
[06:23] <dga> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-Misc" missing on display ":1.0".
[06:23] <KevinO> jimmygoon: no i know the ip of the router is set to 192.168.1.1, i need to know what to set the gateway too
[06:23] <simplyubuntu> so, nickrud, why would my computer want to download ALL the upgrades when ive given them to it on a bloody platter!
[06:23] <fabio> cedega have one problem
[06:23] <jimmygoon> DanaG, :O
[06:23] <fabio> the textures
[06:23] <jimmygoon> you need to know what to set the gateway to on ubuntu?
[06:23] <kd7swh> akincer: I see
[06:23] <iobelisk> how would i change keymap setting for X? the gnome settings have been overwritten so i cannot set keyboard thru systems>preferences
[06:23] <zafar> i have follow all steps as mentiond on web but it does now show any update
[06:23] <Jban> Hey guys, I have an USB Audio Laptop question: My Logitech USB Headset is recognised in Ubuntu7.10, and I have the Sound Device selected as my USB Headset in Sound Options.... but my YouTube videos and like my DVD movie playing now, all put sound through the laptop speakers.  Skype / Pidgin however, use the headset.  help?
[06:23] <stan_ley> vernimousice: burning --> cdrecord -v -pad FILE.iso
[06:23] <Dan2552> KevinO: I always put gateway as the same IP as my router, and it always works
[06:23] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: because they aren't all on the platter. If you installed any kde apps, for example, that will pull down a load of packages
[06:24] <bally> has anyone faced a problem wid nvidia... board...
[06:24] <KevinO> jimmygoon: i have a gateway setting in my router settings
[06:24] <jimmygoon> KevinO, I thought a few minutes ago your told me your router Ip address was 192.168.0.1 but maybe i'm switching numbers around
[06:24] <fabio> well any one have the lastest version of cedega?
[06:24] <jimmygoon> KevinO, leave it alone
[06:24] <zyxnull> fabio: Cedega isn't flawless, you should address the questions to the specific game on theri forums, maybe some of the gurus there can help
[06:24] <jimmygoon> KevinO, you shouldn't be touching that
[06:24] <zafar> i can anyone  help to upgrade my kubuntu 7.04 to 7.10 . i have follow all steps as mentiond on web but it does now show any update
[06:24] <simplyubuntu> exactly nickrud, but i bet at the bottom of your pipe you didnt have frequent power outages which have corrupted your install several times before, forccing a grown man to cry
[06:24] <simplyubuntu> :P
[06:24] <akincer> bally: I have no problems except if I try to use the Screens and Graphics tool. It is a total disaster
[06:24] <Dan2552> KevinO: if you mean ON your router settings, dont change that
[06:24] <Vlet> fabio: yeah, running wow in it now
[06:25] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: and possibly that list of 1400 might be misleading, apt doesn't differentiate between apps on the cd and on the net
[06:25] <KevinO> jimmygoon:  nope, it was 192.168.1.1, the gateway was /0.1
[06:25] <fabio> vlet
[06:25] <fabio> can u pass to me»
[06:25] <Vlet> fabio
[06:25] <Vlet> fabio: no
[06:25] <jimmygoon> KevinO, okay
[06:25] <KevinO> Dan2552: ok thanks
[06:25] <jimmygoon> well just leave your rotuer settings alone
[06:25] <Xerostyle> Hey everyone.
[06:25] <KevinO> thanks jimmygoon
[06:25] <fabio> ok
[06:25] <zyxnull> fabio: No warez here
[06:25] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: no, I did have a decent power grid ;)
[06:25] <jimmygoon> KevinO, yep
[06:25] <fabio> hehehe
[06:25] <simplyubuntu> hmm interesting... i DO have kubuntu and xubuntu installed :-[
[06:25] <Xerostyle> I got a question.
[06:25] <fabio> im sory
[06:25] <bodq> hi, I don't see my wacom tablet input devices in `xinput list`, although they're defined in xorg.conf and work :(
[06:25] <KevinO> i do not know why but synergy is still not working
[06:25] <bodq> any ideas how to debug it?
[06:25] <jimmygoon> fabio, I'm not allowed to suggest TPB
[06:25] <JW_704> Hello
[06:25] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: there you go, maybe uninstalling any apps you don't want will help.
[06:26] <simplyubuntu> yeah well you dont know how BLOODY lucky you were.. where was this, if i can ask?
[06:26] <Xerostyle> How do I make Gaim not beep when I backspace past the limit?
[06:26] <kd7swh> Jban, sounds like the apps are using different different drivers, some alsa some other drivers?
[06:26] <troxor> KevinO: what's going on?
[06:26] <JW_704> Can someone point me to the guide to install my ATI Radeon drivers on Ubuntu 7.04 please?
[06:26] <fabio> one more thing
[06:26] <stan_ley> GOOGLE.COM
[06:26] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: stickville, California
[06:26] <fabio> to instal the nvidia drivers
[06:26] <sparr> Xerostyle: i think theres a global prefs thing for gnome where you set event sounds, that would be one of them
[06:26] <luislo> Hi all, please help. I have a problem with the avant-window-navigator... so it seems like it "thinks" the bar is below, so it appears at the bottom of the screen, but leaving an empty space below it... a ny ideas on how to fix this?
[06:26] <Vlet> fabio: $5 is not hard to come by for gaming pleasure :)
[06:26] <fabio> i can instal with evel?
[06:26] <Dan2552> JW_704: maybe you should get 7.10
[06:26] <zyxnull> Xerostyle: <joke> cut the speaker cable </joke>
[06:26] <simplyubuntu> small town?
[06:26] <DanaG> Oh yeah, in the gnome weather applet, how do you set by zip code?
[06:27] <JW_704> Dan2552 why so?
[06:27] <nickrud> so small we were the only house for about 5 miles
[06:27] <DanaG> In my town, there are three or four zip codes with different microclimates.
[06:27] <zafar> i can anyone  help to upgrade my kubuntu 7.04 to 7.10 . i have follow all steps as mentiond on web but it does now show any update
[06:27] <CoasterMaster> DanaG, I believe it only works with places that have airports
[06:27] <Xerostyle> It's not the speaker.
[06:27] <nickrud> DanaG: you live in SF?
[06:27] <jimmygoon> DanaG, pssh
[06:27] <simplyubuntu> ouch.... im guessing dialup?
[06:27] <Dan2552> JW_704: on first bootup after install, it gives an option to install ATI driver automatically
[06:27] <DanaG> 934{0{1,5,7},10}
[06:27] <luislo> or how could I move the task bar to the bottom to see what happens.. I couldn't do it, so I just move it somewhere else...
[06:27] <SteamMachine> Hi all, I'd like to password protect some folders. I'd rather not create another user account - something graphical would be best.
[06:27] <Xerostyle> It's actually the internal beep thingie
[06:27] <DanaG> San Luis Obispo, actually.
[06:27] <DanaG> If you wanna get rid of pcspkr entirely, blacklist it.
[06:27] <JW_704> Dan2552, can I upgrade to 7.10?
[06:27] <jimmygoon> SteamMachine, encrypt or just password protect
[06:27] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: dialup, yes, about 3k. And We got local radio stations on the phone line :)
[06:28] <luislo> ?
[06:28] <stan_ley> GOOGLE.COM
[06:28] <kd7swh> Xerostyle wants to disable his pc speaker
[06:28] <jimmygoon> DanaG, :O tr3vino doesn't appear to have a gutsy repo yet :(
[06:28] <JW_704> How do I check my current Ubuntu version?
[06:28] <Dan2552> JW_704: I don't know about upgrading, a clean install would probably be best
[06:28] <DanaG> Bummer.
[06:28] <alecwh> I'm testing my some multimedia equipment, and right now i'm trying to see if my mic is working. How can I easily test if my mic is recieving input - live?
[06:28] <jimmygoon> stan_ley, why do you keep pasting that here?
[06:28] <SteamMachine> jimmygoon password protect
[06:28] <pupster> Hey guys, im trying to install a program (still, mx5000tools) I finally decided to try to install it on my older laptop (7.04 32bit) and worked fine .. however it does not work on my new 7.10 64 bit machine .. could it be related to the 32/64 bit?
[06:28] <joanki> i'm experiencing some pretty bad problems with my 7.10
[06:28] <nickrud> JW_704: lsb_release -a in a terminal
[06:28] <simplyubuntu> hey man at least you do
[06:28] <joanki> can anyone help m e
[06:28] <akincer> How about unhooking it from the motherboard
[06:28] <B_166-ER-X> I have a problem with Gutsy, when running Compiz, sometimes there is a window that 'burns' the screen, that stays on the screen whatever i do , can someone help?
[06:28] <fabio> Vlet see the pvt
[06:28] <stan_ley> jimmygoon: for noob Qs i keep seeing
[06:28] <jimmygoon> SteamMachine, i'm not sure how to do that
[06:28] <simplyubuntu> most of the time, the phone lines over here dont work either
[06:28] <joanki> that is hapening to me, too b_166
[06:28] <jimmygoon> stan_ley, :S
[06:28] <zyxnull> B_166-ER-X: Video card? driver?
[06:28] <MaTrIx-X> How can I forcefully remove a package that refuses? e.g. "sudo apt-get remove iscsitarget -y" yields "[: 142: ==: unexpected operator failed with reason :Connection refused." "invoke-rc.d: initscript iscsitarget, action "stop" failed." "Starting iSCSI enterprise target service: FATAL: Module iscsi_trgt not found."
[06:29] <joanki> how do i get the driver?
[06:29] <youBun2> how do i change what uname provides as my network name\
[06:29] <TwoD> Nobody's had any problems with the Appearance Preferences window?
[06:29] <nickrud> B_166-ER-X: right click the title bar, make sure it's not sticky (on all desktops)
[06:29] <joanki> TwoD: i do
[06:29] <zyxnull> hmmmm... <B_166-ER-X> isn't related to <MaTrIx-X>
[06:29] <luislo> Hi all, please help. I have a problem with the avant-window-navigator... so it seems like it "thinks" the bar is below, so it appears at the bottom of the screen, but leaving an empty space below it... a ny ideas on how to fix this?
[06:29] <jimmygoon> MaTrIx-X, you can try sudo aptitude purge <pkg_name>
[06:29] <TwoD> joanki: what kind of problems?
[06:29] <sparr> youBun2: /etc/hostname probably has something to do with it
[06:29] <stan_ley> man, i gotta sleep, its 1:30 AM here!!
[06:29] <simplyubuntu> ok nickrud... back to business.. can i cancel the upgrade while it's downloading safely?
[06:29] <fabio> linux sucks
[06:29] <fabio> hehe
[06:29] <luislo> I mean, it seems like I need to tell somehow gnome to move the taskbar somewhere else
[06:30] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: absolutely. It will pick up the download from where it left off. Did that a lot
[06:30] <Dan2552> stan_ley: its 6:30AM here... I need to go to bed :p
[06:30] <momdad> Does anyone know how I can disable xgl on startup??
[06:30] <Vlet> fabio: okay, any other questions?
[06:30] <troxor> momdad: appearance in preferences
[06:30] <B_166-ER-X> whu?
[06:30] <venomousice> im working on some cron jobs to do some automated backups each night to DVD-RW, but gnome is whining about mounts and the like. Is there any way to disable automounting of blank media like this? I don't think it's bothering anything but its just annoying
[06:30] <mtholdenss> are the ubuntu update servers down? i cant get the flash plugin or anything else installed
[06:30] <stan_ley> Dan2552: lol
[06:30] <MaTrIx-X> jimmygoon: no dice
[06:30] <stan_ley> venmousice: /etc/fstab
[06:30] <Dan2552> stan_ley: actually, thanks for reminding me, I will go to bed now
[06:30] <scguy318> mtholdenss: check your Software Sources: System -> Administration -> Software Sources, make sure they're all checked
[06:30] <simplyubuntu> ah i see.. thank you *very* much... i will do so and tell you what becomes of my oh-so-critical feisty box.
[06:31] <simplyubuntu> :D
[06:31] <[[Charlie]]> Feisty!?
[06:31] <[[Charlie]]> Gusty.
[06:31] <jimmygoon> MaTrIx-X, I must say, that sounded like a really crappy error msg
[06:31] <LiMaO> if anyone here needs help getting java + flash + mplayer fully working on a 64bit system, just let me know. i have a script that installs firefox 32bit + all the nice stuff. simple, user friendly and effective =D
[06:31] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: and you can invoke apt-get dist-upgrade --download-only to ensure it is only downloading
[06:31] <joanki> TwoD: well, for instance i get problems when i try to change the color layout
[06:31] <luislo> I mean, it seems like I need to tell somehow gnome to move the taskbar somewhere else
[06:31] <B_166-ER-X> zyxnull there is no title bar, sometime its just the shadow ofthe window, or half of the window...ect... happend with System messages, or like the 'empy recyle bin' messages
[06:31] <momdad> troxor im in kde desktop. xgl working here but not in gnome. Just get a white screen in gnome.
[06:31] <joanki> the colors don't change or the preference window freezes when i set it
[06:31] <MaTrIx-X> jimmygoon: yeah, I'm considering a fresh install over it --- really don't wanna have to do that again today
[06:31] <joanki> my computer won't hibernate in addition
[06:31] <Vlet> venomousice: load up the gconf editor, and search for 'mount' (search including values and keys) ... you'll see the relevant options
[06:31] <joanki> and when i got back to my computer afer it suspended, it crashed
[06:31] <LiMaO> i guess people never had that many problems with a release before =/
[06:31] <Jban> Hey guys, I have an USB Audio Laptop question: My Logitech USB Headset is recognised in Ubuntu7.10, and I have the Sound Device selected as my USB Headset in Sound Options.... but my YouTube videos and like my DVD movie playing now, all put sound through the laptop speakers.  Skype / Pidgin however, use the headset.  help?
[06:32] <luislo> Hi all, please help. I have a problem with the avant-window-navigator... so it seems like it "thinks" the bar is below, so it appears at the bottom of the screen, but leaving an empty space below it... a ny ideas on how to fix this? I mean, it seems like I need to tell somehow gnome to move the taskbar somewhere else
[06:32] <joanki> and when i just rebooted , there was a white bar in the middle of my screen  until it booted
[06:32] <troxor> momdad: hm, dunno for sure- check if there's something in ~/.kde/Autostart/
[06:32] <venomousice> Vlet: thanks
[06:32] <momdad> ok
[06:32] <stan_ley> GOODNIGHT ALL
[06:32] <jimmygoon> SteamMachine, It doesn't appear theres anyway that I can see of doing that... the proposal I saw used on the fly under covers encryption anyway... otherwise someone could just load up a live dis and read out the file anyway
[06:32] <B_166-ER-X> -zyxnull-  , hm, Nvidia Geforce 7300Gs 256 , With nvidia-glx-new
[06:33] <joanki> i have nvidia
[06:33] <[[Charlie]]> GOODNIGHT stan_ley
[06:33] <chalcedony> grep -i "objective" *servername.* | grep  What goes here? i want to look in logs for pvt msg and not channels
[06:33] <TwoD> joanki: My window is constantly frozen now, The buttons and tabs work since stuff happens, but it doesn't update visually so I'm making changes in the blind...
[06:33] <joanki> how do did you reboot?
[06:33] <joanki> i mean did
[06:33] <aquagrunty> TwoD: is your screen rotated?
[06:33] <joanki> not how i dunno where how came from
[06:34] <TwoD> aquagrunty: no
[06:34] <luislo> Hi all, please help. I have a problem with the avant-window-navigator... so it seems like it "thinks" the bar is below, so it appears at the bottom of the screen, but leaving an empty space below it... a ny ideas on how to fix this? I mean, it seems like I need to tell somehow gnome to move the taskbar somewhere else
[06:34] <joanki> i think that there is a serious bug
[06:34] <aquagrunty> TwoD: hm. the same thing happens to me, but only when i rotate the screen. its bad.
[06:34] <kwtm> What Ubuntu program do I use to create an archive of compressed files and move files/folders in and out of it?  (I cannot use Nautilus to do this; would like an alternative.)
[06:34] <Qb_Master> hey I have problems...think you guys can help
[06:34] <dxdt> How can I make it so that highlight copies everywhere and middle click is paste?
[06:34] <nickrud> chalcedony: private messages have their own files in ~/.xchat2/xchatlogs (assuming xchat, of course)
[06:34] <richard> Installed 7.10 tonight. .. impressed. . . I think I just may stick with gnome for a while. . . .
[06:34] <joanki> richard: try changin the theme color
[06:34] <troxor> luislo: you can just drag the panels around...
[06:35] <Qb_Master> I just installed Ubuntu Studio (with a lot of problems btw but I did get it)
[06:35] <jimmygoon> dxdt, well, with x there is the regular clipboard and then that is a secondary one already
[06:35] <aquagrunty> richard: gnome is pretty awesome. i'd normally opt for another smaller manager, but gnome in ubuntu is awesome.
[06:35] <richard> I have . ...and I like it even better. . . .
[06:35] <LiMaO> richard: you won't regret it =)
[06:35] <MaTrIx-X> jimmygoon: anything else you can think of? I'm just going to do away with this install otherwise
[06:35] <Qb_Master> and now I'm having problems installing NDISWrapper or a wireless driver
[06:35] <kwtm> LiMaO: Might be useful to post your script on the Ubuntu forums?
[06:35] <B_166-ER-X> well, it does happen, and i find that the only way to get rid of the 'frozen window' its to restart X .. not verty useful
[06:35] <joanki> what kind of video card do you have  twoD
[06:35] <joanki> mine is a nvidia also
[06:35] <richard> The graphics are very clean. . . .it is really nice. . . .
[06:35] <Qb_Master> I've been pulling out hair all night trying to get it to work, but I can't get anywhere despite all of the docs I've read
[06:35] <TwoD> joanki: nvidia
[06:35] <CorpseFeeder>  hi. How do I reset a user's password from root login?
[06:35] <LiMaO> kwtm: it's still there.
[06:35] <Qb_Master> and google isn't helping
[06:35] <kwtm> Qb_Master: Hey, what do you think of Ubuntu Studio so far? I'm thinking of setting it up.
[06:35] <joanki> i have been hearing other people say that over the past day
[06:35] <LiMaO> kwtm: er, i mean it's already there
[06:36] <Qb_Master> well the interface is nice but I've only had it running for about 5 hours
[06:36] <pupster> Question: In 7.04 when i plug in my keyboard/mouse i get a file "/etc/hiddev0" in 7.10 .. i do not, did this file move, or how do it get it back :P
[06:36] <luislo> let me try troxor, although it didn't seem to solve my problem. When I try to change the position from bottom to top, it says it's locked out... and AWN and many other applications still think the panel is there..
[06:36] <Qb_Master> and all that time I've been fighting wireless issues
[06:36] <luislo> :S
[06:36] <dxdt> CorpseFeeder: passwd username
[06:36] <kwtm> LiMaO: Good job.  I am still using a 32-bit system but may one day end up using your script. :)
[06:36] <Qb_Master> so I dunno
[06:36] <jimmygoon> MaTrIx-X, I can't think of anything, but there are more knowledgable people here. try googling the error msg and see if others hav e had the rpoblem
[06:36] <luislo> so they don't move below a certain threshold troxor
[06:36] <momdad> is there a way to uninstall xgl in term?
[06:36] <akincer> Grrr. Pidgin sometimes decides it doesn't want to follow the conversation down the page.
[06:36] <fabio> one more thing
[06:36] <fabio> to instal lamp in ununtu
[06:36] <jimmygoon> momdad, sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl
[06:36] <LiMaO> kwtm: i'll be around.. if you have any questions at any time, just tell me =) i'll be glad to try and help ya
[06:36] <dxdt> jimmygoon: explain more, what you said doesn't help me with my problem.  So there are two clipboards you say?
[06:36] <CorpseFeeder> dxdt: ok. thanks
[06:36] <kwtm> CorpseFeeder: If you have a root login, just use the "passwd" command at the command line.  When root runs it, it will ask you what the user's name is.  Oh, wait, no.
[06:36] <jimmygoon> momdad, or whatever that package name is... i think thats what it is
[06:37] <joanki> anyone know why my computer will not hibernate?
[06:37] <MaTrIx-X> jimmygoon: alright, thanks for trying then.. I already googled it and it didn't seem worthwhile.. I'll just save myself the time and do a new install
[06:37] <kwtm> CorpseFeeder: You need to type "passwd <username>".  That form of the command is only available to root.
[06:37] <thedukeny> How can I add A 23 inch 720P HDTV to my xorg.conf?
[06:37] <aquagrunty> joanki: ibm computer?
[06:37] <momdad> jimmygoon ty
[06:37] <fabio> becase you computer is a bear
[06:37] <kwtm> CorpseFeeder: If you're not root, you need to do "sudo passwd <username>"
[06:37] <CorpseFeeder> kwtm: yeah... I've already done it. ;)
[06:37] <troxor> luislo: so you want awn to sit on top of the bottom panel?
[06:37] <LiMaO> fabio: sem gracinhas =P
[06:37] <jimmygoon> dxdt, thats the way I read about it, but a bit of trying here in xchat seems to imply that they use the same clipboard area... fore xample ... just select some text right now and middle click in the input box... it gets copied alright
[06:37] <Qb_Master> loadndisdriver.c:15:20: error:stdlib.h No such file or directory
[06:37] <kwtm> LiMaO: So ... would you be able to help me with my question, above?
[06:37] <joanki> aquagrunty, no, dell
[06:37] <jimmygoon> momdad, sure
[06:37] <fabio> Limao lol
[06:37] <buntunub> has anyone gotten dual monitors working with the Screens and Graphics utility?
[06:37] <Qb_Master> ^^ that's the start of the errors I get when I try to install ndiswrapper
[06:37] <Cyber_Stalker> could some one help me quick: /home/cyber/MxitClient/nbproject/build-impl.xml:320: /home/cyber/MxitClient/dist/MxitClient.jar is read-only.
[06:38] <akincer> joanki: model number would be a good start
[06:38] <thedukeny> buntunub: no
[06:38] <joanki> xps m1210
[06:38] <CorpseFeeder> thanks, bye!
[06:38] <luislo> troxor: no, I want AWN to sit where it should..right at the bottom of the screen, but it doesn't because it thinks there's a panel there
[06:38] <Qb_Master> also get those when I try to install a linux wireless driver
[06:38] <robbizzle> ok so...how do I install ubuntu without a cd AND without a nework install...i realize I need a bootloader but how do I mount the ISO?
[06:38] <dxdt> buntunub: yes I did actually.  Then later I undid it because I needed to do some special things for AiGLX
[06:38] <luislo> and so does the other apps troxor
[06:38] <B_166-ER-X> -zyxnull- appear that i can remove the 'burned' window also by just stopping the compiz  effects, than start them back after
[06:38] <dxdt> buntunub: so I used the nvidia-settings program, but yeah at first it worked well for me
[06:38] <jimmygoon> Qb_Master, did you change the chmod file perms for all your home files?
[06:38] <thedukeny> dxdt: know how to add HDTV to xorg file?
[06:38] <troxor> luislo: strange.. one sec
[06:38] <Qb_Master> no, how do I do that?
[06:38] <jimmygoon> robbizzle, do you have an OS in place?
[06:38] <nickrud> !install | robbizzle there's a method listed here, I think
[06:38] <ubotu> robbizzle there's a method listed here, I think: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues - Don't want to use a CD? Try http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[06:38] <buntunub> well for me it does nothing but jack up my xorg badly
[06:38] <robbizzle> yes
[06:38] <jimmygoon> robbizzle, you can do usb install?
[06:38] <robbizzle> XP
[06:39] <kwtm> robbizzle: Interesting.  Where do you have Ubuntu if you don't have a CD or network?  Or you mean you can't boot from CD?
[06:39] <LiMaO> kwtm: have you tried using Ark?
[06:39] <Qb_Master> no, how do I do that?
[06:39] <buntunub> nvidia-settings seems to do OK, but Compiz causes random frequent lockups
[06:39] <akincer> janki: Google. It's your friend. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=xps+m1210+linux+hibernate&btnG=Google+Search
[06:39] <dxdt> thedukeny: nah, never tried.  More than likely if you are using nvidia plug the monitor in know its resolution and try to just run nvidia-settings and config it.
[06:39] <kwtm> LiMaO: Actually, funny you ask that --I came here because I was frustrated using Ark.  Two main problems:
[06:39] <jimmygoon> roobizzle google wubi
[06:39] <thedukeny> dxdt: im using ATI, and plug and play doesnt have a 720 resoultion offered
[06:39] <buntunub> any way to fix the random lockup issue with nvidia cards and compiz?
[06:39] <QMario> What do I do if my initrd file is deleted?
[06:40] <kwtm> LiMaO: Apparently it doesn't support adding to .tar.bz2 files (what the heck!?  I can only create an archive once and not add to it?)  And the second thing is
[06:40] <joanki> anyone know why my dell xps m1210 won't hibernate and how to fix it????
[06:40] <luislo> ok troxor, I'll wait, please don't forget to reply me
[06:40] <chalcedony> nickrud: i should have mentioned i'm in the xchatlogs directory .. i know how to  grep for postive things but i need to know how to grep to leave out the # sign
[06:40] <robbizzle> well
[06:40] <dxdt> buntunub: gotta be more specific.  I have no reandom lockups and I'm using Nvidia with Compiz+fusion
[06:40] <Ryuho> can someone tell me what is the best way to delete a partition of windows and leave just ubuntu? can ubuntu do that efficiently or do i have to find a boot disk with partitioner
[06:40] <Qb_Master> ugh
=== levander` is now known as levander
[06:40] <akincer> joanki: I gave you a link that has some information on it
[06:40] <robbizzle> my wireless won't work until I get into windows
[06:40] <joanki> you did?
[06:40] <robbizzle> and my NIC is busted
[06:40] <joanki> let me scroll up
[06:40] <nickrud> QMario: sudo update-initramfs -u
[06:40] <B_166-ER-X> Anybody knows an App that could read the feed of a Composite entry (in a tv-card) and record the feed ?
[06:40] <akincer> joanki: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=332100
[06:40] <buntunub> it randomly locks up for a few seconds of a time with compiz enabled
[06:40] <dxdt> Ryuho: ubuntu should be able to do it.  Try running cfdisk from the command line
[06:40] <akincer> There's a direct link
[06:40] <Qb_Master> loadndisdriver.c:15:20 error:stdlib.h No Such File or Directory
[06:40] <joanki> got it that time
[06:40] <kwtm> LiMaO: Ark says I've run out of disk space.  I don't know why; I have lots of disk space.  I suspect that it's using a temporary file that's on one of my drives that's almost full, but I don't know how to specify the temporary file.
[06:40] <dga> how can i disable gnome-screensaver?
[06:40] <Ryuho> thanks dxdt
[06:40] <elliott541a> anyone here experienced with samba?
[06:41] <nickrud> chalcedony: ah, I am not a grep master, sorry
[06:41] <LiMaO> kwtm: i never used it, but some people say xarchive is good
[06:41] <kwtm> LiMaO: There are no settings for specifying the temp file.  So now it's completely useless.
[06:41] <Qb_Master> loadndisdriver.c:15:20 error:stdlib.h No Such File or Directory -- and a lot of other errors upon install of NDISwrapper. What do I do?
[06:41] <elliott541a> i'm having trouble with user authentication
[06:41] <kwtm> LiMaO: Okay, will check out Xarchive.
[06:41] <LiMaO> archiver
[06:41] <Binger> can anyone help me make a new initrd.img with yaird?
[06:41] <levander> I just upgraded to Gutsy, sound card's not working.  But first, in this Restricted Drivers Manager thing, it says I have some "Lucent/Agere linmodem controller driver" enabled.  Is linmodem a modem?  I don't have any modems on this machine.
[06:41] <LiMaO> xarchive or xarchiver, something like that
[06:41] <akincer> elliott541a: I've done quite a bit with it. What did you want to know?
[06:41] <levander> Anybody know what that driver is for?
[06:41] <Les_Caesars> how do I change the colors on metacity?
[06:41] <Les_Caesars> for window decorations

[06:41] <chalcedony> nickrud: tht's ok .. i need one
[06:41] <crazydeb8r> can anyone give me a hand figuring out how to make a PC card work?
[06:41] <Dyus> what happend to libdvdcss, i cant find it in the repos for gutsy
[06:41]  * nickrud really misses rob2
[06:42] <B_166-ER-X> !tv
[06:42] <ubotu> http://www.linuxtv.org/ has extensive information about using TV cards under Linux. Available viewers for analog cards: Zapping, tvtime (GTK/GNOME), kdetv (KDE), xawtv, motv. For digital cards: Klear (KDE), dvb-utils. For both analog and digital cards, !MythTV is a powerful framework. Your card may work the !IVTV drivers. See also !TV-Out
[06:42] <buntunub> Dyus: use ubuntu restricted extras
[06:42] <Qb_Master> dxdt: I think I did. That is by doing the apt-cdrom add, right?
[06:42] <dga> !dvd
[06:42] <ubutom> levandrt, had that on my desktop too. though it has no modem... ;)
[06:42] <ubotu> For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at !Medibuntu or (for Feisty and earlier) http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs
[06:42] <levander> Dyus: I don't think that's supposed to be in the Canonical repositories for legal reasons.  Was it in the Feisty repositories?
[06:42] <nickrud> Dyus: won't find it in ubuntu, you'll have to get it from medibuntu
[06:42] <ubutom> sry, levander i meant ;( had that on my desktop too. though it has no modem... ;)
[06:42] <buntunub> incorrect its in the medibuntu repos
[06:42] <dxdt> Dyus: libdvdread3
[06:42] <troxor> luislo: what version are you using?
[06:43] <nickrud> dxdt: that gets 1.2.5, 1.2.9 is available widely
[06:43] <Dyus> ok my dumb mistake, i forgot it was in media, not the offical repos
[06:43] <dga> does anyone using compiz fusion have a working gnome-screensaver?
[06:43] <levander> ubutom: Did you just disable it?  I just searched the Ubuntu Forums, no one's said much about it.
[06:43] <Qb_Master> dxdt: I think I did. That is by doing the "apt-cdrom add", right?
[06:43] <luislo> AWn version? the dev version...
[06:43] <LiMaO> kwtm: xarchiver is the package.. just checked it out
[06:43] <buntunub> all thats in the ubuntu docs
[06:43] <levander> I just upgraded to Gutsy.  Am I now using Compiz?
[06:43] <ubutom> levander, in my cas it wasn't active, just shown as an option
[06:43] <BaD-CrC> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=584494  <-- any takers?
[06:43] <chronographer> Hello.  what python IDE is your favorite?
[06:43] <dxdt> chronographer: Vim or gvim
[06:43] <buntunub> nothing in the docs about how to stop random frequent lockups tho :(
[06:43] <luislo> troxor: I'm on suse10.3, but nobody there seems to use AWN
[06:44] <chronographer> no not vim.. too hard
[06:44] <luislo> troxor: however I used it in suse10.2 and worked perfectly
[06:44] <troxor> luislo: ok, one sec- I'm trying to replicate it
[06:44] <heartsblood> where is the setting for the defualt window manager saved?
[06:44] <kwtm> LiMaO: Yes, I just checked it in Adept.  Looks like "xarchive" is the shell script wrapper, and "xarchiver" is the one with built-in.  Will apt-get install it now.
[06:44] <Qb_Master> ???
[06:44] <chronographer> Im a modern man, not used to the old school text editors
[06:44] <djzhan> 大家好呀
[06:44] <ubutom> chronographer, use nano ;D
[06:44] <nickrud> heartsblood: ~/.gconf/apps/metacity (access it with gconf-editor, navigate to apps/metacity)
[06:44] <buntunub> lol oh no not that big bad console!
[06:45] <LIN-LYN> 好
[06:45] <elliott541a> akincer: check the PM I sent you
[06:45] <Madpilot> chronographer, search synaptic for 'python ide' there are several - plus lots of text editors, of course
[06:45] <nickrud> !cn | LIN-LYN
[06:45] <ubotu> LIN-LYN: For Ubuntu help in Chinese 您可以访问中文频道： #ubuntu-cn 或者 #ubuntu-tw  或者 #ubuntu-hk
[06:45] <chronographer> yeh I know..  just wanted an opinion. I gues sill go with stani's
[06:45] <levander> Why does every newbie refer to "we" when talking about what should or should not be in Ubuntu?
[06:45] <dxdt> nano sucks don't use nano.  It is a text editor designed after a mail client
[06:45] <levander> Every newbie on ubuntuforums.org
[06:45] <nickrud> we don't know
[06:46] <akincer> elliott: I did and have typed back a few messages
[06:46] <jmagder> I just instaleld 7.10 with encryption,and it freezes after "Setting up cryptographic volume"
[06:46] <jmagder> Any suggestions on fixing this? :)
[06:46] <heartsblood> nickrud: maybe I wasn't clear enough.  Where are is the setting that determines what window manager is used?
[06:46] <buntunub> dxdt: whatever gave you that idea lol
[06:46] <levander> nickrud: It's like they think they are part of a group that owns Ubuntu.  It's weird.
[06:46] <wallace> when did ubotu learn chinese?
[06:46] <elliott541a> jmagder: Kick it a few times
[06:46] <buntunub> nano is awesome and works as well or better than vim
[06:46] <LIN-LYN> o i know
[06:46] <nickrud> heartsblood: ah, that's shifted around and I've lost track ;(
[06:46] <TwoD> joanki, I think I'm on to something: type gnome-appearance-properties in the terminal and see if you get any errors
[06:46] <hydrogen> heartsblood: do you mean like gnome vs. kde or which window manager is used within gnome or kde?
[06:46] <jmagder> elliott541a: lol.  I'd rather not. :-)
[06:46] <linoleum> Hi , guys, I have reinstalled ubuntu , from feisty to gusty, but now, I can't find any package, from canoncal parter, to medibutunu, who can make me install Realplayer
[06:47] <joanki> ok
[06:47] <heartsblood> hydrogen: within, ie metacity/compiz/etc.
[06:47] <jmagder> elliott541a: I had encrypted set up on 7.04, but I thought I'd do a reinstall.
[06:47] <chronographer> yeah I use nano if im stuck at command line
[06:47] <joanki> no errors
[06:47] <dxdt> buntunub: actually, it never dawned on me until a friend pointed it out and then I was like MY GOD YOU"RE RIGHT!
[06:47] <joanki> it opens appearance preferences
[06:47] <buntunub> linoleum just download the tar and compile it
[06:47] <dystopianray> nano is rubbish compared to vim
[06:47] <dxdt> I use vim anyway, so it doesn't matter, but it was still like WHOA
[06:47] <troxor> luislo: oh, btw.. did you ever try to build the latest from source?
[06:47] <joanki> TwoD no errors
[06:47] <levander> linoleum: The upgrade process sets your sources.list back to a very thin default for the new release.  YOu have to re-add the repositories you installed those packages from to sources.list.
[06:47] <TwoD> I get "kde-config: not found"- duh, I'm running Gnome... but then I also get "X Error: BadDevice, incalid or unitialized input device 171"
[06:48] <elliott541a> jmagder unfortunately I know nothing about encryption
[06:48] <hydrogen> heartsblood: thats usually not a uuser visible setting.. I know that kde looks for the KDEWM env variable setting.. and I'd imagine that gnome does something about as predictable
[06:48] <buntunub> well for me nano is VERY user friendly and does the job 10 times out of 10
[06:48] <hydrogen> !baddevice | TwoD
[06:48] <ubotu> TwoD: If you are receiving an error similar to "X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168", it can be safely ignored. If you want to get rid of the error messages then please visit this page: http://seerofsouls.com/wiki/How-Tos/BadDeviceErrors
[06:48] <luislo> troxor: yes, I actually build it from source
[06:48] <joanki> weird
[06:48] <hydrogen> nano isn't bad
[06:48] <nugod> i've found nano to be great when you just want to get in, make a quick change and get out
[06:48] <akincer> elliott541a: I sent you back a few messages. I'm getting tired, so my shelf life is pretty short. If you want Samba help, now's the time
[06:48] <heartsblood> hydrogen: that does answer my root question.  ty.
[06:48] <hydrogen> its just a whole bunch slower than vim once you get used to vim
[06:48] <dxdt> WAY slower
[06:48] <nickrud> nono is good for quickies, vim for a little more, emacs for things longer than 5 screens for me
[06:49] <jmagder> elliott541a: thanks anyways. :)  I just booted up into the installer again, and it looks like some how the partition was destroyed. Tht would be a problem.  I'll try again.  :)
[06:49] <dxdt> swapping two lines in vim is 3 keystrokes
[06:49] <dystopianray> vim > emacs
[06:49] <dxdt> ddp
[06:49] <elliott541a> akincer: I'm not getting them
[06:49] <hydrogen> and it doesn't work well after you use vim because you end up with random letters all over your screen :)
[06:49] <buntunub> thats the key there.. vim takes alot of getting used to unlike nano
[06:49] <nickrud> !editorwar
[06:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about editorwar - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[06:49] <dxdt> nickrud: huzzah!  Nice try!
[06:49] <nickrud> I still think they should put that one back
[06:49] <hydrogen> buntunub: right.
[06:49] <simplyubuntu> nickrud!
[06:49] <akincer> Comparing vi and nano is like comparing a spoon and a spork.
[06:49] <hydrogen> buntunub: well.. runnig vimtutor is enough to get used to it mostly
[06:49] <nickrud> dxdt: it used to have a really sarcastic blurb
[06:49] <simplyubuntu> it still wants to download!!!
[06:50] <riotkittie> [insert-noun-here]wars are silly.
[06:50] <hydrogen> hmm
[06:50] <hydrogen> how about we take out the part between [ and ]
[06:50] <hydrogen> and just leave it with wars are silly.
[06:50] <LiMaO> riotkittie: the noun insertion itself is optional. wars are silly.
[06:50] <hydrogen> because flamewars are silly
[06:50] <kwtm> Man, this .tar.bz2 file sure takes long to read!  I just want to see what's in the archive, for crying out loud!  I wonder if .bz2.tar would work better.
[06:50] <hydrogen> err
[06:50] <ubutom> nickrud: editorwar, the war between editors waged on several centuries, until **** won :-)
[06:50] <hydrogen> thats a noun though
[06:50] <heartsblood> hydrogen: If a user can't manipulate the defualt window manager, what setting(s) are available to them?  if I wanted to run compiz on 1 user and meta on another (without using gconf-editor) how would I do it?
[06:50] <hydrogen> couldbewars are silly!
[06:51] <ubutom> sorry, im a bad impostor, hehe :)
[06:51] <nickrud> ubutom: heh
[06:51] <dxdt> see I disagree.  Not only do I think flamewars are productive, I think they let people vent frustrations that otherwise may be built up and released in more harmful ways.  Flamewars on the internet rock
[06:51] <riotkittie> LiMaO: not necessarily. but that's OT, so i'll shut up :P
[06:51] <nickrud> ubutom: not real bad, either ;)
[06:51] <hydrogen> heartsblood: I'd guess you would run compiz --replace & in an autostart file for one user
[06:51] <LiMaO> riotkittie: OT?
[06:51] <LiMaO> didn't get it, sorry =/
[06:51] <riotkittie> Off Topic
[06:51] <LiMaO> oh ok
[06:51] <Ryuho> can Tremulous be run with 1.1GH Pentium M, 1GB ram, integrated graphics card?
[06:51] <buntunub> flaming can be productive whenever its directed at SCO or M$ cronies
[06:51] <cwwang> Anyone here has problem getting Linksys 54G working with 7.1?
[06:51] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: you'll have to remove a lot of stuff to avoid downloading stuff
[06:51] <heartsblood> hydrogen: but that wont save.  how do I make that a defualt for the session?
[06:52] <akincer> elliott: have you read any of the Samba docs at samba.org?
[06:52] <ubutom> think so, Ryuho
[06:52] <asc> Ryuho: Depends on the card, but probably.
[06:52] <hydrogen> heartsblood: if its in an autostart file it will run every time you log in
[06:52] <Ryuho> k .. lol on top of that, it's a tablet
[06:52] <hydrogen> !autostart
[06:52] <ubotu> To add programs to start up when you log into your Gnome session go to System>Preferences>Sessions and use the Startup Programs tab. For more information, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingProgramToSessionStartup - See !boot for starting non-interactive programs at boot
[06:52] <dxdt> flaming gets ideas out there.  New ways of thinking, etc.  that is actually where I learned to swap two lines quickly in in vim with ddp.  A flamewar.
[06:52] <luislo> troxor: yes, I actually build it from source
[06:52] <Ryuho> i wonder if it will work
[06:52] <simplyubuntu> but i remover the WHOLE of kde and xubuntu
[06:52] <troxor> luislo: 0.2?
[06:52] <heartsblood> hydrogen: ah
[06:52] <simplyubuntu> this sucks butt man
[06:52] <LiMaO> i had some zsnes package for 64bit.. but i think i lost it.. does anyone know of it?
[06:53] <elliott541a> akincer: no, but i've been looking at other examples that I know I've used with success in the past
[06:53] <simplyubuntu> at least 4 hours for 415 mb
[06:53] <asc> Ryuho: It's based on the Q3 engine, which works with quite old hardware, but probably the only way to know for certain is to try it
[06:53] <simplyubuntu> grrr
[06:53] <nickrud> dxdt: flamewars sap good will, and I don't see that ever being a good thing
[06:53] <luislo> troxor: you mean the awn, I build the dev version, so the most recent one yes
[06:53] <Ryuho> ya, i think i will
[06:53] <critt> Upgraded to 7.10 today Now I have no window decorations. Tried everything I could find nothing working . Any Help on this problem yet?
[06:53] <simplyubuntu> so youre saying this is natural, and there's nothing i can do to avoid it?
[06:53] <riotkittie> critt: did you enable window decoration plugin in compizconfig-settings-manager?
[06:53] <troxor> luislo: it's not building for me without a fight, still working at it
[06:54] <akincer> elliott: Things change from version to version. Plus, is this a simple environment or are you running an auth server like LDAP or Active Directory?
[06:54] <buntunub> get emerald and just do emerald --replace
[06:54] <critt> riotkittie yes I did
[06:54] <luislo> troxor: :O you already build it? coz you have to install before many dependencies... which website are you following?
[06:54] <ToddEDM> hey guys, how do i install Flash?
[06:54] <buntunub> or dont and do metacity --replace
[06:54] <h1st0> !flash > ToddEDM
[06:54] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: yes
[06:54] <Ryuho> how big do you guys make your swap partition? should i even make one?
[06:54] <simplyubuntu> darn it.
[06:54] <nickrud> ToddEDM: sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[06:55] <asc> critt: Ask in #ubuntu-effects; there are fixes. One thing you can try is running gtk-window-decorator --replace, but there's at least one Uberwizard in effects who fixed that for me.
[06:55] <w4ett> ToddEDM: from Synaptic
[06:55] <h1st0> Ryuho: 1.5 times amount of ram is usually a good rule.
[06:55] <dxdt> Ryuho: personally 2x ram up to 1 GB for me.  I can't imagine swapping more than 1GB but if you are doing movies or something you may want to do more than that.  I personally don't
[06:55] <buntunub> ryohu you dont necessarily need a swap, but its highly advisable
[06:55] <simplyubuntu> if my power goes out while dowloading pkgs it shouldnt be an issue right?
[06:55] <h1st0> Ryuho: er 2.56
[06:55] <asc> ryohu: How much RAM do you have?
[06:55] <h1st0> Ryuho: jesus I can't type tonight.
[06:55] <dxdt> Ryuho: you want swap unless you can answer the question "Do I need swap?" without asking.
[06:55] <Ryuho> lol ya
[06:55] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: no, it will resume downloading where it left off.
[06:55] <elliott541a> akincer: There's nothing special about it. the computer is running dapper if that means anything
[06:55] <troxor> luislo: no site, just my intuition, which at this hour probably isn't reliable :)
[06:55] <critt> One little trick did work but no more. Ran in term and as long as term was open my window decorations were there ."gnome-compiz-preferences"
[06:55] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: no different that ctl-c in apt-get upgrade (during download phase)
[06:55] <simplyubuntu> good
[06:56] <simplyubuntu> hold on
[06:56] <h1st0> asc: #ubuntu-effects is gone.
[06:56] <Ryuho> umm thanks h1st0 and dxdt i have 1GB of ram, so I guess i'll make mine 2GB
[06:56] <levander> Anybody know what I should start reading to figure out why my soundcard doesn't work after upgrading to Gutsy?
[06:56] <phrost> any idea what would cause a system to hang at Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local) ?
[06:56] <asc> It was there an hour ago :p
[06:56] <Ryuho> well.. that's a lot
[06:56] <Ryuho> maybe just a gig
[06:56] <akincer> elliott: I think Dapper runs Samba 3.0.22 unless you have compiled your own
[06:56] <h1st0> !swap > Ryuho
[06:56] <navaburo> The_Entropy, nice, care to share it (i am lazy and could make use of it)?
[06:56] <simplyubuntu> now it seems to be fetching pkgs pretty quickly... hmm possible from cd?
[06:56] <dxdt> Ryuho: I have one GB and I don't think I've ever swapped more than like 300mb so yeah 2GB should be more than enough.  1 GB is probably OK for you.
[06:56] <buntunub> ya your xorg is hosed lol
[06:56] <critt> asc Ty will try
[06:56] <elliott541a> levander: Are you using the amd64 version?
[06:56] <w4ett> asc:  	 irc://freenode/compiz-fusion
[06:57] <asc> I see 200 people in #ubuntu-effects.
[06:57] <dxdt> ubuntu effects just redirects you
[06:57] <Ryuho> hmm considering i've never seen my RAM being used more than 30%
[06:57] <dxdt> it is still there, just new name
[06:57] <akincer> elliott: Is this a Linux to Linux file share?
[06:57] <riotkittie> doesn ubuntu-effects redirect to #compiz
[06:57] <elliott541a> akincer: nope, I just used apt-get. Should I look for instructions specific to that version?
[06:57] <h1st0> Ryuho: as long as you have slightly more swap then ram you should be fine.  I used the installer and 1gig of ram it made 1gig of swap.
[06:57] <asc> Oh, #u-e redirects to #compiz-fusion
[06:57] <h1st0> dxdt: no its gone
[06:57] <akincer> elliott: Just trust your man pages that come with it
[06:57] <h1st0> dxdt: support is in here.
[06:57] <Ryuho> asc why is that?
[06:57] <elliott541a> akincer: there will be both linux and windows users using it
[06:58] <h1st0> akincer: They got rid fo that channel since compiz-fusion is on by default now.
[06:58] <dxdt> h1st0: then why the redirect?  They would just send you to nowhere if it was really gone.
[06:58] <asc> Ryuho: Probably because they did the same thing, I guess. But I think you meant to ask h1st0
[06:58] <yigal> has anyone successfully built opensync 0.22 and onward?
[06:58] <[chr0n0s]> !nvy
[06:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvy - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[06:58] <[chr0n0s]> !envy
[06:58] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[06:58] <FunnyLookinHat> What the frick.  Azureus crashes whenever I open it on gutsy
[06:58] <h1st0> dxdt: read the line above yourse
[06:58] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone else had this issue?
[06:58] <dxdt> I did, and that is why I consider them to be the same thing still.
[06:58] <Pe3k> hello, I have tv tuner with chip conexant (pci card) lspci|grep Conexant -> http://pastebin.com/m781373c1 and there isn't device /dev/videoX for it (only video0 - my usb webcam) how can I do it?
[06:58] <buntunub> havent tried azureus yet
[06:58] <dxdt> FunnyLookinHat: maybe that you aren't using Sun's java
[06:59] <Ryuho> FunnyLookinHat maybe you want to look at other torrent
[06:59] <Ryuho> programs
[06:59] <LastLemming> hi
[06:59] <h1st0> dxdt: They got rid of it since compiz-fusion is enabled by default now.  THere is no need to have another room for it.  The old #desktop-effects is gone and support for it is now here.
[06:59] <SeNsEi_SaMe> ahi ppl
[06:59] <simplyubuntu> or maybe they're just REALLY small package files
[06:59] <kwtm> LiMaO: Tried Xarchiver.  Unfortunately, it is not drag&drop.  Will continue to try to use Ark and figure out how to specify the temporary file.  Thanks, though.
[06:59] <SeNsEi_SaMe> hi*
[06:59] <riotkittie> will resizing my partitions result in the UUIDs changing and totally screw up fstab? :D
[06:59] <dxdt> h1st0: then compiz-fusion  is support for? Not compiz fusion or dev only?
[06:59] <asc> Ryuho: Also, I can't speak for anyone else but I usually recommend small amounts of swap. If you're swapping more than 256ish under a desktop workload, the system will be nearly unresponsive anyway. :p
[06:59] <Ryuho> h1st0 thx for the explanation, i upgraded to gutsy, maybe ill look into new feature
[06:59] <dxdt> and I realize It is in by default since I'm using it on dual monitors right now
[06:59] <yigal> has anyone successfully built opensync 0.22 and onward?
[07:00] <LiMaO> kwtm: you're welcome. sorry if i don't know of any other better app that would suit to your needs.
[07:00] <akincer> elliott: There shouldn't be too much special about it. You will have to set your workgroup setting to be the same as your Windows clients (e.g. MSHOME)
[07:00] <h1st0> dxdt: that channel is only for compiz specific help.  If you /topic you can see.
[07:00] <riotkittie> if your workgroup is named MSHOME, you should be ashamed. :x
[07:00] <LastLemming> I need about my laptop tobshiba P100, I remake the DSDT.aml like for feisty to fix sound and acpi for my GPU fan
[07:00] <h1st0> Ryuho: new feature?
[07:00] <LastLemming> but it doesn't work
[07:01] <Ryuho> new gui features (eye candy)
[07:01] <h1st0> riotkittie: Why's that?  I love the windows users with limewire that share their My Documents unknowingly.  You'd be suprised what you could find.
[07:01] <LastLemming> I need help about gusty and my laptop tobshiba P100, I remake the DSDT.aml like for feisty to fix sound and acpi for my GPU fan, but it doesn't work
[07:01] <dxdt> h1st0: Yeah I see the topic.  Thanks.  Call a spade a spade.  That is still where a lot of people for help with compiz stuffs.

[07:02] <kwtm> LiMaO: Not your fault.  Just wish the KDE people would have made decent documentation for their programs.  Not like "Manual, Chapter 3: the 'Wigglywoo' menu option.  This option allows you to use the 'Wigglywoo' command."  Like, no, DUHHHhhhh!!!  I really needed a manual to tell me that!

[07:03] <luislo> troxor? any success?
[07:03] <dxdt> cgkm: ?  what cpu???
[07:04] <h1st0> cgkm: what kind of cpu do you have and what version of ubuntu do you have?

[07:05] <jared> People who upgraded from feisty to gusty....when you upgrade, what do you type to get compiz running and make it default?
[07:05] <h1st0> LastLemming: did you dist-upgrade?
[07:05] <pupster> Hey guys, what is a good command for just returning the top (or second or third) cpu process (the process taking the most cpu)
[07:05] <h1st0> jared: its already default
[07:05] <SteamMachine> sudo gpg --delete-secret-keys Sally Struthers says the key can't be found. IS this because of the space inbetween? If so, can it be removed anyway?
[07:05] <jared> even if you dist-upgraded?

[07:07] <Fyda> I'm dist-upgrading my other machine to Gutsy right now, and the WM (Compiz compiled from git) crashed. Then the installation got stuck at tzdata, so I had to kill the configuration process for that, which let the upgrade continue.
[07:07] <Fyda> It spat out a lot of errors about unconfigured packages though.
=== jared is now known as KI4IKL
[07:08] <Fyda> I'm concerned that this might lead to an unbootable system. Any recommended course of action?

[07:30] <Jban> marx2k: Well, I dont want to answer your question because I was just going off of what zparta was saying, which may not be what I am looking for since he doesnt know how to do it for ubuntu
[07:30] <LastLemming> I aggred with him
[07:30] <dizy> hi guys... i just installed 7.1 server edition... it found my rtl8169 gigabit ethernet card ... but its only running at 100 ... i have a gigabit switch and it shows my other computers at 1000 and the ubuntu at 100 ...  im hoping someone can at least point me in the right direction about how to go about setting it up to work at 1000
[07:30] <sojourney> hi
[07:30] <marx2k> ok
[07:30] <zparta> troxor: yeah
[07:30] <james296> Im talking about help.ubuntu.com
[07:30] <troxor> zparta: yeah, that sounds like `root-tail`
[07:30] <zparta> troxor: i had it as a default size of my console window in the upper left corner
[07:30] <james296> it only shows tabs for 6.06LTS 6.10 and 7.04
[07:30] <james296> but I dont see any 7.10
[07:30] <LastLemming> james296, someone from ubuntu.com help you?
[07:30] <troxor> zparta: or conky
[07:31] <dxdt> Oh.  I've never been there before.  I dunno.
[07:31] <zparta> i used to do that to several other apps aswell
[07:31] <tenemag> anyone here know how I can get things like compiz working on this laptop that only has a ATI Xpress 200 card built in?
[07:31] <tenemag> also if there's a quick/easy way to configure conky
[07:31] <crdlb> tenemag, enable the restricted driver and install xserver-xgl
[07:31] <mtholdenss> cube aint working in compiz fusion, all im getting is two desktops, just 2 fliping, ive got 4 desktops enabled and can't go to desktop 3 and 4 no more
[07:31] <james296> ok, so no one knows why theres nothing about version 7.10 in help.ubuntu.com?
[07:31] <marx2k> you can only config conky through editing the conky config
[07:32] <crdlb> mtholdenss, change the "horizontal virtual size"
[07:32] <Jban> How do I configure my Device Out (for all sound) in Ubuntu7.10? I am using a Dell XPS Gen2 laptop, and I have a USB Headset, which is recognised.... in Sound options, It is selected, but when I play a DVD or a Youtube video, the sound comes out through the default laptop speakers.... but in programs where I can select it, like Skype or Pidgin, it comes out through my USB headset.
[07:32] <luislo> troxor: yeah, your suggestion actually proves that AWN is not "thinking" there is a panel there... because now I added more and the AWN is still off by just 1 cm as previously...
[07:32] <dxdt> james296: they probably just haven't got around to it yet.
[07:32] <sojourney> so, i try install the icewm in the ubuntu but i dont got...can how do?
[07:32] <tenemag> crdlb: well I enabled the restricted driver, so just install xserver-xgl and it should work?
[07:32] <jared> http://pastebin.com/m6de5734d Why do I get this error when I start compiz...compiz still works but what is this doing?
[07:32] <marx2k> JBan: possibly go to console and type "sudo alsaconfig"
[07:32] <marx2k> or alsaconf
[07:32] <marx2k> I forget what its called
[07:32] <dxdt> xserver-xgl should only be installed if AiGLX doesn't work.
[07:32] <luislo> troxor: but why can't I put anything below a threshold at the bottom of my screen? (about 1cm above the bottom)
[07:32] <crdlb> tenemag, you'll need to log out and back in though
[07:32] <cLINTo> installed gusty, stupid question, why is there a little green man where my shutdown button is on the upper panel? lol
[07:32] <luislo> troxor: but why can't I put anything below a threshold at the bottom of my screen? (about 1cm above the bottom)
[07:32] <dxdt> cause it is an admittedly ugly hack by the devs and aiglx is better
[07:33] <crdlb> dxdt, Xgl can be a lot faster
[07:33] <tenemag> so just log out, then log back in and compiz should work...
[07:33] <crdlb> for nvidia
[07:33] <crdlb> tenemag, yes
[07:33] <tenemag> aight brb
[07:33] <Jban> Those dont work
[07:33] <sojourney> i received any errors....
[07:33] <troxor> luislo: good question, I don't think gnome has any "desktop margins" like xfce does, but I could be wrong-
[07:33] <dxdt> it is recommended by the powers at be to avoid it if possible.  The Berly wiki actually used to call it "last resort"  but Ok  I'll take your word for it on the "faster" thing.  Which I don't think it is honestly
[07:34] <Cyber_Stalker> after the reboot i am now getting "The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured." any suggestions
[07:34] <crdlb> dxdt, beryl is not compiz, beryl worked terrible with Xgl, compiz doesn't
[07:34] <CoasterMaster> How can I set a hotkey (such as <Super>+L) to lock the screen (7.10)?
[07:34] <luislo> troxor: and as a matter of fact, this only happens in GNOME, I logged into KDE and works fine in there
[07:34] <crdlb> dxdt, and Xglx is a hack, but so is everything else to some degree
[07:34] <dxdt> crdlb: no, it isn't, but berly has now remerged into compiz-fusion stuffs.  The devs are working together now
[07:34] <fatcatmatt> gosh dang it, i love 7.10!
[07:34] <crdlb> dxdt, but the core is 100% compiz
[07:34] <troxor> luislo: what if you used a randr applet to do a live resize of your resolution, then back again?
[07:35] <[chr0n0s]> i hate 7.10 :S
[07:35] <fatcatmatt> why [chr0n0s]?
[07:35] <Apachez> when you are using alternate cd 7.10 to install an encrypted disk, how can I after installation verify that both / and swap are encrypted ?
[07:35] <luislo> troxor: what do u mean a randr applet?
[07:35] <derrrface> "Desktop effects could not be enabled"... using a Radeon 7500 vid card 64MB....
[07:35] <Apachez> also how can I see which encryption algo the alternate cd uses by default ?
[07:35] <brad016> Hey, whenever I boot into ubuntu 7.10 the loading screen doesn't appear, it's all just blank
[07:35] <[chr0n0s]> fatcatmatt, nothing working on ATi
[07:35] <troxor> luislo: you also said that other windows think there's a panel there, so do they snap to that 1cm area that you mentioned, like there was another object there?
[07:35] <troxor> luislo: like krandrtray
[07:35] <fatcatmatt> [chr0n0s]: ouch...that's why nvidia gets the win!
[07:35] <Les_Caesars> does anyone know how you change the colors of window decorations?
[07:35] <crdlb> derrrface, I told you what the problem is, I just don't know why the solution didn't work :/
[07:36] <luislo> ok I see, yeah, that also happens
[07:36] <nikolai> im having a problem with compiz, it wont make a cube but a when i spin the desktop it shows a flat surface. i enabled cube effects and spinning, but not a cube just flat
[07:36] <luislo> the only think I can put below that threshold line is a panel...
[07:36] <[chr0n0s]> fatcatmatt,  :-|
[07:36] <crdlb> nikolai, general options>desktop size>horizontal virtual size>4
[07:36] <vega-> anyone done an upgrade from feisty to gutsy and has root on software raid? if so, did it go ok? :)
[07:36] <tenemag> aight i'm back...
[07:36] <luislo> troxor: ok I see, yeah, that also happens, the only think I can put below that threshold line is a panel...
[07:36] <brad016> I have a problem with booting up, the ubuntu sign and loading bar nevers shows up
[07:37] <fatcatmatt> [chr0n0s]: I have an HP Pavillion DV9230US Laptop, but I sympathize with ya...in a way...
[07:37] <tenemag> I installed that, logged out and back in again and now I can start compiz... *however*...  I am running into a slight issue when it comes to configuring it
[07:37] <troxor> luislo: does this happen for other users, say, like a dummy account, with default settings?
[07:37] <tenemag> is there a menu or something where I can configure it?
[07:37] <[chr0n0s]> fatcatmatt, 7.04 working even with comiz
[07:37] <crdlb> !ccsm | tenemag
[07:37] <ubotu> tenemag: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[07:37] <tenemag> ah, aight
[07:37] <fatcatmatt> [chr0n0s]: I have compiz going with Emerald :)  imma happy camper
[07:38] <tenemag> lol is emerald easy to install too?
[07:38] <Jban> With smoores?
[07:38] <Jban> and a camp fire?
[07:38] <DShepherd> tenemag, apt-get? :-)
[07:38] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: yes.  synaptics package manager > search for emerald
[07:38] <marx2k> I thought Gutsy was supposed to have spinning cube and all that by default?
[07:38] <derrrface> is there a way to have ubuntu automatically mount a hd w/o me having to enter a password everytime I boot into linux.......
[07:38] <crdlb> marx2k, gutsy uses wall by default
[07:38] <marx2k> is there a way to change trhat?
[07:38] <CoasterMaster> marx2k, Gutsy has all that, but you need the fancier customization enabled
[07:38] <dystopianray> derrrface: put it in fstab
[07:38] <crdlb> marx2k, yes, using ccsm
[07:38] <m0u5e> so i have ubuntu gutsy installed,, but how do i get it working using easyBCD loader?
[07:39] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: then on the net... http://themes.beryl-project.org/
[07:39] <CoasterMaster> marx2k, System -> Preferences -> Appearance.  Go to the Visual Effects tab and choose Extra
[07:39] <marx2k> I dont see why that isnt just installed automatically
[07:39] <marx2k> Coaster: That doesnt choose cube... just gives wobbly windows
[07:39] <LiMaO> i wonder why the hell freenode keeps executing 'proxy checks' on my ip
[07:39] <derrrface> dystopinray: not quite sure... i typed that @ terminal. did not give me any info
[07:39] <tenemag> y
[07:39] <CoasterMaster> marx2k, oh sorry, I thought it did
[07:39] <tenemag> whoops
[07:39] <tenemag> lol
[07:39] <m0u5e> anyone know how to use EASYBCD for vista?
[07:39] <luislo> troxor: it happens for root as well
[07:39] <tenemag> meant to answer "y" to apt
[07:39] <tenemag> lol
[07:40] <crdlb> marx2k, beause it takes up a lot of space and makes it extremely easy for a new users to completely break their compiz
[07:40] <dystopianray> derrrface: you need to edit /etc/fstab and add entries for the partitions you want mounted
[07:40] <marx2k> crdlb: Do you know if compiz-fusion-icon or whatever it was called is still useable with this?
[07:40] <nikolai> i changed the horixontal and vertical to 4 and still nothing. wont show a cube
[07:40] <fatcatmatt> m0u5e: search google for EASYBCD Vista
[07:40] <m0u5e> marx2k: fusion-icon is still usable w/ the compiz-fusion
[07:40] <crdlb> marx2k, you don't really need it but it would work
[07:41] <derrrface> editdystopianray: can u give me a quick easy way to edit ( i just tried to "edit /etc/fstab ) w/ a error.
[07:41] <marx2k> I like the icon's functionality in that it allows to switch back and forth between window managers and decorators
[07:41] <dystopianray> derrrface: no
[07:41] <kelmelzer> anyone know if the XGI Volari support is fixed in 7.10?
[07:41] <m0u5e> anyone know whats up with easyBCD?
[07:41] <Jban> May I borrow someone for my USB sound thing for a few minutes? I apologize for asking every 20 minutes or so, but I just want to nail this last issue down and head off to bed.
[07:41] <petru> hello! how can i install xanim using the terminal?
[07:41] <marx2k> derrrface, 'gksudo gedit /etc/fstab'
[07:41] <m0u5e> i want to get my gutsy working... and the only thing stopping me is how to get easyBCD configured to boot gutsy
[07:41] <fatcatmatt> petru: google it
[07:41] <[chr0n0s]> petru, use sudo apt-get install xanim
[07:42] <DShepherd> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41478/ -- kool!
[07:42] <Cyber_Stalker> can any one please help me fix "The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured."
[07:42] <LiMaO> petru: sudo apt-get install xanim
[07:42] <troxor> luislo: if it happens to a brand new account by default, it's probably the code itself- what kind of resolution are you running?
[07:42] <petru> limao , is not working that way!
[07:42] <LiMaO> petru: what's happening?
[07:42] <luislo> troxor: 1280x800
[07:43] <marx2k> haha damn NetBeans still has the same issues as before...doesnt work unless you turn off composting effects
[07:43] <kelmelzer> is the XOrg support for XGI video cards fixed in 7.10?
[07:43] <petru> limao, error message, can not find the file...
[07:44] <dorian_> hey guys how do i install shockwave?
[07:44] <LiMaO> petru: what version of ubuntu are you using?
[07:44] <siropel> hello, for some reason ubuntu stoped mounting my ntfs partitions ... any idea? ...yes, they are in the fstab ...anyway to reload fstab?
[07:44] <slaytanic> Ubuntu hangs when suspending/hibernating, what should I be looking at to figure out why?
[07:44] <troxor> luislo: hmm, same here... I dunno- if you're on the bazaar version, compiled from src.. dunno what else could be the problem.. there has to be something dictating the desktop margin.. maybe `ps faux` will give you hints.. you can just start killing stuff (try nautilus/your-window-manager) at will, and see what happens :)
[07:44] <dystopianray> dorian_: there is no shockwave for linux
[07:44] <fatcatmatt> dorian_: may have to use wine
[07:44] <vega-> there is no xanim package in any ubuntu version according to packages.ubuntu.com
[07:44] <CoasterMaster> dorian_, unfortunately, shockwave isn't available for linux
[07:44] <dorian_> ah dan lol
[07:44] <dorian_> damn*
[07:44] <dorian_> thanks.
[07:44] <luislo> troxor: what's pf faux?
[07:44] <foo> Hm, this is strange, my nfs mount freezes after a certain amount of time. I can mount it, but when I ls it... it just hangs. Strange, any ideas? I've tried to restart nfs-kernel-server. If I restart my computer, it'll work fine. It's been working fine for years.
[07:44] <zparta> is there anyway i can have the expo plugin put the different sides of the cube in 2x2 in stea of 1x4 ?
[07:45] <thedefender> hey anyone know any good widget like things for ubuntu?
[07:45] <thedefender> !widgets

[07:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about widgets - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[07:45] <tvst> hi all. is anyone having trouble compiling from git on ubuntu gutsy? of,  even bettery, is there a repo with the latest compiz?

[07:48] <tenemag> how do I add compiz to startup with ubuntu?
[07:48] <tenemag> (so i dont have to manually start it)
[07:48] <Jymmm> I'm trying to add a second static ip on ubuntu server, but when I restart the netwrok it complains about duplicate option, any ideas?
[07:48] <tvst> one way to do it is to add it to your session

[07:49] <DShepherd> tenemag, huh?
[07:49] <DShepherd> tenemag, it automatically starts.. well my does with gutsy?
[07:49] <nikolai> How can I get compiz to show the cube instead of a flat surface when i flip the windows, also I only see 2 windows it wont show 4
[07:49] <vega-> Jymmm: to the same network card as the other ip? if so, you have to define it as an alias, like eth0:1 style
[07:49] <simplechat> hey
[07:49] <troxor> tenemag: check out sessions in preferences

[07:55] <simplechat> DShepherd: what would fix it? reformastting it to ext3?
[07:56] <nikolai> still no 4 cubes my friend
[07:56] <nikolai> i dont know why
[07:56] <Lunz> is it possible to recover data from formatted usb drive?someone?
[07:56] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: why dont u just download a new cd of it?
[07:56] <nikolai> just a 2d flat surface it zooms in and out
[07:56] <tenemag> <-- out of CD's lol
[07:56] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: add more desktops
[07:56] <dystopianray> tenemag: sudo apt-get install subversion
[07:56] <Geoffrey2> when booting from the live CD, does anyone know what the hpet=disable command does when entered as a boot option?
[07:56] <Cyber_Stalker> brb
[07:56] <nikolai> How do i add more?
[07:56] <DShepherd> simplechat, well.. windows cd would :-). i guess if you dont need the data then reformat to ntfs
[07:56] <tenemag> dystopianray: it says "please insert CD"
[07:56] <DShepherd> simplechat, if you can live with ext3 then do that
[07:56] <nikolai> nvm i do have my desktop set to 4
[07:56] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: on ur desktop switcher on the panel, right click and hit properties...4 colums
[07:57] <fatcatmatt> columns*
[07:57] <dystopianray> tenemag: remove the cd from your apt sources
[07:57] <binger> how do i creat a new initrd.img without missing UUID errors?
[07:57] <fantasia> com
[07:57] <simplechat> DShepherd: Damn, what is with the brittleness of ubuntu's ntfs drivers!
[07:57] <tenemag> dystopianray: it's not in there :-\
[07:57] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: fix it?
[07:57] <simplechat> DShepherd: i have an external (ntfs) hard drive, and although it will mount (and unmount) in windows, it won't run at all in linux
[07:57] <DShepherd> simplechat, dont blame ubuntu. blame the person who wrote ntfs
[07:57] <cLINTo> <cLINTo> does anyone know if it's possible to use the same /home for multiple distros?
[07:57] <cLINTo> <cLINTo> I was thinking it may cause conflicts considering some configuration files are located there, but what if I used a different username for the different distros?
[07:57] <DShepherd> persons*
[07:57] <tenemag> nvm fixed it
[07:57] <fatcatmatt> kk
[07:57] <dystopianray> tenemag:are you sure? it's not the very frst line?
[07:58] <dystopianray> cLINTo: it is possible
[07:58] <binger> can anyone hear me?
[07:58] <tenemag> didn't see the 2nd line ;)
[07:58] <dystopianray> binger: no
[07:58] <Apachez> where do I find documentation on how alternate cd 7.10 is constructed ?
[07:58] <nikolai> fatcatmatt the columns are set to 4 and rows 1
[07:58] <slaytanic> I have problems with Ubuntu hanging when suspending/hibernating, what should I be looking at to troubleshoot it?
[07:58] <lordprofit> simplechat: have you tried ntfs-3g?
[07:58] <DShepherd> simplechat, we really dont know how ntfs work. so most of the stuff that works is years of guess work and reverse engineering
[07:58] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: whats wrong then?
[07:58] <binger> dystopianray: thank you, that sthe first repsonse ive gotten in an hour
[07:58] <simplechat> DShepherd: yeah, but i don't get why i need to reboot my windows computer for it?
[07:58] <nikolai> it does not show 4 thats whats wrong.
[07:59] <rredd4> tenemag  go to System > Administration > Synaptic   then click on search, then type subversion in the search box
[07:59] <simplechat> lordprofit: its installed
[07:59] <DShepherd> simplechat, i dont know either.
[07:59] <lordprofit> k thought i'd ask
[07:59] <nikolai> and I dont get a cube i get a 2d surface the flips and rotates
[07:59] <lordprofit> what's your fstab look like for the ntfs?
[07:59] <weltschmerz> what's after gutsy?  that release, or the next one, is going to be the one where Ubuntu starts to hurt Windows.
[07:59] <simplechat> lordprofit: how would i find that out?
[07:59] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: hrmmm...i had the problem till i added more columns...i dunno what to say now
[07:59] <DShepherd> weltschmerz, hardy heron
[07:59] <darren> hello
[08:00] <lordprofit> less /etc/fstab
[08:00] <nikolai> fatcatmatt its ok, things like this will happen.maybe a restart will do it who know...
[08:00] <lordprofit> simplechat: look for the line with ntfs or ntfs-3g
[08:00] <weltschmerz> they should drop the adjective and just use the animal name.
[08:00] <rredd4> weltschmerz  hardy will be LTS
[08:00] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: before that, do a ctrl+alt+backspace
[08:00] <weltschmerz> lts?
[08:00] <simplechat> lordprofit: /dev/sdb1 /media/Data ntfs-3g defaults, locale=en_AU,UTF-8 0 0
[08:00] <tvst> long term support
[08:00] <fantasia> Hey can somebody help me with my audio... the sound card is picked, unmuted, codecs installed yet no sound
[08:00] <rredd4> !LTS
[08:00] <lordprofit> long term support i think
[08:01] <ubotu> LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[08:01] <nitalaut> hello guys, i've got strange problem with gutsy - in hungs while booting with nvidia fx5200 videocard inserted(if i use intergrated video card system boots normally)
[08:01] <weltschmerz> rredd4 meaning you can choose whether or not to pay for the support?
[08:01] <lordprofit> this is mine simplechat
[08:01] <danshtr|work> Hi all, I hame havin problem upgrading to 7.10. here is the message: Failed to fetch http://edevelop.org/~lut1n/ubuntu/dists/edgy/e17/binary-i386/Packages.gz 404 Not Found. why does it link to edgy?

[08:02] <tenemag> how do I select a theme with Emerald?
[08:02] <Cyber_Stalker> ubuntu is making me sad
[08:02] <DShepherd> simplechat, good
[08:02] <simplechat> why doesn't mount make its own mount points?
[08:02] <tvst> try installing mozilla-mplayer (if you're running a mozilla-based browser)
[08:02] <lordprofit> mine made its own mountpoint for ntfs
[08:02] <darren> tvst: thanks
[08:02] <tvst> the default player is totem, but i find mplayer better
[08:02] <lordprofit> i just had to change it to ntfs-3g when i upgraded
[08:03] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: did you restart your computer or just x (ctrl+alt+backspace)
[08:03] <tenemag> anyone know bout emerald?
[08:03] <simplyubuntu> !rootkit

[08:03] <rredd4> tenemag did you get subversion fixed?
[08:03] <BHSPitLappy> How can I disable ubuntu/gnome's control of an LCD backlight on a laptop?
[08:03] <Jymmm> tenemag: Ask Dorthy
[08:03] <tenemag> rredd4: yes
[08:03] <simplyubuntu> !Dorthy

[08:04] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dorthy - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[08:04] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: dorthy?
[08:04] <simplyubuntu> :P
[08:04] <darren> tvst: my videos play but they are corrupted.
[08:04] <tenemag> <-- can't spell lmao
[08:04] <nikolai> how do i put an image so it shows in the background when the cube rotates
[08:04] <lordprofit> rootkit=nasty evil stuff
[08:04] <Crav> based on forum posts, etc, it appears that i shouldn't upgrade to gutsy, any strong reasons why i should?
[08:04] <tvst> darren:that's strange. do you have a link to the videos?
[08:04] <fantasia> ------------- Does anybody know about getting sound to work in ubuntu
[08:04] <BHSPitLappy> tenemag, the name is typically spelled Dorothy
[08:04] <tenemag> perhaps i can, no clue
[08:04] <tenemag> lol
[08:04] <Jymmm> tenemag: It was a joke.... as in Dorthy and toto, the scarecrow, lion,,, ringing a bell?
[08:04] <nikolai> fatcat i just ctr alt backspace
[08:04] <darren> tvst: youtube
[08:04] <simplyubuntu> lordprofit which does what?
[08:05] <tenemag> hahahahahahaha
[08:05] <Apachez> anyone in here who have tried the encrypted installation of ubuntu 7.10 alternate cd ?
[08:05] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: in the settings of compiz
[08:05] <tenemag> yes yes
[08:05] <tvst> ah, so it's flash that you need.
[08:05] <Fyda> Eek. The dist upgrade left me with a system that boots up to a black screen of death.
[08:05] <darren> tvst: the bottom bars are all overlapping
[08:05] <lordprofit> simplechat: the ntfs-3g?
[08:05] <tenemag> lol hey, you never know, some weird package could be called Dorthy
[08:05] <tenemag> lol
[08:05] <Geoffrey2> when booting from the Gutsy live CD, I'm getting around a lockup problem by typing hpet=disable in the boot options
[08:05] <BHSPitLappy> !info dorothy
[08:05] <ubotu> Package dorothy does not exist in gutsy
[08:05] <tvst> darren: are you using flash or gnash?
[08:05] <Jymmm> tenemag: Yeha, you have a point =)
[08:05] <Fyda> Recovery mode is not much better, as all the network interfaces have been disabled so I can't do anything with apt...
[08:05] <BHSPitLappy> nope
[08:05] <Cyber_Stalker> whats the command i use that will show me the name of my sound card?
[08:05] <simplyubuntu> lordprofit?
[08:05] <lordprofit> oh the rootkit?
[08:05] <darren> tvst: both
[08:05] <simplyubuntu> yep
[08:05] <darren> tvst: it prompted for both installs
[08:05] <tenemag> seriously though, how do I switch themes in Emerald?
[08:05] <tenemag> :-\ lol
[08:05] <Fyda> What's the command to re-enable network interfaces?
[08:05] <mog_> hello
[08:05] <Fyda> tenemag: emerald-theme-manager, perhaps?
[08:06] <tvst> darren: strange. did you try reinstalling flash? aptitude reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
[08:06] <darren> tvst: I installed gnash and reloaded and it asked to install flash and I installed that too
[08:06] <nikolai> fatcat can you be more specific in the compiz config all i have are options to enable different effects and such, not where i can load my image
[08:06] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: hit alt+f2 and type emerald --release
[08:06] <tenemag> Fyda: tried that
[08:06] <tenemag> fatcatmatt: aight hold on
[08:06] <mboso> I just upgraded to gutsy, and i only have one out of two CPUs recgonize. Athalon dual core
[08:06] <tvst> darren: gnash will probably not work well for youtube (i never tried, but i read somewhere it's compatible with flash up to 7 only.)
[08:06] <`eric-> how do you make a launcher open your 'home' folder... it says "invalid file location: file:///eric"
[08:06] <`eric-> ?
[08:06] <mboso> should I be using a special kernel?
[08:06] <Cyber_Stalker> why does every body seem to be ignoring me? its 1 command to list devices
[08:06] <Geoffrey2> however, now that I installed Gutsy, I'm not sure how to apply that option when booting from the hard drive
[08:06] <tenemag> fatcatmatt: it's already released :-\
[08:07] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: i mean emerald --replace
[08:07] <simplechat> lordprofit: so what would you suggest?
[08:07] <darren> tvst: how to uninstall gnash?
[08:07] <klos> is there already a .deb for vmware for gutsy ???
[08:07] <lordprofit> for...the rootkit?  ;)
[08:07] <tvst> aptitude purge gnash
[08:07] <Cyber_Stalker> `eric-: use /home/eric
[08:07] <Cyber_Stalker> ?
[08:07] <lordprofit> look on wikipedia
[08:07] <darren> tvst: thanks
[08:07] <nikolai> fatcat can you be more specific in the compiz config all i have are options to enable different effects and such, not where i can load my image
[08:07] <`eric-> Cyber_Stalker: ty
[08:08] <fatcatmatt> tenemag: fix it?
[08:08] <Cyber_Stalker> haha pleasure `eric-  :D
[08:08] <simplyubuntu> will do lordprofit.. in the meantime, whats wrong with the envy script? as in why is it so notorious?
[08:08] <rredd4> Cyber_Stakler  lspci
[08:08] <Cyber_Stalker> thank you rredd4
[08:08] <rredd4> yw
[08:08] <Ryuho> how would you increase your main partition? you can't boot from your usual OS because that's the partition you are changing right?
[08:08] <darren> tvst: thanks its all working now =)
[08:08] <tvst> darren: good!
[08:08] <lordprofit> envy script?  i must have missed part of the conversation
[08:09] <fatcatmatt> ryuho: is there already data on the partition?
[08:09] <giany911> guys i have some problems with gutsy and 5.1 sound ...
[08:09] <simplyubuntu> supposedly its a script that automates the installation of nvidia/ati drivers...
[08:09] <Ryuho> i have ubuntu installed, i just deleted my xp partition and is interested in adding it to ubuntu
[08:09] <simplyubuntu> !envy
[08:09] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[08:09] <TwoD> Argh... been trying everything I can think of, still can't get the Appearance Preferences window to update when clicking something
[08:09] <lordprofit> oh i have no clue
[08:09] <rredd4> Cyber_Stakler  you should see something about audio controller
[08:09] <fatcatmatt> ryuho: dont know that you can increase it once it's set.  if anything, try using gparted
[08:09] <lordprofit> i don't have a need for advanced graphics so i don't futz with that stuff
[08:10] <simplyubuntu> youre lucky
[08:10] <riotkittie> Ryuho: you could use gparted on a ubuntu live CD if you have one on hand, or download the actual gparted live cd
[08:10] <simplyubuntu> i cant stay away from them :D
[08:10] <Cyber_Stalker> yea rredd4 i know what im looking for just didnt know how to find it :D but this doesnt fix my sound problem
[08:10] <lordprofit> yah just a simple coder :)  if i want games i have an xbox
[08:10] <simplechat> lordprofit: so, i need a windows cd, chkdsk the other drive then restart and it should come up?
[08:10] <Colro> Does anyone know if there's a way to temporarily disable xserver-xgl without having to uninstall it? I need to disable it every time I want to play a particular game with WINE, and uninstalling/reinstalling and rebooting every time is kind of annoying and cumbersome.
[08:10] <Ryuho> riotkittie cool i have liveCD
[08:10] <thedefender> anyone know of a good widget system that goes well with compizfusion desktop transparency
[08:10] <Ryuho> thanks
[08:10] <lordprofit> simplechat: lost again-what are you referring to?
[08:10] <thedefender> gdesklets does  not
[08:10] <dystopianray> Colro: you don't need to reboot just press ctrl+alt+backspace
[08:10] <rredd4> Cyber_Stalker  tell us your sound problem
[08:11] <simplechat> lordprofit: ntfs stuffups, again
[08:11] <riotkittie> Ryuho: i'm not sure if gparted's on the LiveCDs prior to gutsy, if not you can apt-get install it while using the live disc
[08:11] <simplyubuntu> lordprofit if youre wondering where i thought of rootkits from, its from a user called riotkittie
[08:11] <simplyubuntu> :P
[08:11] <`eric-> how do i change the icon's name on the desktop ("sda1") to like... "ntfs" or something?
[08:11] <`eric-> lol
[08:11] <Ryuho> ok
[08:11] <Cyber_Stalker> rredd4: there is no defualt, for some reason also isnt detecting my sound card
[08:11] <lordprofit> then yes-chkdsk it.  are you on XP/2000?
[08:11] <rredd4> Cyber_Stalker  not that I can help tho...
[08:11] <Jban> Can someone help me with a USB sound issue?
[08:11] <fatcatmatt> colro: add/remove > boot up manager (may have ur settings u want)
[08:11] <simplechat> lordprofit: was on xp
[08:11] <phrost> anyone use kexec often?
[08:11] <simplechat> lordprofit: ubuntu killed the xp install, so now i'm stuck without it
[08:11] <simplechat> lordprofit: i have found an install disk tho
[08:11] <rredd4> Cyber_Stalker  ask others please
[08:11] <Colro> fatcatmatt: thanks, ill try it out
[08:12] <riotkittie> how did ubuntu kill an xp install?
[08:12] <fatcatmatt> kk colro
[08:12] <lordprofit> oh.  you need to do more than chkdsk then.  you need to reinstall the boot manager for NTFS....trying to remember how to do that
[08:12] <fatcatmatt> simplechat: get an iso of windows and start over :)
[08:12] <rredd4> riotkittie  depends how you installed it
[08:12] <Colro> dystopianray: I know, that's what I meant, it's just annoying to have to uninstall/reinstall it so often.
[08:12] <riotkittie> Boot with the WinXp install CD, enter recovery console, FIXMBR lordprofit
[08:12] <riotkittie> or fixboot
[08:13] <simplechat> riotkittie: corrupted the partition table, each and every time i tried. (i tried for the best part of a week, ~30 installs.)
[08:13] <lordprofit> ah yes
[08:13] <dystopianray> Colro: so stop using it, get nvidia graphics
[08:13] <Jban> I need some USB help
[08:13] <simplechat> fixboot made the machine dead, unbootable
[08:13] <simplechat> both partitions unreadable
[08:13] <Jban> sound
[08:13] <lordprofit> linky for your reference simplechat:
[08:13] <lordprofit> http://www.eddieoneverything.com/windows-xp/uninstalling-the-ubuntu-linux-boot-manager.php
[08:13] <simplechat> and playing around with grub didn't work
[08:13] <Ryuho> the accessibility package should allow a user to use the onboard keyboard to type in the user name and the password. this is important not only for handicapped user but also for tablets where you have no keyboard connected.
[08:13] <Ryuho> was this fixed?
[08:14] <lordprofit> usually though it ends up totally hosed
[08:14] <Ryuho> it's a bug report on 7.10
[08:14] <Colro> dystopianray: If only I could afford a new gfx card atm :(
[08:14] <lordprofit> and you *do* have to reinstall
[08:14] <dystopianray> Colro: get a geforce fx 5200, they're really cheap
[08:14] <riotkittie> Ryuho: if the bug report isnt marked as close, it's a safe guess no
[08:14] <simplechat> lordprofit: i'm already reinstalling to gusty nowish
[08:14] <riotkittie> s/close/closled
[08:14] <riotkittie> closed. argh.
[08:15] <Ryuho> how is that not implemented :( on screenkeyboard?
[08:15] <simplechat> lordprofit: i've tried fsking with the boot loader, left my computer unbootable
[08:15] <tenemag> aight, bit of a crisis guys... umm  I have no clue what happened but now I have no menu on the top of the screen 0_o
[08:15] <riotkittie> Ryuho: no clue. it's crazy. :|
[08:15] <lordprofit> i'd start totally fresh
[08:15] <Ryuho> i guess that's the down side to open source OS
[08:15] <tenemag> the laptop's battery died and now I have no menu bar
[08:15] <`eric-> how do i change the icon's name on the desktop ("sda1") to like... "ntfs" or something?
[08:15] <BHSPitLappy> How can I disable ubuntu/gnome's control of an LCD backlight on a laptop?
[08:15] <lordprofit> do you have stuff on the windows install you need?
[08:15] <_blitz_> i downloaded the latest firefox tar.gz file.how do i install it.somebody please help
[08:16] <lordprofit> _blitz_: why not use apt?
[08:16] <tenemag> now what do I do :-\
[08:16] <riotkittie> `eric-: you'll need to change the drive's mountpoint in /etc/fstab
[08:16] <simplechat> _blitz_: why didn't you just use apt?
[08:16] <lordprofit> you don't *really* want to build FF from source do you?
[08:16] <simplechat> lordprofit: great minds think alike?
[08:16] <lordprofit> lol
[08:16] <Sorcererbob> could someone please help me. I've just installed 7.10 and have compiz working well indeed. The only problem I have is when I rotate the cube, it snaps into the desired desktop very slowly, kinda wobbling around a bit before becoming usable. Its only a quarter of a second wait, but its annoying. I can't find the setting to make it snap back faster. Could someone please direct me to it.
[08:16] <jiger> hello all. am facing a severe problem with upgrding to gusty
[08:16] <_blitz_> how ? i am a newbie and not familiar
[08:16] <riotkittie> latest firefox = 3.0?
[08:16] <tenemag> lordprofit: lol building FF from source...  memories of gentoo...  longest compile EVER
[08:16] <lordprofit> sudo apt-get install firefox
[08:16] <eddie_> Hi everyone
[08:17] <lordprofit> but you should already have it on ubuntu....
[08:17] <tenemag> seriously though, how can I get my menu bars back?
[08:17] <jiger> I am not able to mount /usr though that partion exists
[08:17] <tenemag> I used ALT-F2 to get to IRC just so I could ask lol
=== ubuntu__ is now known as oahong
[08:17] <BHSPitLappy> jiger, you have a separate /usr partition?
[08:17] <_blitz_> thanks guys
[08:17] <riotkittie> tenemag: gnome-panel?   or something else?
[08:17] <jiger> on booting fsck fails wiht error 8, superblock blah blah error
[08:17] <lordprofit> anyways simplechat: you could just reinstall windows fresh
[08:17] <jiger> yes
[08:17] <Sorcererbob> tenemag: can you just execute "metacity" to restore the nominal window manager?
[08:17] <eddie_> I have put Ubuntu on my laptop and internet is not working.  I was wondering if it does not have the driver although PCLinuxOS worked from installation
[08:17] <lordprofit> that almost always fixes that danged MBR problem
[08:18] <xiij> odd, Gusty comes with Firefox 2.0.0.6 but the latest version is 2.0.0.8 according to firefox.com
[08:18] <vega-> xiij: whats so odd about that?
[08:18] <tenemag> nope
[08:18] <BHSPitLappy> xiij, point?
[08:18] <eddie_> It is NetLink BCM5787M Gigibit Ethernet PCI Express
[08:18] <PaPaFD> Sorcererbob:  Try Shift+F10
[08:18] <jiger> but running livecd of 6.06 loads that partion fine
[08:18] <tenemag> Sorcererbob: tried it :-\
[08:18] <xiij> just curious why gusty would ship an older version
[08:18] <lordprofit> xiij: meh-2.0.0.8 just came out
[08:18] <eddie_> Anybody know where I can get driver from?
[08:18] <BHSPitLappy> xiij, gutsy comes with the version that was out when firefox was pulled in.  .8 is really new.
[08:19] <vega-> xiij: of course there can't be latest versions of everything, there needs to be time to test stuff
[08:19] <Jban> How do I get all of my laptop sound to come out through my USB headset?  Skype / Pidgin use the headset, but a DVD movie or Youtube do not.  I already have it selected in the sound options.... any ideas?
[08:19] <riotkittie> maybe 2.0.0.6 was the version available when gutsy froze?
[08:19] <Sorcererbob> PaPaFD: that changed it in such a way that it took 5 seconds to be usable instead of 1/4 second
[08:19] <xiij> ok, fair enough, I would think though the newer one would be in the respostiory
[08:19] <lordprofit> you'll be fine with v2006
[08:19] <BHSPitLappy> xiij, enable backports.
[08:19] <jiger> somebody please guide how force detech of my partion which for some weird reason is not being displayed though fdisk shows my partion
[08:19] <Sorcererbob> now all the effects are going SUPER slow
[08:19] <riotkittie> Jban: still looking for help? :o  have you tried posting at ubuntuforums.org ? someone there may be able to answer
[08:19] <Sorcererbob> what does Shift+F10 do?
[08:19] <tenemag> it has to be something with Emerald....
[08:19] <Jban> lol every time I post no one answers
[08:19] <BHSPitLappy> xiij, aside from security updates, you stick with the versions of software that were out when the Ubuntu version was released
[08:19] <jMerliNz> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/154354
[08:20] <PaPaFD> its a toggle hit it again
[08:20] <jMerliNz> was there ever an answer to this bug?
[08:20] <lordprofit> jban: you ask the tough questions that's why
[08:20] <xiij> ok, that's fine I guess.
[08:20] <Sorcererbob> aha, very good
[08:20] <riotkittie> jMerliNz: if the bug's not marked as close, i'd assume no
[08:20] <Sorcererbob> ok, that was the opposite of what I wanted
[08:20] <lordprofit> i'd guess not a lot of people use USB headsets
[08:20] <Jban> lordprofit: Look, you know, someone has to around here *puts on Jack Bauer face*
[08:20] <lordprofit> lol
[08:20] <Sorcererbob> I'm thinking it would be in the desktop cube or rotate cube settings. I just can't identify which one
[08:20] <Jban> "DAMNIT!"
[08:20] <Jban> lol :P
[08:20] <marx2k> Interesting...Im sharing a folder on the SMB network, yet other computers cant see it... wonder why that is
[08:20] <lordprofit> ugh SMB
[08:21] <Sorcererbob> firewall, marx2k?
[08:21] <Jban> hahaha
[08:21] <lordprofit> go old skool and access it thru FTP
[08:21] <rredd4> Jban  get a headset with a plug on it.  a mini plug   that will solve your problem
[08:21] <marx2k> not running any...this is a default gutsy install
[08:21] <Sorcererbob> ssh in from the local network :rolleyes: :P
[08:21] <lordprofit> firewall on the SMB share?
[08:21] <marx2k> lordprofit, SMB makes it a lot easier for other clients
[08:21] <Jban> rredd4: What?
[08:21] <lordprofit> yah i know :P i was half joking
[08:21] <Jban> rredd4: It's recognised by Ubuntu
[08:21] <marx2k> lordprofit, its a default gutsy installed...no firewall should be working
[08:21] <tenemag> Sorcererbob: any other ideas on how to get the menu back?
[08:22] <nitalaut> hello guys, i've got strange problem with gutsy - in hungs while booting with nvidia fx5200 videocard inserted(if i use intergrated video card system boots normally)
[08:22] <robotphood> anyone know how i can bind my mouse back/forward buttons to work in konqueror/dolphin
[08:22] <BHSPitLappy> marx2k, try \\IP.OF.UBUNTU.BOX\NameOfShare in a windows address bar
[08:22] <eegore> I am getting superblock errors when I try to mount an xfs files system, is there a recorerry or is it hosed
[08:22] <lordprofit> oh sorry; misunderstood
[08:22] <Sorcererbob> tenemag: sorry mate. I'm not a pro at all. Is it the title bars that have disappeared when you run compiz? cause nvidia cards used to have some serious problems with compiz/beryl
[08:23] <mdalek> has anyone noticed that gdm login screen to usable desktop loading time is like 10times slower on gutsy
[08:23] <tenemag> it's an ATI card....  and no, just the nice GNOME Menu off the top that shows the time, date, battery, wifi, etc
[08:23] <tenemag> like the WHOLE bar is missing
[08:23] <marx2k> BHSPitLappy: Yeah I was hoping it wouldnt have to come to that
[08:23] <Sorcererbob> oh. OH. Thats rather odd indeed!
[08:23] <riotkittie> mdalek: no. i have noticed that on my default install, the resolution sucks, tho :P
[08:23] <Jban> I'd rather go through Season3 of 24 than have to keep asking, but I refuse to go to bed without victory :P
[08:23] <Sorcererbob> I'll google it :)
[08:23] <BHSPitLappy> marx2k, aside from that, you have workgroup issues to figure out
[08:23] <mdalek> it takes longer to get to desktop from login than to boot from bios to login :(
[08:23] <marx2k> uh uh
[08:23] <tenemag> lol aight...
[08:23] <BHSPitLappy> marx2k, digging into samba configuration and what not.
[08:23] <mdalek> and my hdd is thrashing.... i've got 1gig ram :(
[08:23] <tenemag> <-- hopes he doesn't have to re-install AGAIN
[08:23] <tenemag> lol
[08:24] <marx2k> yeah *sigh*
[08:24] <riotkittie> tenemag: ALT + F2  killall gnome-panel
[08:24] <BHSPitLappy> tenemag, possible that you right-clicked and chose Delete This Panel by accident
[08:25] <tenemag> ah it's back!!
[08:25] <riotkittie> tenemag: or did you perhaps delete that panel?  >_>  if it's just flubbed, killing it will respawn it and it should work ok
=== dmx is now known as _Christian
[08:25] <BHSPitLappy> marx2k, might be more helpful to bring it up in #samba
[08:25] <tenemag> that worked
[08:25] <tenemag> lol
[08:25] <tenemag> I must have done that when the system crashed out on me
[08:25] <tenemag> lol
[08:25] <Jban> lordprofit: And yeah, I have posted on Ubuntuforums, but they reply once every 10 hours, so it's hard to get real help.
[08:26] <lordprofit> itching to get on skype? ;)
[08:26] <simplechat> yeah
[08:26] <Jban> I have Skype
[08:26] <lordprofit> but with your headset i meant
[08:26] <Jban> yeah it works
[08:26] <Jban> Skype / Pidgin sounds come through it
[08:26] <Jban> YouTube / DVD do not
[08:27] <rredd4> Jban  go to yahoo.com click on images  type mini plug   to see what I am talking about
[08:27] <Jban> rredd4 click on images?
[08:27] <Jban> you mean an actual image
[08:27] <Boumboum6> rredd4: that's the stereo 2.5mm plug--the kind you see on those iPods?
[08:28] <rredd4> yes
[08:28] <Jban> rredd4: But every image is a link to something?
[08:28] <CarlFK> what package has "git" the source control client?
[08:29] <riotkittie> CarlFK: git, maybe
[08:29] <DShepherd> git?
[08:29] <Boumboum6> rredd4: that's what I use now...I'm on a laptop and due to my hearing problem I listenn to everything via my earbuds. Ubuntu's worked well for me--my only issue is the sound isn't as loud as I can get it in Windows XP.
[08:29] <DShepherd> !find git

[08:31] <DShepherd> OMGWTFBBQ, have you install the glib dev files?

[08:32] <OMGWTFBBQ> well. this is a fresh install. i searched the package manager but there are only about a million "lib"-like entries. also, i'm new to linux in general :/
[08:32] <marx2k> grumble grumble...stupid samba
[08:32] <OMGWTFBBQ> i got xchat installed through the add/remove programs and installed it off the disc, but i couldn't get it to compile on my own
[08:32] <Jban> DShepherd: LOL! I thought you were making fun of someone, Shep... until I saw the guy's actualy name talk back.
[08:32] <CarlFK> riotkittie: git-buildpackage was it.  thanks
[08:32] <DShepherd> OMGWTFBBQ, libglib2.0-dev is what you might be looking for

[08:33] <kilopopo> is there a gfxbootmenu for ubuntu?

[08:33] <CarlFK> there won't be as many questions if you do that
[08:33] <DShepherd> pooka, something about libxml2?

[08:36] <tokyoahead> hi all.. I upgraded to 7.10 and want to have the sotware sources for the unsupported software such as beryl and thunderbird... what urls do I have to use?
[08:36] <pooyak> guess nothing I can do right now but I hope this machine atleast boots after this upgrade
[08:36] <heartsblood> petru: increase standby time or disable it
[08:37] <ppcguy> tokyoahead.. go out and grab automatix

[08:37] <ppcguy> if you want the easy way
[08:37] <dexter> mistell
[08:37] <petru> heartsblood, where to find this settings/ monitor options?
[08:37] <riotkittie> !automatix
[08:37] <ubotu> Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.  A creditable analysis from a debian/ubuntu developer is here - http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html (Additional information: /msg ubotu worksforme)
[08:37] <pooyak> er, I should have waited a few more days after the release before actually upgrade my machine
[08:37] <Heaven> does anyone know any software for ubuntu that can manage packages and .bz2 files without using terminal lines and just browse through folders ... ? (I want to install something and i just can't do it through terminal im not good with it)
[08:37] <dystopianray> tokyoahead: thunderbird is in the repos, beryl is now compiz-fusion which is in the repos
[08:37] <DShepherd> pooyak, is it still installing?
[08:37] <zethero1> has anyone gotten thinkfinger working in Gutsy?
[08:38] <kilopopo> ubuntu ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[08:38] <DShepherd> pooyak, the update that is
[08:38] <pooyak> DShepherd, yes it is. setting up tomboy?!
[08:38] <QCODE> tokyoahead: Have you tried: aptitude search beryl    ?
[08:38] <riotkittie> tokyoahead: why do you want to use beryl? isnt it a discontinued project? and compiz-fusion's preinstalled. thunderbird should be in the repos.
[08:38] <marx2k> Hmm... I can smb://192.168.11.4 and see my remote samba shares, but the workgroup that samba server is on ("WORKGROUP") does not show up in samba listings... whats up with that
[08:38] <DShepherd> pooka, ok. when it is finished . run apt-get -f install to fix any problems
[08:38] <petru> heartsblood, where to find this settings/ monitor options?
[08:38] <bada> so, nobody know how to fix NVIDIA?

[08:45] <DShepherd> petru, see if dim display when idle is available... some setting should help you out there..
[08:45] <riotkittie> 1 things not working out of the box doesnt mean the new version is bad, it means things dont work out of the box. not the end of the world. 2 - why tell us? devs dont hang out here. 3 - rather than complaining about something you're not paying for, try filing a bug report if you're that bothered about it.

[08:46] <Hadeshorn> Hey whats the command to list all active network connections to my machine
[08:46] <pooyak> DShepherd, it seems like the upgrade itself detected that some of the packages failed to install and is now reinstalling them or something
[08:47] <Hadeshorn> because my network activity monitor is going nuts and im not doing anything
[08:47] <DShepherd> pooyak, that might be a good thing :-)
[08:47] <eshaase> which file do i download for the network-based installer?

[08:47] <mcp_dk> I am really excited about compiz/fusion in 7.10 but how do i expand from 2 desktops to e.g. 4 so i can get that cube thing coing?
[08:47] <pooyak> DShepherd, now the upgrade window is closed without any message! guess I will run the apt-get now

[08:47] <DShepherd> pooyak, ok kool
[08:48] <riotkittie> eshaase: i'm not suuuuuure that ubuntu has a network based installer.  like debian's? i dont think it does. [i may be wrong]
[08:48] <nightswim> mcp_dk: right click on the workspaces in the down right corner
[08:48] <nightswim> mcp_dk: and adjust the number of desktops
[08:48] <pooyak> DShepherd, oops! can you say the command again. cleared everything by mistak
[08:48] <pooyak> apt-get -f upgrade?
[08:48] <Boumboum6> vsayikiran: I don't think this server has any special IRC commands--it responds to all the standard IRC commands.
[08:48] <vsayikiran> Boumboum: from where i can learn irc commands
[08:48] <DShepherd> pooyak, apt-get -f install
[08:48] <riotkittie> mcp_dk: you have compizconfig-settings-manager installed?
[08:48] <Boumboum6> riotkittie: since Ubuntu is based on Debian, if Debian has a network based installer, I'm pretty sure Ubuntu does, too.
[08:49] <mcp_dk> i have set it to 2 columns and 2 rows (which to my mathematical skills hould amount to 4) but still i can only fli between 2 desktops

[08:49] <bdgraue_> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Spca5xx#head-032065f8a5fb6a485a7985ddb3a40262a0629fe5    since dapper it worked out-of-the-box ! but now ... nothing
[08:49] <aeshyamae> can i stop that installation and do another one with pppoeconf now enabled?
[08:49] <vsayikiran> Boumboum: do you know any website from where i can learn commands
[08:49] <Boumboum6> vsayikiran: are you using mIRC? Or what irc server are you using? (click on "help" in mIRC and it will list the commands for you..

[08:49] <Dark> Hello
[08:49] <pooyak> DShepherd, nothing happend. just a bunch of unused packages
[08:49] <monte84> hello
[08:49] <Dark> Whats up?
[08:49] <oyzcha> hello
[08:49] <vsayikiran> Boumboum: i am using freenode
[08:50] <Boumboum6> vsayikiran: yes. Let me look up a site for you... one moment pls...
[08:50] <monte84> not much, trying to figure a few thigns out
[08:50] <DShepherd> pooyak, ok. well you seem to be fine
[08:50] <riotkittie> mcp_dk: 4 horizontal virtual size, 1 for the other two options [ i assume you are using ccsm]
[08:50] <Boumboum6> freenode is the server, not the program you're using to get on freenode. :)
[08:50] <DShepherd> pooyak, hope things just work from here on :-)
[08:50] <Heaven> The program 'apt' can be found in the following packages:
[08:50] <Heaven>  * sun-java5-jdk
[08:50] <Heaven>  * sun-java6-jdk
[08:50] <Heaven> Try: sudo apt-get install <selected package>
[08:50]  * pooyak crosses fingers and reboots...
[08:50] <vsayikiran> Boumboum: basically i am using gaim messenger isi it ok
[08:50] <Dark> Oh I am trying to find programmers to help me with my open source project Alpha Z3l3
[08:50] <DShepherd> vsayikiran, http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/new2irc.html -- here's a website.
[08:50] <mcp_dk> riotkitte: thanks that worked. Ubuntu rocks!!
[08:50] <dystopianray> Dark: what is your project?
[08:51] <riotkittie> mcp_dk: :)
[08:51] <monte84> need  to block a game from getting access to the internet, i have firestarter setup, not quite sure what to do though. Using Ubuntu 7.10
[08:51] <DShepherd> Heaven, sudo apt-get install  sauerbraten.
[08:51] <pooyak> wow! black boot screen....
[08:51] <Dark> It is a game maker for linux (Ubuntu
[08:51] <Boumboum6> Vsayikiran: rather than give you just one site.... a quick google search will give you many... click on any of the links here  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=irc+commands&btnG=Google+Search
[08:51] <DShepherd> Heaven, dont paste here next time. use the paste bin
[08:51] <Colro> My GTK theme makes several windows in Azureus completely unreadable -- is there a way to make it ignore themes and/or use its own?
[08:51] <aeshyamae> i am from ubuntu live cd and the installation stand still at 82% is it badd to stop that installation and start a new one?
[08:52] <tokyoahead> guys how can I make sure that compiz is beeing used? I configured it but it does not seem to be switch on?
[08:52] <Boumboum6> monte84: Ubuntu has a built-in firewall. You need to enter the firewall and set it to block the games.
[08:52] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: disconnect from the internet, it'll finish and then come back in here
[08:52] <riotkittie> aeshyamae: how long has it been stuck there?  if you hit the caps lock or number lock, do the keyboard lights respond?
[08:52] <monte84> Boumboum6, yes, just not sure how to do that
[08:52] <zethero1> when I install something with "make install" is there a way to uninstall as well?
[08:52] <dystopianray> zethero1: no
[08:52] <Boumboum6> aeshyamae: Not really...but you'll need to reinstall from the start.
[08:52] <aeshyamae> 10-15mins at 82% configuring the apt scanning the mirrors
[08:52] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: disconnect from the internet for it to finish
[08:52] <Heaven> seems it's working thanks a million years
[08:52] <Heaven> :D
[08:53] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: it's not going to do anything otherwise
[08:53] <pooyak> woohooo!
[08:53] <bdgraue_> dystopianray: any idea how to get my webcam running? i try it since days, worked very well with feisty
[08:53] <riotkittie> zethero1: use checkinstall for that.  you can find it in the repos, then you make & checkinstall rather than makeinstall
[08:53]  * pooyak is on 7.10 now
[08:53] <dystopianray> bdgraue_: no idea sorry
[08:53] <Dark> I have been working on it very slowly but I am still in school
[08:53] <ExRarne> Ugh... I decreased the size of the XP partiton, installed Ubuntu and everything was going fine, I installed a few programs etc... I login today and Ubuntu isn't accepting my password. I boot into windows, it's going crazy, explorer isn't working, the screen is frozen (except for mIRC which I was able to boot up via TaskMan)... What the fuck is going on?
[08:53] <DShepherd> tokyoahead, go to system - prefs - appearance. and check out the visual effect tab
[08:53] <riotkittie> yaaaaay pooyak.
[08:53] <aeshyamae> dystopianray: but it is stand still for 10-15 before configuring the pppoeconf itself
[08:53]  * pooyak loves the new background colors
[08:54] <zethero1> riotkittie: so now that I have installed something with make install, there is no way to remove it?
[08:54] <Boumboum6> ExRarne: sounds to me like one of the installs overwrote the other. :(   (a  newbie guess)
[08:54] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: oh it got stuck before you connected to the internet?
[08:54] <aeshyamae> riotkittie: i am from the installation live cd so the whole system is not stuck
[08:54] <aeshyamae> ya
[08:54] <freezeman> Hi! Anyone have a working xorg.conf for ati radeon 9200 pro?'
[08:54] <DShepherd> Heaven, np. that;s what friends are for :-).
[08:54] <ExRarne> Would the best solution would be going to GpartED via the liveCD and restore the original size of XP?
[08:54] <monte84> dont guess anyone here is running ubuntu with an HD2900 card eh?
[08:54] <riotkittie> ExRarne: can you chkdsk your win partition?   do you have restore points available?  [though i cant imagine ubuntu would have caused such issues with xp]
[08:54] <bdgraue_>  {USB_DEVICE(0x0c45, 0x613c)},       /* Sonix Pccam168 */   this is the webcam i have, it does appear in lsusb but i can't get it running, it should work but id did not
[08:54] <DShepherd> pooyak, I love the animal wallpaper
[08:54] <Boumboum6> Quick google search, Ubuntu firewall settings  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=ubuntu+firewall+settings&btnG=Search
[08:55] <aeshyamae> dystopianray: ya but the app is responding system is working only the installation is standstill thats the problem
[08:55] <Colro> My GTK theme makes several windows in Azureus completely unreadable -- is there a way to make it ignore themes and/or use its own?
[08:55] <Boumboum6> ExRarne: no the best solution is to restore from your backups that hopefully you did before the installs.
[08:55] <ExRarne> I'm chkdsk'ing the system
[08:55] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: it got stuck when i did a few installs and I pulled the ethernet and it proceeding, the servers it is checking are too hammered to respond properly
[08:55] <riotkittie> zethero1: no, not usually. sometimes you can make uninstall but it depends on how the package was put together and whatnot
[08:55] <DUUUUUDE> i am really impressed by ubuntu/xubuntu/kubuntu. wow!
[08:56] <aeshyamae> dystopianray:a fresh install from start will not do any harm ok?
[08:56] <ExRarne> Boumboum6: I didn't corrupt any files, Windows is just going CRAZY for no reason, but I'm still able to run apps and files manually using TaskMan
[08:56] <DUUUUUDE> i am now a full linux :)
[08:56] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: it won't do any harm but it wil get stuck again
[08:56] <DUUUUUDE> user
[08:56] <simplechat> DUUUUUDE: good on ya!
[08:56] <Boumboum6> DUUUUDE: heh. It's one of the best Distros of linux I've seen...first one that recognized my wifi, my widescreen, and my nvidia video card right out of the box. :)
[08:56] <dystopianray> ExRarne: try #windows
[08:56] <freezeman> Hi! Anyone have a working xorg.conf for ati radeon 9200 pro? Start a private chat if u have
[08:56] <aeshyamae> dystopianray: opps then what to do?even without net it will stuck?
[08:57] <ExRarne> I'm convinced the error was somewhere within the install
[08:57] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: i'm not sure, it shouldn't do anything with no net
[08:57] <critt> upgraded to 7.10 now I have no sound playing avi files with any player.  Anyone know what I can do to fix this?
[08:57] <Boumboum6> there's a distro based on Ubuntu called Mint.....has a green theme instead of Ubuntu's orangish-brown...also better multimedia support in the box.
[08:57] <simplechat> wow, gusties default backround looks pretty damn hot :)
[08:57] <NorthByNorthWest> Hi all! Just installed Gibbon... then installed Azureus... it wont start (well... it quits when started)... running from terminal gives: http://pastebin.com/m4049542a Any ideas how to fix this?
[08:57] <aeshyamae> dystopianray: ok anyway trying once more is the only option for me no?
[08:57] <riotkittie> gutsy's default background looked pretty darn ugly, in my book :P
[08:57] <Boumboum6> ExRarne: sounds to me like your partitioning was screwed up...overlapping partitions.. That is a guess. You need to check that.
[08:57] <dystopianray> aeshyamae: I guess
[08:58] <pooyak> DShepherd, which one is animal. can't see their names
[08:58] <zethero1> is there a way to unload a module that I have manually loaded?
[08:58] <aeshyamae> ok thanks ill try
[08:58] <void^> NorthByNorthWest: install sun-java6-jre and get azureus at azureus.sf.net
[08:58] <Boumboum6> I agree wi th riotkittie...luckily it's highly modifiable. :)
[08:58] <ExRarne> Boumboum6: Well I have the specs for the original partition, perhaps deleting the Ubuntu ones and restoring the orignal size of the XP one will fix it?
[08:58] <DShepherd> pooyak, the elephant skin
[08:58] <pooyak> DShepherd, there's one that's like tree skin and that's nice
[08:58] <Phuzion> apt-get update should refresh the repositories, right?
[08:58] <ExRarne> I didn't make any backsups because my brother has by external hard drive :(
[08:58] <riotkittie> Boumboum6: changing it was the second thing i did. ;)
[08:59] <NorthByNorthWest> void^: thanks! Ill try that!
[08:59] <freezeman> Anyone have a working xorg.conf for ATI Radeon 9200?
[08:59] <Boumboum6> Ok I need to go...I too am dealing with getting a multi-boot system working....My original XP install got trashed during backup....re-installing it left Ubuntu intact but messed up other windows partitions...so I'm dealing with that now..
[08:59] <aeshyamae> dystopianray: one more q...i have a debian installed in my system..so by this time will that grub be gone?
[08:59] <freezeman> Anyone have a working xorg.conf for ATI Radeon 9200? If, please start a private chat please!
[09:00] <zethero1> modules anymore?
[09:00] <robbizzl1> help! my install hangs when loading (i think) cd-rom driver, any clue why?!?
[09:00] <Morgwyr> Ubuntu boots to a black screen after alt install; I can load PuppyLinux on it just fine. Anyone know of a fix?
[09:00] <riotkittie> aeshyamae: if it's stuck on getting files, grub hasnt been installed. you should be able to boot to debian with no probs.
[09:00] <DUUUUUDE> ok i think gparted formated my other HD, now i cant seem to find my formated HD anywhere? help?
[09:01] <Boumboum6> roitkittie: changing the partition back won't fix the problem if one or both of the partitions have been overwritten from the other partition....(the A install wrote in B's partition, the B install wrote to A's partition)...you have data damage if that's what happened. If my theory is right, you need to reinstall both OS's.  Wipe both partitions, install XP first, then install Ubuntu 2nd.
[09:01] <h1st0> Is there a way to re-generate the wine menu list?
[09:01] <robbizzl1> anyone?
[09:01] <aeshyamae> riotkittie: clicking the install again is not doing anything here:(
[09:01] <Phuzion> ok, just rebooted my hoary server, is there an easy way to bring this up to date?
[09:01] <Colro> My GTK theme makes several windows in Azureus completely unreadable -- is there a way to make it ignore themes and/or use its own?
[09:01] <riotkittie> aeshyamae: try logging out of the live user session and logging back in :|  you may need to reboot to have the install work  again though :|
=== euriber is now known as antisystem32
[09:01] <Boumboum6> if there's data on any of the partitions you want to preserve, make backups of both before wiping... then restore files from the backup (but not the whole OS--just the files you want to keep)
[09:02] <robbizzl1> just hang, blinking cursor ???? PLease HELP me!
[09:02] <aeshyamae> riotkittie: ok thanks ill look into it
[09:02] <critt> Anyone know what I can do to fix this?    I  upgraded to 7.10  from 7.4 . Now I have no sound playing avi files with any player.  I can play mp3 in xmms .
[09:02] <h1st0> Phuzion: up to date to hoary or do you want to upgrade to whats out now?
[09:02] <DShepherd> robbizzl1, where does it hang?
[09:02] <Phuzion> latest release
[09:02] <Morgwyr> Anyone know how to fix booting to a black screen with Ubuntu 7.10? I can boot PuppyLinux fine, so I think it's a graphics error
[09:02] <h1st0> Phuzion: you have to upgrade to each version youc an't just jump to current.
[09:03] <robbizzl1> when it says Uniform cd-rom driver
[09:03] <Phuzion> alright
[09:03] <h1st0> !upgrade > Phuzion
[09:03] <Boumboum6> wonder if there's a way to recover or erase passwords in Ubuntu?  If not, you can still boot from the liveCD and with root privileges, access every file on your install.
[09:03] <h1st0> Phuzion: read the message from ubotu
[09:03] <dystopianray> Phuzion: or do a fresh install of the latest
[09:03] <riotkittie> Morgwyr: what graphics card are you using?
[09:03] <DShepherd> Morgwyr, compiz running maybe?
[09:03] <h1st0> Boumboum6: sure there is just boot to livecd and reset users passwords etc...
[09:03] <Morgwyr> (riotkittie): a semi-new nvidia 8800 gts
[09:03] <dystopianray> Boumboum6: you cannot recover passwords but you can modify or erase them
[09:03] <Boumboum6> h1s0: cool :)  I'm still a semi-newbie. :)
[09:03] <robbizzl1> dshepherd it just hangs loading cd-rom driver....I am installing from the unpacked ISO in a folder
[09:03] <simplechat> ok this is wierd, ubuntu wouldn't find my internal ntfs disk, but the gusty installer did.
[09:04] <Morgwyr> DShepherd; would that happen even when i was installing? i had to alt install because it booted to the same black screen with the gui install.
[09:04] <simplechat> does this mean that gusty will find it next restart?
[09:04] <robbizzl1> should I place the files elswhere?
[09:04] <h1st0> simplechat: if it found it by itself it will.
[09:04] <Boumboum6> simplechat: I had the same problem. But they can be mounted manually if the fs is undamaged, and you can install a line in fstab to automount at boot time.
[09:04] <robbizzl1> Dshepherd: I don't even get to a GUI
[09:04] <_blitz_> I installed Beryl in Fesity and it is working without any problems.But When i restart my computer,beryl is not starting automatically.i have to start it manually.what should i do to make it run automatically on startup?
[09:04] <Morgwyr> robb, does it boot?
[09:04] <h1st0> !autostart > _blitz_
[09:05] <simplechat> Boumboum6: feisty called it damaged, for some reason
[09:05] <Ryuho> how do i enable onboard (the screen keyboard app) during login?
[09:05] <riotkittie> Morgwyr: was this a fresh install? or an upgrade? did you try ALT CTRL F1ing and doing a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorf?
[09:05] <robbizzl1> i go to grub, it starts what looks  like installing temporary drivers
[09:05] <robbizzl1> but hangs at the cd-rom installation
[09:05] <robbizzl1> and then just a blinking cursor
[09:05] <robbizzl1> ??
[09:05] <ramvi> Hi! I learned how to program in C++ at collage and would like to contribute. Ive read a lot on the ubuntu wiki, but I cant seem to find a "how to start" kind of thing. What application should I use to develop in C++ and what application should I use to make the GUI?
[09:05] <Morgwyr> (riotkittie): it's a fresh install. i've tried alt ctrl f1ing, but it's still just a black screen. it's almost like it's not displaying video.
[09:05] <h1st0> !enter > robbizzl1
[09:05] <robbizzl1> !enter
[09:05] <ubotu> Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[09:05] <Boumboum6> simplechat: it probably IS damaged. try fsck on it.....or from windows run chkdsk on it. damaged ntfs filesystems won't mount.
[09:05] <rickyfingers> kdevelop is pretty cool
[09:06] <simplechat> Boumboum6: gusty just mounted it perfectly. fsck works with ntfs?
[09:06] <Laser87>  I have a prob with Firefox3.0a8 on Linux - see: http://capriv8.de/sonst/Bildschirmfoto-8.png
[09:06] <robbizzl1> k im an idiot, what does !enter mean
[09:06] <ramvi> rickyfingers: thought kdevelop was for for kde development. based on qt
[09:06] <Laser87> The first line with files, edit... only shows up when moving mouse over, same 2nd line with back, forward...
[09:06] <h1st0> Laser87: you are using an alpha version of firefox?
[09:06] <riotkittie> Morgwyr: i know i've seen other people mention the same thing here but i'm not sure how they resolved it :( maybe there's something on the forums...
[09:06] <Laser87> tabs never show up
[09:06] <DShepherd> ramvi, anjuta i hear is good
[09:06] <Boumboum6> simplechat: not sure...but I DO know there is a program for Ubuntu that will check ntfs filesystems. My GPartEd LiveCD does it automatically.
[09:07] <zethero1> how do you load a module in the terminal?
[09:07] <Laser87> h1st0: yes and the fx2
[09:07] <lobo_nz> I am getting an error booting 2.6.22-14 kernel after gutsy upgrade, seems my HD fails to mount with "Device or resource is busy" I can boot the earlier 2.6.20-16 kernel any Ideas how to fix it or whats going wrong
[09:07] <rickyfingers> ramvi: just an easy way to get your feet wet programming gui's in linux
[09:07] <riotkittie> zethero1: modprobe <module>
[09:07] <h1st0> Laser87: does the same thing happen in fx2?
[09:07] <DShepherd> ramvi, glade i hear is good for GUI development
[09:07] <Laser87> And most websites sghow up partly with mouse over
[09:07] <neur1> hello what if it says it's gonna be 2 days to fetch upgrades, at 19 0f 1167 right now can I continue if I turn the pc off?
[09:07] <zethero1> riotkittie: ok... and how do you unload the same module?
[09:07] <Laser87> h1st0: no, and it didn't happen in Alpha7...
[09:07] <simplechat> neur1: is this apt?
[09:07] <Boumboum6> neur1: yes. it'll just resume when you boot up again.
[09:07] <critt> Anyone know what I can do to fix sound playing avi files?
[09:07] <nickrud> neur1: yes, apt supports resuming downloads for the upgrade
[09:07] <simplechat> neur1: it should be downloading to your cache
[09:08] <Morgwyr> riotkittie; the solution on the forums seems to be recongifuring the xserver, which i can't do .
[09:08] <simplechat> neur1: so it should pick back up on the downloading once your done
[09:08] <hislop> does anyone knowa how to play encrypt wmv file with ubuntu?
[09:08] <Boumboum6> critt: I do not. :(
[09:08] <robbizzl1> so any thoughts on this hang while loading cd-rom driver even before GUI?
[09:08] <h1st0> Laser87: well then you need to talk to the firefox devs.  If you are using alpha software and expecting to get support you are a little out of yoru mind.
[09:08] <neur1> thank you whew#!
[09:08] <critt> Boumboum6 ty anyway
[09:08] <ompaul> neur1, you can and more important you should go into synaptic and have it download only
[09:08] <h1st0> hislop: what version of ubuntu.
[09:08] <DShepherd> critt, have you install the appropriate restricted drivers already?
[09:08] <ompaul> neur1, when you are finished your download try again - in case of updates
[09:09] <Laser87> h1st0: I just want to know, if others have the same prob or if it is just my PC :-)
[09:09] <atrain> Having horrible trouble with gutsy: livecd wont load X, cant get X working with update, 845 based laptop Dell Inspiron 1100. Tried vesa, i810, and intel xorg drivers. Works fine, but only when launched as root with xstart. Even with kdm, x just goes blank and restarts. What should I try next?
[09:09] <hislop> hlst0,gutsy
[09:09] <ompaul> neur1, then you can "apply" the downloaded packages
[09:09] <Boumboum6> neur1: :)  I went though that myself a number of times--I do not have 24/7 internet..I get online at wifi hotspots at the library...and have to interrupt downloads when the library closes. :)
[09:09] <h1st0> Laser87: ask the firefox devs.
[09:09] <void^> Laser87: i've seen it happen, nothing to be surprised about really with dev snapshots..
=== Xiangning_Liu is now known as inami
[09:09] <nickrud> Boumboum6: I bet you know all the best places ;)
[09:09] <h1st0> hislop: just double click on a wmv and it will play if you don't have codecs it will prompt you.
[09:09] <Boumboum6> neur1: and you won't have to restart from the beginning either. any files that completed download will be perserved.
[09:10] <critt> DShepherd not sure wich drivers those might be . So I guess not?:P
[09:10] <callocx> I have weird problem. My notification area applet is not showing any icons for about 3-4 minutes after logging in. Also, I cannot log out during that time, and my wireless is not starting. :S
[09:10] <callocx> It all worked fine in 7.04
[09:10] <Boumboum6> nickrud: heh. the best ones for ME, yes...maybe not so good for others. :)
[09:10] <DShepherd> critt, running ubuntu?
[09:10] <riotkittie>  i wonder if the library turns their wifi off when they close. i should check that out sometime :x
[09:10] <Laser87> Just didn't find it on bugzilla - then I will write a bugreport
[09:10] <DUUUUUDE> hi, i need help
[09:10] <hislop> hlst0,it promtped cant play because it was encrypted
[09:10] <tokyoahead> guys what do I have to uninstall if I want to remove the 2.6.20 kernel?
[09:10] <h1st0> hislop: ahh that I have no idea about perhaps goodle.
[09:10] <DUUUUUDE> how should i format my hard drive? i am using gparted.
[09:10] <critt> DShepherd yes upgraded to 7.10 today now now sound playing AVI
[09:10] <Boumboum6> riot: some do, some don't. I use 2 libraries..one does, 30 minutes after closing, the other one works 24/7... heh
[09:11] <DShepherd> critt, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[09:11] <riotkittie> DUUUUUDE: you should be able to right click and select format
[09:11] <DUUUUUDE> says unallocated
[09:11] <DShepherd> critt, oh.. you upgraded.. hmm.. that could be a different problem all together. sometimes upgrades can mess things up. or users can mess up upgrades :-)
[09:11] <Boumboum6> Duuude: right-click on a partition, a pop-up menu should show up...one of the items should be "format as"...pick a filesystem to format...
[09:11] <critt> COol hope this works. You guys are to fast ..
[09:12] <riotkittie> in that case, put a file system on it, DUUUUUDE. and you're good to go.
[09:12] <DUUUUUDE> i dont have that option rio
[09:12] <DUUUUUDE> says New
[09:12] <Boumboum6> Yeah. that means it hasn't been made into a partition yet...so Create Partition first...then format second.
[09:12] <JW_704> Hello
[09:12] <JW_704> I do have sound in 710? This is a new install
[09:12] <riotkittie> you cant create a new partition, DUUUUUDE ?
[09:12] <DUUUUUDE> says New and Information, those r the options i get
[09:12] <riotkittie> ok. go for New. create a partition.
[09:12] <Boumboum6> Sound works for me, too.
[09:12] <ninnemana> anyone know why i get "AttributeError: 'compizconfig.Plugin' object has no attribute 'Initialized'" when running ccsm from command line?
[09:12] <critt> hmm don't know what I could have done.But guess I could a screwed something up
[09:12] <murlidhar> hmm is there any game that can replace Counter Strike for linux???
[09:12] <DUUUUUDE> yes i can create new partition
[09:13] <Boumboum6> Duude: do so. GPartEd won't format unpartitioned spaces.
[09:13] <gezim> Guys, I shot myself in the foot. I disabled my restricted drivers for my graphics card and a bunch of stuff got uninstalled. How do I undo that?
[09:13] <DShepherd> critt, yeah i do that from time to time.
[09:13] <dystopianray> murlidhar: why not just play counter strike?
=== DarkHack is now known as D[a]rkH[a]ck
[09:13] <DUUUUUDE> the default settings didn't seem to work
[09:13] <gezim> BTW, I can't get X running now.
[09:13] <murlidhar> dystopianray: i don't want to use wine
[09:13] <DUUUUUDE> after format
[09:13] <Boumboum6> gezim: should be able to just click "enable" and it should all re-install from the net again.
[09:13] <dystopianray> murlidhar: why?
[09:13] <DShepherd> critt, run apt-get -f install to ensure nothing was broken
[09:14] <DUUUUUDE> i can read, but not write?
[09:14] <todkon> hmm, my resolution in GDM is 1280x800 for some reason, but when I login, xfce loads my 1280x1024 resolution... how would I go about fixing this>
[09:14] <todkon> ?
[09:14] <gezim> Boumboum6: I can't because I can't get to X...so gnome doesn't work.
[09:14] <critt> DShepherd  d/l extras now
[09:14] <murlidhar> dystopianray: i dunno but i hate wine
[09:14] <hislop> does anyone knows how to play encrypted wmv file with ubuntu?
[09:14] <simplechat> gezim: what?
[09:14] <gezim> Boumboum6: is there a way to "click" by command line
[09:14] <dystopianray> murlidhar: it will let you play counter strike
[09:14] <DShepherd> critt, ok kool. stuff installing?
[09:14] <DUUUUUDE> should it be primary partition? etc?
[09:14] <todkon> my xorg.conf doesn't specify any 1280x1024
[09:14] <sonium> I get a segfault. Is there a way to analyze the error a bit more to give the develper some feedback?
[09:14] <simplechat> gezim: click command line?
[09:14] <todkon>  I mean, 1280x800
[09:14] <critt> yes
[09:15] <gezim> simplechat: lost X because I disabled my restricted driver. how do I get it back?
[09:15] <DShepherd> critt, that can be very good. hope that helps
[09:15] <gezim> is there a way to check history of apt-getting ?
[09:15] <DUUUUUDE> should it be extanted partition?
[09:15] <DUUUUUDE> etc?
[09:15] <JW_704> I need to get my sound working in Ubuntu 7.10 I have a soundblaster
[09:15] <DUUUUUDE> help
[09:15] <murlidhar> dystopianray: i know i just don't like the interface of wine  and all that stuff. Maybe i have to wait until any game similar to Counter Strike comes to Linux
[09:15] <murlidhar> :(
[09:15] <zesgames78> boas
[09:15] <riotkittie> gezim: click by command line? err.  like... use your mouse in a TTY? or something else?
[09:16] <gezim> riotkittie: no, no.
[09:16] <dystopianray> murlidhar: what interface? it's just 'wine install.exe' and your program installs, then you run it from the applications menu
[09:16] <gezim> riotkittie: just to undo what I've done.
[09:16] <riotkittie> DUUUUUDE: what are you doing with this drive?
[09:16] <DUUUUUDE> just for backup and saving files
[09:16] <dystopianray> murlidhar: I think you can just click 'install.exe' these days and it'll automatically run it through wine
[09:16] <DUUUUUDE> thats all
[09:16] <riotkittie> gezim: you cant hit Ctrl^C to stop most things, most of the time
[09:17] <JW_704> Anyone? Need sound to work in Ubuntu 7.10
[09:17] <riotkittie> DUUUUUDE: ok, well extended or primary doesnt really matter in that case.
[09:17] <todkon> JW_704: dude, It took me hella long to figure it out, but its simples as fuck
[09:17] <MaTrIx-X> Whats the correct syntax for mounting an NTFS drive on startup in fstab? (7.10)
[09:17] <murlidhar> dystopianray: ain't there any other game ported to linux . don't wanna play ET cuz it is not team based i guess.
[09:17] <DUUUUUDE> JW, we need more ppl like u, too bad my sound works :)
[09:17] <critt> me too.  Have to get use to this setup. Can't type shift key to capitalize the d . every time I try my desktop spins around..Guess it bind key.:-D

[09:17] <dystopianray> murlidhar: just use wine and counter strike
[09:17] <DShepherd> gezim, you can check out /var/log/dpkg.log. that might help
[09:17] <DUUUUUDE> should it be ext2?
[09:18] <Jban> Ok, I need help with my USB Sound for Ubuntu7.10  / No matter how many things I try, I literally cannot get all of my Sound Out to come through my Logtitech USB Headset (which works fine with Skype / Pidgin) when either watching DVD or something on You Tube.  Can anyone help me out?

[09:21] <riotkittie> MaTrIx-X: yes. why are you trying to mount to etc?
[09:21] <dystopianray> MaTrIx-X: and it's not using umask
[09:21] <Amun> dystopianray: so do it without internet... and it should work out perfect?
[09:21] <MaTrIx-X> I wasn't sure where I was supposed to mount, so I picked /etc
[09:21] <dystopianray> Amun: it did for me

[09:21] <critt> DShepherd still no sound . Will work on it tomorow thanks for the help though may need a reboot anyways..
[09:21] <Symmetria> how do I search the archives for a specific package I wanna install (Im looking for sigc++)
[09:21] <dfgas> h1st0, exactly
[09:21] <dystopianray> Amun: or just start installing it, if it gets stuck at 82% disconnect your ethernet and it'll finish
[09:21] <DShepherd> MaTrIx-X, /dev/sda? that's the whole disk? i think you should mounting a partition
[09:21] <magnetron> dfgas: i told you i don't know the answer to your question
[09:21] <Amun> dystopianray: alright. thanks alot.
[09:21] <DUUUUUDE> ok how i change permission :) chmod...etc? how?
[09:21] <mic> Amun: do you talk about ppc installation?
[09:21] <dfgas> k
[09:21] <nickrud> Symmetria: apt-cache search
[09:22] <JW_704> todkon, I did what you said, still no sound :/
[09:22] <Amun> mic: no. x86
[09:22] <MaTrIx-X> DShepherd: should it be /dev/sda1 then? There's only one partition on the drive.
[09:22] <Matic`Makovec> How can I check the partitions UUID
[09:22] <DShepherd> MaTrIx-X, yeah i think so
[09:22] <simplechat> uh
[09:22] <murlidhar> DUUUUUDE: if u r not able to write in ntfs partitions then u have to install ntfs-3g and ntfs-config
[09:22] <nickrud> Symmetria: for what package might have the headers you want, try searching on packages.ubuntu.com
[09:22] <simplechat> does gusty always take a long time scanning the mirror?
[09:22] <mic> Amun: can you please give the error message you get?
[09:22] <simplechat> its been stuck on 82% for a very long time
[09:22] <DShepherd> simplechat, the mirrors might be slow
[09:22] <DUUUUUDE> i dont think its ntfs
[09:23] <DShepherd> !mirrors
[09:23] <ubotu> Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive - PLEASE use the !torrents to download Gutsy, and help keeping the servers' load low!
[09:23] <MaTrIx-X> dystopianray: is what location is preferable over /etc ?
[09:23] <DUUUUUDE> its ext3
[09:23] <simplechat> DShepherd: because of all the installs? your saying just let it sit there for awhile?
[09:23] <DUUUUUDE> or something
[09:23] <Amun> mic: none yet. haven't tried installing. on the previous release (or maybe it was a alpha/beta of gutsy) it froze into it with no error messages. just didnt want the same outcome, since it messed my MBR up. took me a few to fix it.
[09:23] <mic> Amun: ok thanks
[09:23] <hinogi> "firefox-bin" is eating up a whole lot of processor power and behing extremely slow to react any suggestions how to fix that?
[09:23] <simplechat> DShepherd: these arn't the install cd mirrors, this is the apt mirrors (i think)
[09:23]  * nickrud waits for recover from shock
[09:23] <simplechat> it says "configuring apt", 82%, scanning the mirror
[09:23] <dystopianray> MaTrIx-X: /media

[09:23] <Amun> if the install works, ill be back thanking you guys. if i dont return... something broke.. Seeya!

[09:24] <DShepherd> simplechat, well, leaving it there for a while might solve your problem. how long has it been doing that?
[09:24] <mic> DShepherd: problem is that not everything is mirrored on other servers :(
[09:24] <murlidhar> DUUUUUDE: then check probly u do not have write permissions to that partition

[09:25] <atrain> Wierd issue, finaly resolved. Feisty -> Gutsy on laptop had many wierd issues, finally got all packages switched over, then X couldn't start. After lots of debuging, found that /tmp was chmod 755!! What would have caused that (could it be chrooting into the system with the livecd?)
[09:25] <LastLemming> oups wrong chat
[09:25] <bananamuzzj> this happend after i installed the drivers on the ATi website
[09:25] <bananamuzzj> can someone helpm e?

[09:25] <simplechat> dystopianray:  ah, its done now :) damn that was slow :)
[09:25] <DUUUUUDE> so how do i change the permission? i cant write to my added HD.
[09:25] <simplechat> dystopianray: ok, thanks anyway :)(
[09:25] <dystopianray> simplechat: it managed to finish?
[09:25] <simplechat> DUUUUUDE: check mount, see if its mounted ro
[09:26] <riotkittie> DUUUUUDE: edit fstab -- add the drive there
[09:26] <mic> DUUUUUDE: chmod 755 /device
[09:26] <simplechat> dystopianray: yep, now its configuring hardware
[09:26] <bananamuzzj> :(
[09:26] <bananamuzzj> none can help me? :(
[09:26] <nickrud> simplechat: it might be that it was checking various mirror speeds, and since they're all slow ...
[09:26] <simplechat> mic: its probably mounted ro, if not, then you need to be sudo.
[09:26] <robotphood> when I look at /proc/cpuinfo only 1 cpu shows when I have a dual core, does this mean ubuntu doesn't see my 2nd cpu?

[09:27] <DShepherd> darkzero, its been mixed for me. but so far.. its getting better and better. waiting for the gnome updates to come thru

[09:28] <bananamuzzj> It worked fine after i installed ubuntu and selected the driver from the menu

[09:29] <bananamuzzj> but i installed the one on the ATi website
[09:29] <bananamuzzj> after that fglrx don works
[09:29] <bananamuzzj> it gives me graphical save mode

[09:29] <ompaul> bananamuzzj, and now you got a message from the bot telling you how to do stuff -- go read it
[09:29] <robotphood> any ideas dystopianray ?
[09:29] <bananamuzzj> Yea, i'm going to try that <3
[09:29] <crshman> actually i think it has to do with the mirrors being hammered....because it seems to be downloading the kernel
[09:29] <darkzero> < I have ati x600 and got it working fine
[09:29] <riotkittie> will resizing partitions cause problems with their UUIDs or no?
[09:29] <atrain> lolz, I used altcd + torrent... Nice and quick, then the real fun began when it crashed halfway through and didn't clean up the mess. Then Xorg doesnt load on the livecd, then I found nothing worked cause /tmp was exclusive to root
[09:30] <MAXDDARK> I have installed my ATI9800Pro drivers using restricted manager, it seems to work fine, but is it the same as installing it manually from the amd drivers ?

[09:45] <dystopianray> heartsblood: top
[09:45] <Andycasss> Is there a event viewer or something similar in ubuntu?
[09:45] <Matic`Makovec> Hello there. My friend here has a problem with compiz-fusion. He enabled it but it doesn't actually run and when he tries to run it he gets this: http://pastebin.rebro.org/pastebin.php?show=10
[09:45] <robotphood> dystopianray, okay thanks anyway
[09:45] <chronographer> Minnozz: google for a /etc/network/interfaces howto
[09:45] <dystopianray> Andycasss: what events?
[09:45] <chronographer> theres a lot of options i think
[09:46] <Andycasss> Im trying to figure out if my script is launched when i boot
[09:46] <heartsblood> dystioianray: it doesn't display memory mapping very well
[09:46] <dystopianray> Matic`Makovec: what video card does he have?
[09:46] <Alexy> how do i set up a L2TP connection, using a modem connected via network connection?
[09:46] <ompaul> heartsblood, hehehe you don't want too much check out sysinfo but you really want ps auwx and atop or top
[09:46] <heartsblood> dystioianray: well, not visually anyway.
[09:46] <Matic`Makovec> 7600GT - nvidia
[09:46] <pk> ompaul:  i was trying to configure sambe to network from vista to ubuntu
[09:46] <Minnozz> chronographer: Well it works, but maybe I have to disable some other programs? I'll paste the file in a moment
[09:46] <euriber> ubuntu-es
[09:46] <Matic`Makovec> And he has stuff like nvidia-glx-new installed because it installs it automatically when you enable it if I'm not mistaken, dystopianray
=== euriber is now known as antisystem32
[09:46] <gustavo_> ompaul it boots, do not freeze, just has a long delay
[09:47] <dystopianray> Matic`Makovec: so he has an nvidia card?
[09:47] <heartsblood> ompaul, i'll check them out ty.
[09:47] <chronographer> I think interfaces takes priority... if you cahnge stuff there it will be whats used...  So you can check it using 'ifconfig'
[09:47] <Matic`Makovec> Yes, Nvidia GeForce 7600GT, dystopianray
[09:47] <ompaul> pk, you are confusing as anything, please write out your problem with some detail in a pastebin and give the URL to the channel not to me
[09:47] <ompaul> gustavo_, this is normal, more so if the machine is of a low spec
[09:48] <Alexy> Heya, how do i set up a L2TP connection, using a modem connected via network connection?
[09:48] <gustavo_> ompaul but it shows messages that states: freeze and timeout... so its not normal
[09:48] <pk> ompaul: the last thing i did was to try to configure samba to work with vista and when i rebooted i got the gdm error
[09:48] <ompaul> gustavo_, so then my first item applies read it and use it
[09:48] <Andycasss> Does samba work with vista?
[09:49] <void^> Matic`Makovec: the paste doesn't indicate a problem.
[09:49] <Minnozz> chronographer: http://paster.dazjorz.com/?p=1203 & http://paster.dazjorz.com/?p=1204 & http://paster.dazjorz.com/?p=1205
[09:49] <ompaul> pk, well (A) I know very little of samba and (B) samba has nothing to do with GDM as far as I know
[09:49] <Matic`Makovec> void^, what should I ask him to paste?
[09:49] <ompaul> pk, just summing up the last 14 years of running X for you there ;-)
[09:49] <pk> ompaul: thats what i thught
[09:49] <gustavo_> ompaul " There are at least major two cases where one may wish to use boot options. Case 1: When trying to install, and the install freezes. Case 2: After a system has been installed and does not boot or the system needs adjustment. " i didnt see anything that might help :(
[09:50] <ompaul> gustavo_, block apic and apci
[09:50] <void^> Matic`Makovec: what does the problem look like, and is he running compiz as root?
[09:50] <gustavo_> ompaul ok, will try
[09:50] <ompaul> gustavo_, the idea is that you stop the machine from running the code that does you bad
[09:50] <pk> ompaul:  its tells me something about user does noy exist
[09:50] <ompaul> pk, you have well broken that machine
[09:51] <Alexy> ompaul, can you help me setting a connetion?
[09:51] <ompaul> Alexy, ask the channel
=== Mez|Away is now known as Mez
[09:51] <Alexy> i did, twice
[09:51] <Minnozz> chronographer: you found anything that's wrong in those pastes?
[09:51] <Matic`Makovec> void^, well he says it looks like the way he pasted on pastebin... I can't really tell you more
[09:51] <chronographer> So do you have any problems???  The only thing I think is wrong is your netmask, which should be 255.0.0.0 (for ip of 10.0.0.*)  I believe. Also i thikn you need only one entry for wlan0 right?
[09:52] <ompaul> Alexy, you see you asked the channel:  how do i set up a L2TP connection, using a modem connected via network connection and I have no idea with L2TP is
[09:52] <void^> Matic`Makovec: that's just the way it looks when it works fine, except for the root part.
[09:52] <chronographer> what is sixxs ??
[09:52] <Minnozz> chronographer: it's an ipv6 tunnel broker
[09:53] <ompaul> Alexy, and I would use OpenVPN for a tunnel
[09:53] <Alexy> ompaul, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs).
[09:53] <Minnozz> chronographer: that's why there are 2 entries for wlan0, but I'm not 100% sure this is the right way
[09:53] <simplechat> back
[09:53] <Matic`Makovec> Yeah void^, he said that he tried to run it as normal user now and it didn't give him previous errors (I wonder what the hell was he thinking running it as root)
[09:53] <Minnozz> chronographer: but on the other hand, ipv6 works fine (I'm connected with it now) so I don't think that's the problem
[09:54] <dystopianray> why am I getting errors about not being able to load the nvidia kernel module?
[09:54] <simplechat> hey everybody, how do i get rid of the random conflicts with gusty?
[09:54] <Alexy> ompaul, I have no knowledge regarding anything concerning protocols, I have just installed ubuntu today, so can you please explain?
[09:54] <chronographer> so whats the problem?
[09:54] <ompaul> Alexy, I would use a program called OpenVPN to create a tunnel
[09:54] <simplechat> chronographer: for random applications that i'm trying to install, apt just plain doesn't want to instlal them, citing conflicts.
[09:55] <Minnozz> chronographer: After some while my connection fails, and I get loads of these errors in /var/log/syslog : http://paster.dazjorz.com/?a=rawpaste&p=1202
[09:55] <simplechat> chronographer: its very, very, very wierd

[10:00] <Minnozz> chronographer: well that could be the problem, the only thing I did was telling it nog to start up again (it asked for it when I quit knetworkmanager)
[10:00] <Matic`Makovec> Is there a place where the new "tricks" with compiz and similar stuff is described? (like super + e, alt+scrool and stuff..)
[10:00] <smmagic> That isn't very good..

[10:00] <dystopianray> I cannot get the nvidia drivers working after installing nvidia-glx-new

[10:01] <ptrack88> Currently using Gutsy CDs
[10:01] <ptrack88> (burned)
[10:01] <ompaul> smmagic, it is - you are messing with kernel level configuration and thus require a password you don't want any user on a  potentially multi user system messing with the FW
[10:01] <smmagic> Argh..
[10:01] <ptrack88> it booted early
[10:01] <smmagic> Maybe I should get a different firewall
[10:01] <Andycasss> Does samba work with vista?
[10:01] <ompaul> smmagic, what servers are you running?
[10:01] <smmagic> What do you mean by servers
[10:02] <simplechat> Andycasss: teag
[10:02] <simplechat> *yeah
[10:02] <ompaul> smmagic, remember the windows default is insecure kind of a lot different to ubuntu you don't need to turn on a firewall
[10:02] <ptrack88> can someone assist me?
[10:02] <smmagic> So I don't need a firewall?
[10:02] <ompaul> smmagic, if you have to ask most likely you don't need to do what you are doing
[10:02] <ptrack88> I my system will not boot into Ubuntu after reboot following install
[10:02] <ptrack88> it hangs with no errors
[10:03] <ptrack88> just a black screen and a flashing underscore symbol

[10:06] <simplechat> TuxForce: you there? i think i've got some idea what the problem is
[10:06] <dor0> hello guys, any way to set grub with "splash" for 1680x1050 resolutin?
[10:06] <dystopianray> DanMulvey: sudo update-alternatives --config java
[10:06] <simplechat> dor0: possibly, why that specific resolution?
[10:06] <dystopianray> DanMulvey: then edit /etc/eclipse/java_home and comment out the first two lines
[10:06] <Yodude> hello, does anybody know why the rotate cube plugin in compiz fusion lags so much ? sometimes i grab it with the mouse and it runs well but sometimes it lags a lot making the effect repulsive !
[10:06] <Yodude> =-O
[10:06] <DanMulvey> alright cool, thanks a lot
[10:07] <dystopianray> DanMulvey: and you might need to delete your eclipse config to get it to pick up the new jvm
[10:07] <dor0> is my monitor resolution, other resolutions dont works, and i am forced to use "nosplash" atm
[10:07] <DanMulvey> oh alright

[10:07] <rontana> Has anyone had any issues with usb logitech trackballs not being detected by gutsy on boot? if i unplug it and reconnect once its booted it works fine
[10:07] <ompaul> DanMulvey, or try sudo dpkg-reconfigure elipse
[10:07] <dystopianray> DanMulvey: but I would suggest learning how to do java without eclipse first
[10:07] <chronographer>  what is the .Xauthority and .Xauthority-c and -l files???

[10:09] <DanMulvey> oh ok

[10:12] <Yodude> hello, does anybody know why the rotate cube plugin in compiz fusion lags so much ? sometimes i grab it with the mouse and it runs well but sometimes it lags a lot making the effect repulsive ! I think it might be a bug seeing that different ways of grabbing the cube produce different levels of performance

[10:12] <snipa_spi> awe
[10:12]  * lobo_nz fixed his boot issue it appears to be a bug with evms which was not automatically uninstalled with the gutsy upgrade
[10:13] <snipa_spi> moje li da pitam ne6to
[10:13] <snipa_spi> help me
[10:13] <AmirB_> so I just installed Gutsy Gibbons last night, expecting it to be wonderful. Which it was...except for the wireless networking!!!
[10:13] <dystopianray> AmirB_: what wireless card do you have?
[10:13] <AmirB_> I don't understand it! My wireless card worked perfectly in Fiesty fawn, but I upgrade and it stops working

[10:13] <AmirB_> it's a D-Link with an Atheros chipset
[10:14] <AmirB_> can't remember the exact model, but I can look it up

[10:15] <dor0> Yodude: what video card do you have?
[10:15] <Andycasss> Is there a way to automount samba when the host is offline at the boot, but comes online afterwards?
[10:16] <Yodude> dor0: nvidia geforeFX 5200 with 256 bundled video memory
[10:16] <AmirB_> basically it see's all the networks and tries connecting. after doing the circling animation for a while...it kinda gets stuck. the circle stops in the middle and if I hover over it it says "attempting to connect with XXX"
[10:16] <xtc1> hi, i can't view video @ ubuntu 7.10 (I have vlc player) -only the sound plays. I searched for codecs but i think its a general problem
[10:17] <cavediver> Hi there. I read that you can finally encrypt / on the alternate install CD. Anyone knows what is used and what cipher and key-length is used?
[10:17] <Moduliz0r> How do I delete the last SWAP partition in Gparted?
[10:17] <AmirB_> if I try to disable networking or wireless, nothing happens and if I try to open the network manager, it hangs

=== marko-_-_ is now known as marko-_-
[10:17] <Yodude> dor0: do you think it migt be a bug ?
[10:17] <dor0> xtc1: VLC comes with all codecs, you dont need anything else special, if u installed all package and deps
[10:17] <ompaul> Andycasss, beyond the scope of this channel, very quickly, ping box (as long as it replies) trigger via a daemon the mounting - but more important is the how do you remove it if someone wants to shut it down - again beyond here
[10:17] <AmirB_> so, dystopianray? you got anything about that?
[10:17] <Amun[Laptop]> i'm dual booting xp and ubuntu. my 2nd partition is ubuntu, and i got a 500mb swap partition. should my ubuntu partition be primary or logical, and what should my swap partition be?

[10:18] <DanMulvey> anyone do the online ubuntu courses?
[10:19] <zparta> is it safe to swap the gfx?
[10:19] <HackXP> DanMulvey: What kind of courses?
[10:19] <Moduliz0r> Gparted crashes after operations when it says "Scanning partitions"
[10:19] <zparta> i got a 7600GT now and on monday il have a 8800GTS
[10:19] <Moduliz0r> scanning all devices*

[10:23] <Ptrack88> I am in need of assistance
[10:23] <tehknow> I have it now
[10:23] <tehknow> its ok
[10:24] <Ptrack88> I believe that the Windows Vista install in my MBR is messing up my system from booting into Ubuntu
[10:24] <Ptrack88> I had it running earlier but I did not have a driver for network card
[10:24] <Ptrack88> I put in a different card and I can make it through the install
[10:24] <Ptrack88> but it does not boot afterwards
[10:24] <Ptrack88> it used to... like three installs back
[10:24] <Ptrack88> should I clear drive and try again?
[10:25] <Ptrack88> any suggestions?
[10:25] <tehknow> Ptrack88, did you install vista over ubuntu?
[10:25] <Ptrack88> no this drive was pulled from a RAID 5 configuration
[10:25] <Ptrack88> it still see Vista in the grub loader option during install
[10:26]  * tehknow isn't familiar with RAID
[10:26] <Ptrack88> I tried deleting all the partitions
[10:26] <BoomSie> anybody over here with ALSA mixer problems? Mixer doesn't have influence on the volume, and can only control the volume through the PCM?
[10:26] <Ptrack88> is there a way to do a reformat from the live cd?
[10:26] <Andycasss> Is there a way to specify a shorter timeout on fstab
[10:26] <tehknow> Ptrack88, a reformat of what
[10:26] <tehknow> the vista drive?
[10:26] <Ptrack88> the entire drive
[10:27] <Andycasss> If the host is offlne
[10:27] <Ptrack88> like a low level delete
[10:27] <tehknow> Ptrack88, look for gparted
[10:27] <Ptrack88> i am in it
[10:27] <tehknow> its a live cd for partitioning
[10:27] <Ptrack88> I am in gparted
[10:27] <tehknow> ok
[10:27] <Ptrack88> running ubuntu live cd
[10:27] <sparsec> I have weird problems with Gutsy - keyring hasn't been set up, yet nm-applet accesses it with no problems, without password. Since the password hasn't been set up, I can't even change the master password. Anyone experiencing this too?
[10:27] <tehknow> Ptrack88, then try formatting the drive
[10:27] <Ptrack88> lets start over
[10:28] <DaBeowulf> Hello, where is that hardlink/symlink mess with Feisty -> Gutsy updates documented a little, just got the recommended update to tzdata and didn't click the link in the update description..
[10:28] <Mr> hello I turned off my Computer yesterday, woke up this morning and now when I boot I get this error:
[10:28] <Mr> Kernel Panic   not syncing VFS   Unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0)
[10:28] <Mr> can anyone help me?
[10:28] <lobo_nz> I have no window decorations when I activate Extra visual effects, I loaded the compiz config  and the decorations are ticked on any ideas how to get them working?
[10:28] <Mr> lobo_nz: #compiz-fusion
[10:28] <tehknow> lobo_nz, is compiz running?
[10:29] <tehknow> press alt + f2
[10:29] <Nzzz> anyone have an HP laptop with ubuntu? does it work well?
[10:29] <tehknow> then type
[10:29] <tehknow> compiz --replace
[10:29] <Ptrack88> I install Ubuntu (booted fine a few installs back but there is issues with the intel 85266 int. nic card so I installed a new one) and I installed Ubuntu Server (7.10 d/led and burned to cd) and then when I go to reboot, it hangs on a black screen
[10:29] <Gun_Smoke> Anyone have lm-sensors running?
[10:29] <Andycasss> Is there a way to specify a shorter timeout on fstab
[10:29] <Ptrack88> same thing with Ubuntu Desktop, installs fine... reboots and hangs
[10:29] <phishie> remember alt-f7 to get back here though =D
[10:29] <tehknow> Ptrack88, does it boot at all?
[10:29] <volk> Ptrack88, try disabling splash in your /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:29] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: yes
[10:30] <Ptrack88> it does not boot at all
[10:30] <tehknow> Ptrack88, remove any usb devices
[10:30] <Kevin_Wolf> I can't seem to get any display output from X on my X1600 Pro 512MB PCIe... any ideas?  Same case with livecd and alt install... using 7.10 AMD64
[10:30] <Mr> when I boot I get this error:
[10:30] <Mr> Kernel Panic not syncing VFS Unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0)
[10:30] <Mr> Any help would be great!
[10:30] <Ptrack88> not even to grub loader
[10:30] <volk> hmm ok
[10:30] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: Any tricks you could pass my way?
[10:30] <tehknow> Ptrack88, restart and then select the '
[10:30] <lobo_nz> tehknow, ok that got my borders back but now the effects are gone, its defaulted back to none
[10:30] <tehknow> select boot option'
[10:30] <Minnozz> anybody knows how to fix these errors? I get them when my network fails (they're in /var/log/syslog) and it's impossible to get my network to work again without rebooting. http://paster.dazjorz.com/?a=rawpaste&p=1202
[10:31] <tehknow> lobo_nz, I don't know then
[10:31] <Ptrack88> okay
[10:31] <tehknow> try the compiz fusion channel
[10:31] <Ptrack88> boot option
[10:31] <tehknow> Ptrack88, yeah
[10:31] <lobo_nz> tehknow, thx
[10:31] <tehknow> now select the hard drive
[10:31] <bwoaas> Hi all, I am sorry to add another question. I installed Gutsy, an now my major problem is that my Pentium M runs at 600MHz, frequency scaling does not seem to work. Has anyone else got frequency scaling problems?
[10:31] <Ptrack88> what format would i put that in
[10:31] <jscinoz> hey everyone, i can no longer use ssh to connect to any server, when i try it says "SSH: hostnamehere: Name or Service not known" it says this for any server, and if i try connect via ip the same thing happens, how can i fix this?
[10:31] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: are the sensors detected?
[10:31] <tehknow> Ptrack88, ???
[10:31] <tehknow> you are selecting the boot device
[10:31] <Ptrack88> also, during install... the drives are labeled scsi3 and scsi4
[10:31] <Grant101> Hi all newbie here having sound problems
[10:32] <Ptrack88> oh it'll give me options
[10:32] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: Not so far...
[10:32] <tehknow> Ptrack88, yeah
[10:32] <Ptrack88> or do i type it in like /hda1
[10:32] <tehknow> no
[10:32] <Ptrack88> gotcha
[10:32] <tehknow> it should give you options like cd drive
[10:32] <tehknow> hdd
[10:32] <tehknow> flash drive
[10:32] <tehknow> network
[10:32] <tehknow> stuff like that
[10:32] <tehknow> select the hard drive
[10:32] <tehknow> I'll brb
[10:32] <Ptrack88> oh you are talking the bios boot options
[10:32] <Ptrack88> I did that
[10:32] <Ptrack88> same thing
[10:32] <tehknow> hmm
[10:32] <Ptrack88> it says booting from hard drive
[10:32] <seraph> hi, i don't want some partitions (recovery partitions) to be shown in the file manager, is there a way to hide them?
[10:32] <tehknow> are there any USB devices plug'd in
[10:33] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: get sensors-detect and run it with sudo
[10:33] <tehknow> that has a tendency to stop mine booting
[10:33] <Ptrack88> and then its a black screen with a flashing cursor
[10:33] <Mr> Error while booting: Kernel Panic not syncing VFS Unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0)    Anybody can help ?

[10:39] <Grant101> no
[10:39] <BoomSie> whoops, sounds familiar. You have the mixer issue too, sorry :)
[10:39] <DaBeowulf> ah nm found it myself: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/116193 lucky me I had the timezone set to Berlin anyway..
[10:40] <BoomSie> did you use OSS before ?
[10:40] <Grant101> have you managed to fix it
[10:40] <simplechat> avi's worked with feisty.
[10:40] <Grant101> I have a realtek HD sound card
[10:40] <BoomSie> no, a simple work around I have now, but fully fixed WITH an end mixer/master, no :(
[10:40] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: No sensors found! Make sure you loaded all the kernel drivers you need. Try sensors-detect to find out which these are.
[10:40] <BoomSie> that's why I'm also in #alsa
[10:40] <Ptrack88> can someone help me?
[10:40] <BoomSie> I don't know if I should make a bug-report on the Alsa site or Ubuntu now :(

[10:42] <Ptrack88> but I had a NIC driver problem
[10:42] <Ptrack88> unplugged
[10:42] <Grant101> boomsie is your mute light constantly on
[10:42] <BoomSie> :) well, then you just hit the jackpot, this is the first time I encountered this audio problem in 5 years :D
[10:42] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: No such file or directory
[10:42] <Grant101> hahahahah
[10:42] <Ptrack88> put in a new NIC and reinstalled
[10:42] <smmagic> Always with the problems
[10:42] <lobo_nz> tehknow, got it sorted had to install xserver-xgl to get my window decorations working - just incase someone else bugs you :)
[10:42] <Ptrack88> now it gets through the installs fine
[10:42] <Ptrack88> no errors
[10:42] <Ptrack88> and boots the LIVE cd fine
[10:42] <marlon_> guten morgen
[10:43] <serada> please help ..... my sound is not working anymore.
[10:43] <Ptrack88> but when I reboot, it hangs on a black screen with a flashing underscore
[10:43] <BoomSie> Grant101: depends what I do, if I put EVERYTHING on ALSA (in the sound) and I select the Master in the list, the mute button will go on and off like it should BUT ... the sound won't cooperate/go along. However, if I select PCM, the sound WILL go on and of and softer&harder. But this isn't the way it should be
[10:43] <smmagic> Have you tried reinstalling again?
[10:43] <Ptrack88> yes
[10:43] <smmagic> Because if there is no errors..
[10:43] <Ptrack88> 2 times for both server and desktop
[10:43] <smmagic> Have you done a google on it?
[10:43] <Grant101>  i keep gettiny these error messages when i hit test button
[10:44] <BoomSie> also, with the icon on the taskbar (the speaker) click it 2 times and make sure it's on File -> Change Device -> HDA Intel
[10:44] <Ptrack88> no
[10:44] <smmagic> Try that then
[10:44] <smmagic> I'll even help
[10:44] <BoomSie> I know, cause it's blocked cause of the previous setting, it requires a reboot or you need to kill the application that is blocking your sound device :(
[10:44] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: no /etc/init.d/module-init-tools ?
[10:44] <Kevin_Wolf> Can anyone please help me with my X1600 not showing any display under X?  I have googled and checked the ubuntu forums, there is a similar post with no solution.
[10:45] <drama1981> Kevin_Wolf do you get a shell?
[10:45] <Kevin_Wolf> Yes
[10:45] <amun> I did something... bad. All the windows I open have no titlebar. I can't minimize, maximize, or nothing unless i right click on taskbar and select it. anyone here know how i can make it go back to having a titlebar?
[10:45] <Minnozz> well, this was one of the random failures of my wireless network -_-
[10:45] <chronographer> so any ideas onhow to fix this error? Xlib: connection to display ":0.0" refused by launcher which happens when I try to run this comand DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/deluge  in a new (ctrl alt F1) terminal, and presumably when cron runs it too.
[10:46] <Matic`Makovec> If you take a look at http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/ . I am woundering how could I make my desktop such a cube as there's the picture of it on the right side of this page?
[10:46] <Kevin_Wolf> X runs I can hearit play the sound, it just says "NO SIGNAL" on my LCD
[10:46] <Grant101> I downloaded new realtek drivers but i do not know how to install them
[10:46] <Kevin_Wolf> It does this afte rloading the LiveCD as well as after installing from alt install, I am using the AMD64 installer.
[10:46] <amun> err. sorry.
[10:46] <BoomSie> First time Linux for you Grant101 :$?
[10:46] <chronographer> amun: press 'alt F2' and type 'metacity --replace'  or 'compiz --replace'
[10:46] <Grant101> yes
[10:46] <serada> how is it that Ubuntu was released with such basic flaws as sound device problems???
[10:46] <drama1981> its probobally because of the xserver-xorg-ati driver then. its seriously screwed. try sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-fglrx
[10:46] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41493/
[10:46] <m0u5e> anyone know what LCD screen the dell m1330 uses?
[10:46] <BoomSie> don't download drivers, it's too windows style. But you have realtek?
[10:46] <jhaig> How can I load things (files, apps, etc) only my PDA (Palm Z22)?  With Edgy I was using JPilot, as the Gnome integration didn't seem to work properly for me but now with Gutsy I'm using Evolution, but there are only options for sync.
[10:46] <BoomSie> not HDA Intel?
[10:46] <weltall> does anyone know how to disable the backlight management in gnome?
[10:46] <amun> chronographer,  also, how do i use compiz ?
[10:46] <m0u5e> the WLED version
[10:47] <Grant101> yes boomsie
[10:47] <Grant101> realtek
[10:47] <chronographer> read in the forums 'www.ubuntuforums.org'
[10:47] <Kevin_Wolf> drama198: okay, I will do that real quick!  I did a similar command but it wasnt the same so I'm going to give it a shot.
[10:47] <laur> Hi, I'm having trouble with Gutsy's LTSP. I've configured /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf properly, made tftpd-hpa run as a daemon, ran ltsp-build-client and ltsp-update-image, yet when I try to boot a client it fails to mount the root filesystem. (Mounting /rofs on /root/rofs failed: Invalid argument). What could be wrong?
[10:47] <chronographer> just use metacity until you know /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:47] <smmagic> Ptrack88: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=451536
[10:47] <Ptrack88> hmm
[10:47] <smmagic> Might help
[10:47] <Ptrack88> it doesnt even get to GRUB
[10:47] <Grant101> How do I install drivers
[10:47] <amun> specifically, how do i use the cube function of compiz ?
[10:48] <kilopopo> where can i find windows 32 codecs?
[10:48] <DASPRiD|lazy> hm guys, when i activate beryl as window manager, all window borders disapear. but when i choose compiz or metacity (wonder ^^), they work, didnt had this problem with ubuntu 7.04
[10:48] <Gun_Smoke> amun: Try the mouse wheel..
[10:48] <chronographer> install compiz-settings-manager or something like that
[10:48] <amun> gun_smoke: it moves me from 1 desktop to another. is that right?
[10:48] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: strange. Sensors should now work after a reboot, but that's not the Linux way...
[10:49] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981:  It says it can't find that package.
[10:49] <Gun_Smoke> amun: click and hold.
[10:49] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: I've already tried a reboot.
[10:49] <BoomSie> Grant101 meet me @ #testchan (I get crazy cause of all the other msg's)
[10:49] <Ptrack88> smmagic, dont get a splash screen or a loader

[10:49] <smmagic> Geez..
[10:49] <Dumptruck> Hello - Why would I not be able to have write support for internal drives with NTFS-3g?
[10:49] <Ptrack88> it passes bios and goes straight to the black screen with the flashing underscore
[10:49] <smmagic> Something is way whacked
[10:49] <Joel_vx> Hi all, can anyone give me some advice on getting optical output on ubuntu 7.10 ?
[10:50] <Grant101> ok
[10:50] <drama1981> Kevin_Wolf ok maybe the repo isnt enabled. give me a few mins and ill see if i can figure out exactly how to do it from shell.
[10:50] <Andycasss> I have disabled the pass in vista, and in samba im logging as a guest
[10:50] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: I've been at this for hours.
[10:50] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: Thank you!
[10:50] <Ptrack88> I use the bios boot option and select the hard drive and still no dice
[10:50] <Gun_Smoke> amun: working?
[10:50] <Dumptruck> I am trying to save a boot.ini file to the windows drive
[10:50] <smmagic> Doesn't even get to GRUB either..
[10:50] <amun> hrmm. for some reason the compiz --replace isnt working. it worked the first time, but not the 2nd. any other solution?
[10:50] <Joel_vx> normal sound is working fine, but i just plugged in my toslink optical lead into my amp, no sound.. adjusted all the mixer settings?
[10:50] <Laser87> Gun_Smoke: after sudo sensors-detect ?
[10:50] <amun> Gun_Smoke, nope. just changes desktop
[10:50] <m0u5e> so anyone know what the dell m1330 uses as a WLED screen?
[10:50] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: not sure if it matters, but I tried to install xserver-xgl and xorg-drivers-fglrx and those didn't fix it.
[10:50] <m0u5e> i'm trying to configure my monitor to correclty display
[10:51] <Ptrack88> is there something wrong if the install sees the HD as SCSI3 and SCSI4... they used to be 1 and 2 I believe
[10:51] <smmagic> Are you duel booting with windows?
[10:51] <beni> How can I list all the packages I've installed so I can install them again if I reinstall Ubuntu
[10:51] <N[i]X> hello, i just downloaded the upgrade to ubuntu buti have 2 problems, i dont know how to chnge by keyboard layout and how to switch off that graphics thing that makes it look like a window enlarges from nothing when i open somthing.. it is slowing down my computer
[10:51] <beni> smmagic: trying to run windows apps?
[10:51] <Ptrack88> nope but there was an entry in the MBR left over from the RAID 5 config I pulled with drive out of
[10:51] <smmagic> Nope..
[10:51] <amun> actually, xchat has no titlebar, but the other windows do. how do i get the xchat titlebar back?
[10:51] <Gun_Smoke> Laser87: That is correct.. Still nothing.. But just for the heck of it.. I'll try again.. back in a few.
[10:51] <beni> amun minimize and hen open it up again
[10:52] <Ptrack88> a few installs ago, when it used to show grub... windows vista/longhorn was an option
[10:52] <smmagic> Just a long shot, but maybe format your drive and reinstall
[10:52] <gpaolo> ciao c'e un italiano
[10:52] <Javid-> is it possible to get better than firefox 1.0 on ubuntu 5.10? upgrading the distro isn't an option
[10:52] <Moduliz0r> how do i configure grub not to show the menu?
[10:52] <beni> Javid: sudo apt-get upgrade?
[10:52] <Ptrack88> can i format from the livecd or should I install it in another machine (windows) and format it
[10:52] <Arafangion> Javid-: You could install Opera...
[10:52] <zethero1> has anyone figured out whats the problem with the sound faults in Gutsy?
[10:52] <smmagic> You could burn a parted magic live cd
[10:52] <neur1> hello , how do I find my windows partition which was . . . and now isn't showing up on the desktop?

[11:00] <simplechat> when you go crontab -e, do you see your previous edits?
[11:00] <neur1> it was there but hmm
[11:00] <beni> bam_: which allows only local client to connect to mysql
[11:00] <bam_> I have added a user that is set to be able to connection from "%", anywhere.
[11:00] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: Okay!  No rush ^^

[11:01] <kaw22> beni: "" didn't help anything unfortunately
[11:01] <bam_> beni: Do you know where it is? It would really help me out.
[11:01] <Andycasss> I have removed pass share in vista
[11:01] <simplechat> kaw22: odd. brty off
[11:01] <simplechat> *very odd
[11:01] <Gun_Smoke> amun: yeah you need to go an change the keys.. umm.. I forget where.. try holding down left shift or ctrl or alt or something..  and the guys at #xgl would know more.
[11:01] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: It doesn't look like it figured out I have an ATi card, it says "Generic Video Card" and is using vesa, maybe mine doesn't like vesa.
[11:01] <neur1> be back going to check if I can still boot vista lol
[11:02] <neur1> thanks
[11:02] <beni> bam_: /etc/mysql/my.cnf look for bind-address and change this to something different than 127.0.0.1
[11:02] <Moduliz0r> that GrubHowTo doesn't tell me how to make it like it used to be
[11:02] <kaw22> simplechat: Is there a default folder I could try and execute from to make sure it works? If it's something with rights
[11:02] <bam_> I am looking at the "my.cnf" file and it says "bind-address		= 127.0.0.1"
[11:02] <beni> kaw22: damn :/ Just thought it would be that typo
[11:02] <beni> Moduliz0r: let me search for you
[11:02] <bam_> oh... :)
[11:02] <bam_> change it to what?
[11:02] <Moduliz0r> beni: It used to not show the menu
[11:03] <beni> bam_: yeah, 127.0.0.1 means only localhost can access. change it to your static lan ip
[11:03] <beni> bam_: or internet ip
[11:03] <kaw22> beni: In the faqs they don't use quotes either though
[11:03] <bam_> ok. let me try it out.
[11:03] <phishie> i do not think it would be advisable to allow global access for mysql though...
[11:03] <drama1981> ok Kevin_Wolf in that case lets try something different first. exit out of the xorg.conf ctrlx i believe
[11:04] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981
[11:04] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: okay I exited it.  (crappy laptop keyboard)
[11:04] <karin5482> hello, i would like to know how can i remove linux totaly from my HDD ? (even when i make format the boot of the linux still ther)
[11:04] <beni> phishie: yeah but he wants to connect from the network. ;)
[11:04] <simplechat> karin5482: boot disk, grab gparted and remove each and every partition
[11:04] <drama1981> now do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:05] <simplechat> then reinstall something else
[11:05] <rbs-tito> karin5482: Likely it has overwritten the MBR. Is it Windows you want to replace linux with?
[11:05] <phishie> beni: ic... hahahah *smack*
[11:05] <beni> karin5482: Just insert a Windows CD and install it
[11:05] <simplechat> beni: yeah, windows'll kill anything else
[11:05] <simplechat> :)
[11:05] <rbs-tito> karin5482: Yes, what beni said!

[11:06] <beni> jscinoz: try ssh instead of SSH
[11:06] <Hadeshorn> could someone think of a reason why my computer is sending and receiving packets when I am not doing anything on the internet?
[11:07] <rbs-tito> karin5482: Absolutely, if you tell it to use the entire disk
[11:07] <beni> jscinoz: wait. That was dumb, forget it :)
[11:07] <jscinoz> beni, im using ssh (lowercase)
[11:07] <jscinoz> :P
[11:07] <karin5482> thanks :)
[11:07] <Hadeshorn> Because if I was under windows, I would think I was compromised. But under linux im not sure how easy that is to do?
[11:07] <rbs-tito> zxcv24: What does network manager applet say about the connection?

[11:07] <smmagic> Ptrack88: Tell me how it goes
[11:07] <chronographer> anyone good at fixing xauthority?
[11:07] <rbs-tito> Hadeshorn: You could check the packets, it could be any number of things
[11:08] <simplechat> Hadeshorn: grab etherreal and check whats happening
[11:08] <rbs-tito> Hadeshorn: The ethereal packet sniffer will show you the packets
[11:08] <beni> Moduliz0r: we can manually edit /boot/grub/menu.lst (with sudo please) and change the time etc
[11:08] <simplechat> also ps aux | less and look for anything suspicious

[11:10] <N[i]X> how do i change my keyboard layout
[11:10] <N[i]X> _
[11:10] <N[i]X> ?
[11:10] <Dumptruck> I get the following error:
[11:10] <rbs-tito> Dumptruck: IS this gutsy?
[11:10] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: It worked!  I love you!
[11:10] <beni> Moduliz0r: searchin..
[11:10] <Kevin_Wolf> drama1981: Thank you sooooooo much!
[11:10] <drama1981> np always glad to help
[11:10] <joerack> rbs-tito : it was last boot... however it said that i needed permissions to mount but now it's completely missing

[11:11] <Dumptruck> rbs-tito: nope feisty
[11:11] <rbs-tito> joerack: Do you know which device it is (eg /dev/hda1 ?)
[11:11] <kode> N[i]X, if you have gnome, just go to system =>preferences=>keyboard, there click on the layout tab and add your layout and use it as fedault
[11:11] <c_lisp> nix under system-prefrences has a keyboard program to change prefrences
[11:11] <zxcv24> rbs-tito: i'm not sure but don't think so because i get a connection when i switch to windows that i have installed on the same computer, and on my laptop with ubuntu it works
[11:11] <jscinoz> hey guys, since this morning, i can no longer use ssh, it returns "SSH: hostnamehere: Name or Service not known" for any server i try, i can ping these servers and it get replies, also attempting to connect via IP adress has the same error, what can i do?
[11:12] <rbs-tito> Dumptruck: Gutsy has it set up by default, I know alot of people had trouble with it in Feisty, even when stable
[11:12] <jabae> GUYS IM HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE ON MY FRESH UBUNTU INSTALLATION. MY CAPSLOCK KEY DOESNT WORK.
[11:12] <drama1981> Kevin_Wolf now you wont have direct rendering or 3d acceration most likely. you can try opening restricted drivers manager and enabling the check mark but it may break it again im not sure
[11:12] <Andycasss> Im trying to use this command in fstab: //servername/sharename  /media/mountname  smbfs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0 But for some reason it cant log in to my vista host, says "The attempt to log in failed."
[11:12] <Moduliz0r> !caps
[11:12] <phishie> wers: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart?
[11:12] <ubotu> PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.

[11:12] <Dumptruck> I am not that familiar with the upgrade process
[11:12] <Dumptruck> how do I do it?
[11:13] <rbs-tito> zxcv24: OK, try going to system > administration > networking
[11:13] <Dumptruck> and will all of my files be saved in the same place?

[11:13] <Dumptruck> excellant
[11:13] <Moduliz0r> beni: I found it, it was hiddenmenu in the menu.lst
[11:13] <beni> Moduliz0r: this will help you to remove some "old" kernels http://www.go2linux.org/clean-linux-kernel-images-grub-menu
[11:13] <drama1981> dimas_ what is ov51x? im not farmilar with it. also not im not the greatset with ubuntu im just farmilar with what fixed my probs
[11:13] <rafkid> gutsy won't upgrade - it thinks I have a network problem when looking for files - wrong of course as I am chatting here atm - any ideas?
[11:13] <rbs-tito> Dumptruck: they will if you upgrade throught update=-manager. If you use the CD you should back up. it is wise to back up anyway though
[11:13] <martii> hi guys
[11:13] <beni> Moduliz0r: oh yeh :) Gotta blog that

[11:14] <rbs-tito> zxcv24: It should work then, but you won't be able to use the network-manager applet.
[11:14] <joerack> rbs-tito : nope, is there a way to discover it
[11:14] <wers> phishie, tried it but still no difference

[11:24] <rbs-tito> linux26: It doesn't come with a desktop environment.
[11:24] <zxcv24> rbs-tito: hmm, it seems my internet is working now, i got an ipadress
[11:24] <notgod> jimmy_: I don't understand. This is supposed to be the wonderful new built-in 3D desktop in 7.10.
[11:24] <murlidhar> Dumptruck: err i am not sure i can help u in fstab cuz i don't want to break ur filesystem so it is better if u ask a geek
[11:24] <rbs-tito> zxcv24: There we go, it should just work from now on
[11:24] <saloxin> linux26: or install desktop and apt-get install apache2 ssh proftpc ircd

[11:24] <ParanoyaM> Does anybody know what is /bin/modprobe abnormal exit?
[11:24] <linux26> rbs-tito: How so? I was thinking of getting the desktop edition and installing the server-related software
[11:25] <drama1981> mao thats because you are using compiz you cant use dri and compiz at the same time. last i knew anyway
[11:25] <notgod> jimmy_: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour#head-53fb1bb59cc05521a2a6f644d4808ff140d9adaa
[11:25] <zxcv24> rbs-tito: ahh, thanks :)
[11:25] <rbs-tito> zxcv24: But we have set it to manually configured, so network-manager wont work. This will be fine if you don't intend to swap your network often
[11:25] <rbs-tito> rbs-tito: This is how things were done pre-network manager
[11:25] <beni> Mr: Couldnt you just plug the external drive on again?
[11:25] <mao> drama1981: Ahh... Doesn't vsyncing depend on DRI though?
[11:25] <Mr> beni lol yeah I tried that ;)
[11:26] <rbs-tito> linux26: Ubuntu has two editions. Desktop and Server, desktop has a GUI, server has LAMP
[11:26] <drama1981> mao idk exactly but i dont think so
[11:26] <rbs-tito> linux26: Ubuntu guide hasa fantastic guide to getting a LAMP server running on UBuntu desktop
[11:26] <hazman> hey, yesterday it was fine, but today aMSN just says offline, can someone help me fix it plz?
[11:26] <jimmy_> notgod:  not sure about what its supposed to be..  but under themes jsut fetch some in emerald
[11:26] <linux26> rbs-tito: I know, and I was thinking of getting the desktop part and installing the server things rather than getting the server part and installing the desktop things
[11:26] <Mr> beni its not like I come running for help without trying some stuff first... I attatched the HDD again... no difference...
[11:26] <rafkid> hi peeps - my gutsy upgrade does not work - it stalls near the end with an error message indicating the network is down  - there is a text message indicating bad repositories online? any ideas?

[11:26] <rbs-tito> linux26: Yeah, that is the way I do it
[11:27] <Dumptruck> hello everyone - I am trying to copy a boot.ini file to my NTFS disc  - I am using feisty yawn and the NTFS-config will not allow me to use NTFS support for internal drives - I have been told to use fstab but I am not familiar with it

[11:27] <rbs-tito> linux26: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#Apache_HTTP_Server
[11:27] <Dumptruck> why would someone say that I will have more problems when I upgrade?
[11:27] <mao> drama1981: Well, maybe someone here knows how to get compiz to vsync. I have it enabled in ccsm, but there is a bit of tearing when rotating the cube and in video.
[11:27] <JW_704> ok, sc_serv is saying that "error opening client socket! FATAL ERROR! Some other process is using this port!"
[11:27] <JW_704> :(
[11:27] <pulseezar> this sounds like a silly and fairly unimportant question, but how can I change the folder that the screensaver GLSlideshow uses to display pictures?
[11:27] <RiffRaff> Hi , i just installed a toUcam II pro webcam on gusty which workswith the pwc driver. the problem is that the display is way more inaccurate than on windows, and i don't find where i can configure it. can anyone help me?
[11:28] <linux26> rbs-tito: thanks
[11:28] <saloxin> it's like ubuntu forgot to publish "howto upgrade" and just unleashed new repos

[11:30] <mao> lol at xchat locking up
[11:30] <ParanoyaM> Beni what is behave?
[11:30] <beni> jscinoz: is the ssh prot open on the server?
[11:30] <drama1981> mao only thing i really know about is that compiz and dri cant coexist. because of fglrx not supporting them both at the same time. its supposted to change if aiglx ever gets supported by the fglrx driver
[11:30] <Shapeshifter> lol
[11:30] <phishie> jscinoz: try putty?
[11:30] <beni> ParanoyaM: please dont write uppercase only this is annoying
[11:30] <jscinoz> yes,, the server has worked fine before, and this happens on any server
[11:30] <Mr> beni but that dude fooled arround with the kernel... I didn't change anything in that direction
[11:30] <jscinoz> phishie, why would i sue putty when i'm using ubuntu?
[11:30] <pulseezar> @mao maybe it'spossible to dl a 3rd party screensaver?
[11:31] <beni> Mr: No they changed their grub stuff
[11:31] <rbs-tito> ParanoyaM: Just a certain netiquette of writing in upper case. It makes it easier if you just state your problem and wait for an answer :)

[11:32] <dante2_> heya. it's really a pain that the latest Firefox update is not available as a DEB. "check for updates" is also grayed out. how to install 2.0.0.8 (i know 2.0.0.7 was not linux-specific, but this is getting ridiculous)
[11:32] <cyphase> rbs-tito: yes, and i think that's partially the problem
[11:32] <Mr> beni yes... I checked and it had a UUID instead of a /dev/hdaX   so I tried different hda3 hda2 etc... still same problem
[11:32] <RiffRaff> does anyone know at least where i can seek for an answer? i didn't find anything and i'm quite a newbie
[11:32] <cyphase> rbs-tito: is it possible w32codecs could cause a problem with that?
[11:32] <rbs-tito> tsukasa: Oh dear, is this Gutsy
[11:32] <tsukasa> rbs-tito, i tried reinstalling it no avail... i also deleted ~/.openoffice still didnt fix it
[11:32] <tsukasa> yes

[11:33] <cyphase> rbs-tito: yes, but it happened in fesity as well
[11:33] <tsukasa> rbs-tito, is there a fix for it?
[11:33] <saloxin> Mr: all disks are now sdX - try sda2,3 etc
[11:33] <beni> pulseezar: hi
[11:33] <pulseezar> lol, i thought i'd been disconnected..
[11:33] <saloxin> rafkid: ;-)
[11:33] <WaltzingAlong> Dumptruck: cat /etc/lsb-release
[11:33] <Dumptruck> ok - is there an easy way to upgrade to 7.10 without burning a cd?
[11:33] <cyphase> rbs-tito: personally, i never used totem for audio anyway
[11:33] <rbs-tito> tsukasa: That sounds strange. Maybe you have a bad install of Ubuntu? Dodgy CD or download?
[11:33] <Dumptruck> I have 7.04
[11:33] <saloxin> rafkid: welcome to new troubles
[11:34] <beni> Dumptruck: wait a second of course its very easy
[11:34] <Mr> saloxin what do you mean all disks are sd2 sd3 ?
[11:34] <cyphase> rbs-tito: but i'm curious as to what's causing this problem
[11:34] <Mr> saloxin I have IDE not Sata
[11:34] <tsukasa> rbs-tito, nah. although i did use a nonexistant font when i started it the first time
[11:34] <saloxin> the scsi and ide subsystems have been merged - so now all disks are named sdX
[11:34] <rbs-tito> cyphase: Neither do I, but I do use the gstreamer backend. Can rythymbox play the files because that uses the same backend
[11:34] <tsukasa> rbs-tito, so its very possible the preferences are corrupted because of that
[11:34] <cyphase> rbs-tito: yea, it can
[11:34] <tsukasa> rbs-tito, problem is i dont know where OOO keeps all of its preferences
[11:34] <Zlew> grub keeps throwing me an error 22, even though i followed the instructions to fix it..do i have to point it to my linux or windows partition?
[11:34] <JW_704> Can someone help me setup a Shoutcast server please? I am having issues
[11:34] <cyphase> rbs-tito: this really seems to be a totem problem..
[11:34] <tsukasa> its in like 9 places from what i have heard
[11:34] <RiffRaff> beni: any idea?
[11:35] <saloxin> Mr: i have a thinkpad 40p with ageold ide disks. root is /dev/sda1
[11:35] <rbs-tito> tsukasa: Open synaptic, ununinstall all of the open office files but don't just remove them, choose to completely remove them
[11:35] <cyphase> rbs-tito: let me try deleting the configuration for totem.. i don't know if i've tried that
[11:35] <rbs-tito> tsukasa: Then try reinstalling. This way everything, including preferences, is deleted
[11:35] <Mr> saloxin hmm ok so I should try different sda  "versions" ?
[11:35] <saloxin> Mr: yeo
[11:35] <beni> RiffRaff: Err.. This sounds like the driver is kinda bad.. :/

[11:37] <Dumptruck> doesn't work
[11:37] <beni> Moduliz0r: OpenGl
[11:37] <Moduliz0r> beni: Cool, thanks
[11:37] <ptrack88> I believe it is installing the grub loader to the 500gb drive instead of the 160gb drive the installer is installing to.
[11:37] <Andycasss> Why cant i access vista shares when i dont have a password protection on in vista
[11:37] <smmagic> Longhorn? Like vista?
[11:37] <rbs-tito> ptrack88: Is this a GRUB problem?
[11:37] <beni> RiffRaff: go into console and typ "man pwcset"
[11:37] <Andycasss> Ubuntu tells me that access was denied
[11:37] <ptrack88> so right now I am DELETING the partitions on the drive
[11:37] <Andycasss> In vista, it shows that one client is connected to the share

[11:38] <ptrack88> like vista
[11:38] <RiffRaff> ah scuse me
[11:38] <smmagic> Just can't wait for the middle of summer
[11:38] <RiffRaff> it was setpwc
[11:38] <ptrack88> i believe it is picking up some vista files on the my 500gb (different drive) and trying to install grub on it
[11:38] <ptrack88> instead of the drive that has linux on it
[11:38] <ptrack88> so guess what I did...
[11:38] <ptrack88> I unplugged the 500gb
[11:38] <ptrack88> didnt give it a choice
[11:39] <Dumptruck> how about System>administrator>upgrade manager>upgrade?
[11:39] <ptrack88> now it is deleting partitions, I will do a fresh install... reboot and hope.

[11:40] <Dumptruck> Some third party entries in your sources.list were disabled. You can re-enable them after the upgrade with the 'software-properties' tool or your package manager.  Why would it do this?
[11:40] <ptrack88> a question
[11:40] <beni> saloxin: this is possible but very advances
[11:40] <ptrack88> this one if for all of you
[11:40] <ptrack88> what SCSI# should display for one drive only during install
[11:40] <gordonjcp> Dumptruck: in case they provide packages that aren't compatible with gutsy
[11:40] <ptrack88> right now i think i am up to SCSI6
[11:40] <ptrack88> it keeps rising
[11:40] <saloxin> UltraNav: libapache2-mod-auth-pam
[11:41] <saloxin> beni: yep. vpn has made me cry many times

[11:42] <niller> only issue i have atm is that i cant get my bluetooth mouse to work

[11:45] <beni> rbs-tito: they got windows keys, dont they? :)
[11:45] <ptrack88> I have a 160gb drive... how should I allocate it?
[11:45] <rbs-tito> rbs-tito: Erm, nope.
[11:45] <saloxin> Mr: sounds like your grub configuration contains the wrong reference to root partition.
=== princess^ is now known as girasole
[11:45] <jd2100> smmagic: How is it?
[11:45] <ptrack88> it would be 4gb swap if I did 2x ram
[11:46] <rbs-tito> beni: It didn't come with a sticker, a copy of Windows or any windows documentation
[11:46] <niller> murlidhar: it only sees my cell phone which is laying on the table
[11:46] <murlidhar> !bluetooth mouse

[11:46] <kyja> how do we get a webcam to work??
[11:46] <jd2100> The Dell.
[11:46] <Mr> saloxin as I said it is referenced to by UUID instead of /dev/hda2 or whatever... so when I try to edit it to /dev/hda2 or /dev/sda2 ... but that doesnt make a difference
[11:46] <beni> rbs-tito: ok.. just read a test about these ones and they were a bit bitchy because DELL didn't do it "with love" you know? :)
[11:46] <murlidhar> niller: then u may have to configure it from terminal
[11:46] <ptrack88> smmagic
[11:46] <beni> rbs-tito: so there is no webcam and stuff
[11:46] <smmagic> Thats my nick
[11:46] <saloxin> Mr: only way of finding this out is via a live cd
[11:46] <niller> ok
[11:46] <ptrack88> would it mess me up if the scsi is showing up as SCSI6 in install
[11:46] <jlowell> anyone? I'd like to use the "native" broadcom drivers, but I do not have other than wireless internet access, what files and where can I find them do I need to be able to acomplish this? thanks~

[11:47] <Pierre> i
[11:47] <saloxin> Mr: so you can figure out which partition is your root partition (sdX), and what UUID it actually has
[11:47] <Mr> saloxin problem is I am relatively new to linux (a few weeks) and I wouldn't really know what to do inside the terminal of the live CD
[11:47] <Pierre> anyone with a nvidia 8600gt and a 64bit system?
[11:47] <rbs-tito> beni: No webcam. It is annoying because it has a "Media direct" button which, should, boot into a seperate OS to be used as a jukebox/dvd player type thing. They removed it with the Ubuntu version so it is a dead key
[11:47] <smmagic> I wouldn't think so
[11:47] <smmagic> Linux would just install there
[11:47] <saloxin> Mr: desktop livecd has gui, firefox, irc client ;-)
[11:47] <murlidhar> niller: no problem if u have any doubt u have this channel
[11:47] <ptrack88> what about UUID
[11:47] <beni> rbs-tito: yeah, stuff like this :)
[11:48] <ptrack88> does it need to be a certain one
[11:48] <Pierre> wondering what's wrong with the bin drivers, crash at boot if I use them (fresh gusty install)
[11:48] <rbs-tito> beni: I am currently working on getting it to starting Ubuntu with a dedicated xsession running just rhythmbox
[11:48] <ptrack88> think that could have anything to do with it?
[11:48] <Mr> saloxin was that an offer to walk me through it? :-P
[11:48] <beni> rbs-tito: good luck
[11:48] <saloxin> Mr: in my early days I often had to reinstal if I fscked my grub. anything on there with value or is a reinstall just as easy
[11:48] <smmagic> Well..since everything else has failed, could me
[11:48] <beni> Mr: Probably? ;)
[11:48] <grndslm> sooo... gutsy uses beagle *and* tracker?
[11:48] <tsukasa> whats the package for standard english locale?
[11:48] <rbs-tito> beni: Oh, and it comes with the resolution all "stretched" because it uses the i810 instead of the intel xorg driver
[11:49] <ptrack88> i am currently running mIRC on a windows box
[11:49] <ptrack88> and switching back and forth to the linux box
[11:49] <saloxin> Mr: hehe, we coul dtry. but grub problems make my head hurt. they got a confused vocabulary about "root"
[11:49] <beni> Mr: When I began with suse in the first week I reinstalled it about 10 Times because I fucked up my X-Server... The ATI drivers still suck
[11:49] <ptrack88> that way I will be in here until I get this settled
[11:49] <Mr> saloxin just a few small files like a presentation for university I have to hold etc... is it possible to save those kind of files within the LIVE CD ?
[11:49] <joerack> can someone help me with my hard disk disappeared?
[11:49] <saloxin> Mr: sure. ftp them somewhere from the livecd
[11:49] <joerack> I don't know how to mount it in ubuntu
[11:50] <ptrack88> brb smmagic
[11:50] <ptrack88> thanks for the help thus far
[11:50] <beni> Mr: Yes! Just boot Live CD and put the Files on your memstick or upload them to rapidshare
[11:50] <Andycasss> how do i see my samba version?
[11:50] <smmagic> If I helped at all
[11:50] <rbs-tito> Andycasss: Synaptic?
[11:50] <Mr> beni saloxin ok maybe a reinstall would be faster
[11:50] <saloxin> Mr: or use todays universal document repo: mail them to yourself
[11:50] <Andycasss> Umm, sorry?
=== TheDreamer is now known as Youri
[11:50] <Mr> hehe ;)
[11:51] <rbs-tito> Andycasss: system > administration > synaptic. Search for samba
[11:51] <rbs-tito> Andycasss: Version numbers are listed
[11:51] <beni> Andycasss: probably "man smb" will help, I dont have it. In the manual there will be acommand to show the version
[11:51] <gvsa123> how can i set my login screen to be the right resolution?
[11:51] <saloxin> everybody upgrading: take backup and read the releasenotes: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710
[11:51] <saloxin> this is like operating systems 101.
[11:51] <sponix> Aye, did the ATI X1400 driver get cleared up, does it fire over without probs for Gusty ?
[11:52] <cyphase> rbs-tito: oh yea, i forgot about you :). Turns out once i reset Totem's gconf settings, it works fine

Remember, it WORKS in the live cd, so if we figure out what ubuntu does differently...

[12:55] <dmizer> LappyLlama: redhat is still free and being released under the title Fedora Core
[12:55] <Zaq> thanks, I'll take a look at that
[12:55] <detra> _keito_, Could that be the reason ??? Would it help if I tried to change the security to wep ?
[12:55] <Balaams_Miracle> LappyLlama: I think it's safe to say that Ubuntu is the most popular distro ever.
[12:55] <mdalek> dmizer,  its just Fedora now :p

[12:56] <detra> _keito_, ok 1 sec
[12:56] <_JSR_> i have a single question
[12:56] <erin> Good moring.  My issue: when I initially installed ndiswrapper, my wireless connection would connect on boot, and now it only does it half the time. Also, when I used to plug in the wired connection, the computer would automatically switch -- now I have to do it manually. Any advice?
[12:56] <fairway> what makes ubuntu a good distro?
[12:56] <rayb0t> shooood: yes.
[12:56] <espen> stefg, i only need to place a file in a program folder, to get a new skin :S
[12:56] <asbani> so how to disable the Option"Emulate3Button" "false"
[12:56] <_JSR_> is it possible to install ubuntu on an external usb hdd and boot to it with lilo or grub on main hdd
[12:56] <IHK> how do i flush the memory, since ubuntu uses more and more memory the more i use it, even though i have the same amount of programs running?
[12:56] <asbani> i did "false" naer it, but still when i click left+right it does mid-button...
[12:56] <_JSR_> my bios is not able to boot from usb
[12:57] <IHK> i guess it stores some of my recent calls in memory
[12:57] <shooood> wanna a download manager that integrate into the firefox
[12:57] <karin5482> hello, i have HDD with 2 partitions (1 ntfs , ubuntu) i would like to erase totaly the hdd including the MBR (i am planing make just 1 partition and install windows xp - in the installation of windows xp the system recognize just the ntfs partition) ??
[12:57] <IHK> so how do i flush those out?
[12:57] <Balaams_Miracle> asbani: You need to edit xorg.conf
[12:57] <shooood> rayb0t
[12:57] <picard_pwns_kirk> _JSR_: if it can't, it can't
[12:57] <asbani> Balaams_Miracle: i'm in xorg.conf
[12:57] <detra> _keito_, ok ... Now I found out that the problem isn't the security ...
[12:57] <asbani> Balaams_Miracle: I added "false" near the thing, but no luck
[12:57] <detra> _keito_, it still freezes ...
[12:57] <joerack> can someone help me in integrating the public key for screenlets
[12:57] <rayb0t> shooood: I don't know, I don't use any download managers for firefox.
[12:57] <_JSR_> well lilo or grub can't init usb hdd itself, like mounting it
[12:57] <void^> _JSR_: you need to put the /boot partition on the internal disk
[12:58] <_JSR_> yes
[12:58] <Zaq> video card's bus identifier? how do I know what to put there?
[12:58] <Balaams_Miracle> asbani: Did you a;sp save xorg.conf?
[12:58] <_keito_> detra: could you pastebin the results of sudo lshw -class network please
[12:58] <stefg> _JSR_, the problem will be that you need a grub partition on the internal HD. If you put grub in the internals hd MBR but the external isn't connected your box will be unbootable
[12:58] <Balaams_Miracle> asbani: whoops, something went wrong here
[12:58] <asbani> Balaams_Miracle: haha yes

[12:59] <stefg> AnssiP, yes, that's quite common
[12:59] <asbani> Balaams_Miracle: its just not working with Option"Emulate3Button" "false"
[12:59] <asbani> is there anyway else?
[12:59] <AnssiP> So is it documented in th Ubuntu official docs?
[12:59] <Zaq> and what about enabling kernel frame buffer device interface?
[12:59] <stefg> AnssiP, yes

[13:11] <aslan> monkey_: it does the same thing for me when I go there.
[13:11] <iancufegan> and when I booted up again it freezed with the ubuntu-desktop colour on screen (after I logged in)
[13:11] <feierfox> what could i do?

[13:11] <detra> _keito_, yup

[13:14] <victor__> when the Msttcorefonts fonts install I get this message "Msttcorefonts uses the DEbian FOnt MAnager (defoma). If you wish to use the fonts provided by this package under the X Window System, you must configure it to use defoma fonts.
[13:14] <victor__> The easiest way to do so is to use the x-ttcidfont-conf package. For more information, install the x-ttcidfont-conf package and consult its documentation under /usr/share/doc/x-ttcidfont-conf. For uses of msttcorefonts not related to the X Window System (e.g. printing) this is not required.

[13:18] <roo1> thx
[13:18] <VSpike> IdleOne: there aren't any for me - do I need to add a specific debug repo?
[13:18] <victor__> Nothing happens when I type:  grep -i defoma /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[13:18] <Dan2552> Is there a way to lock my CDROM drive so that it doesn't open when i press the button? (it's a laptop)
[13:18] <IdleOne> VSpike: let me check
[13:18] <detra> _keito_, g-260
[13:18] <detra> _keito_, but almost the same ...
[13:18] <picard_pwns_kirk> Dan2552: you could tape the drive shut
[13:18] <kane77> beni, maybe I'll program it myself ;)
[13:18] <basiljohn> today i upgraded from feisty to gutsy, the compiz config settings manager is not opening up
[13:19] <_keito_> detra: its not listed here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsZyxel
[13:19] <LinuxJuggalo> hey i just installed gutsy, one question is firestarter the icon supposed to hide or something? cause it feels like it crashed call me old fashioned but i like viewing the firestarter icon on the notification area
[13:19] <erin> dmizer: half the time, when Ubuntu starts up, the wireless connects automatically. Sometimes I have to actually click the networkmanager icon and select it.
[13:19] <basiljohn> get a ImportError: /var/lib/python-support/python2.5/compizconfig.so: undefined symbol: ccsStringToEdges error
[13:19] <Dan2552> picard_pwns_kirk: that would kill the mechanism, as it continues to push once the button has been pressed
[13:19] <detra> _keito_, Which means ?
[13:19] <beni> LinuxJuggalo: #compiz-fusion
[13:19] <notgod> ok, when I turn on advanced visual effects, I lose all my meny bars / window decorations / "the theme"

[13:19] <beni> notgod: then compiz / beryl doesnt work for you
[13:19] <picard_pwns_kirk> Dan2552: I remember there's a way, but I forget how...
[13:19] <dmizer> erin: do you use encryption of any kind?  and is this gutsy?
[13:20] <beni> notgod: do you have video card drivers installed?
[13:20] <test___> beni? ubuntu tr kanalına gelebilir misin?
[13:20] <erin> beni: That was exactly how it used to be set up! How do I do that?
[13:20] <detra> _keito_, So wrong drivers or unsupported by ubuntu ?
[13:20] <picard_pwns_kirk> Dan2552: lemme google that
[13:20] <LinuxJuggalo> beni: i dont have compiz enabled, it crashed my desktop 3 times so i got rid of it
[13:20] <notgod> beni: I get the 3d desktop. I can cube through virtual desktops.
[13:20] <VSpike> IdleOne: any idea which repo that's coming from?

[13:20] <dmizer> erin: is it a usb adapter?
[13:20] <VSpike> IdleOne: I'm doing "aptitude search kopete" and it's only showing me 3 items, and none are that one
[13:20] <LinuxJuggalo> !firestarter
[13:20] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[13:20] <beni> notgod: try to "reselect" a theme in your theme manager, does it work?
[13:20] <erin> dmizer: No, it's a card.

[13:21] <notgod> beni: nope.
[13:21] <beni> erin: gimme a second to search something on this topic
[13:21] <_keito_> detra: you can get it to work for sure but you may be using the wrong driver
[13:21] <IdleOne> VSpike: apt-cache policy kopete-dbgsym
[13:21] <_keito_> detra: could you post me a link to where you got it from
[13:21] <beni> notgod: could you ask the guys in the #compiz-fusion channel?
[13:21] <erin> beni: lol you and I both! I knew how to do this at one point...
[13:21] <dmizer> erin: try adding "/etc/init.d/networking restart" to the /etc/rc.local file

[13:47] <detra> Psi-Jack, Fair enough :)
[13:47] <cosmodad> is there an Ubuntu guide on getting suspending/hibernating to work?

[13:49] <MrPink> lo Can someone help me configure my MX500 in Gutsy... I am trying to edit xorg.conf but help would be nice ;)
[13:49] <Psi-Jack> Traveler6: A quick google search showed that Nvidia's Linux drivers do support the 8400M GS.
[13:49] <LM22> They are making lots of progress
[13:49] <heguru> cosmodad: ok then, fglrx (ati driver) breaks hibernate/suspend in gutsy but this doesn't apply to your card
[13:49] <SliMM> what about feisty?
[13:49] <attunix> I keep getting an error that <gtk/gtk.h> header file doesn't exist.

[13:50] <detra> _keito_, geforce 7600gs ... The driver I got from a program that automated th installation for me ... I spent many days getting it to work ... said that typical thing ... no screens found ... Then 1 week later ... found that program ... suddenly it just worked ...
[13:50] <myname> Mi god......tx for replying ubotu...but I still can´t understand that.....I´m not an expert user...just wanted to intall ubuntu to try....the problem: I have one partition of 60GB containing xp(FAT)...so I wanted to resize it...but I got a surprise when I came to know that ubuntu installer doesn´t allow you to do this.....Fedora allows you to do it!!...and ubuntu which it´s supposed to be "human being" easy...no...it´s very sad
[13:50] <Andycasss> Can i somehow see the apps that ive installed lately?
[13:50] <plooper> hey, ubuntu keeps freezing on my laptop
[13:50] <plooper> anyone know what it might be?
[13:50] <IdleOne> LM22: Im sure they are but if the goal is to be as good as windows then then have a low set of goals. they should be striving to be better . perhaps being able to run Windows apps and Linux app from the same VM would be cool
[13:50] <_keito_> detra: envy?
[13:50] <cosmodad> heguru: so what's the suggested method for hibernation in Ubuntu these days, suspend2/TuxOnIce or uswsusp?
[13:50] <detra> _keito_, thats it :)
[13:50] <saloxin> myname: worst case - resize in fedora and come back to the ubuntu cd afterwoods?
[13:50] <beni> myname: If you want to "resize" a 60gb xp partition all data will be lost!
[13:50] <VSpike> idleone: it said 'Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "kopete-dbgsym"'  ... and then listed a whole load of package that were being automatically kept back... so I did a dist-upgrade, and it's downloading a whole bunch of packages...
[13:50] <_keito_> detra: so proprietary driver then
[13:50] <xukun> I just installed new ubuntu 7.10 how can I see if compiz works?
[13:51] <h4writer> beni, yeah it worked. I had to do  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure portmap"  and let portmap not to bind to the loopback address? And now it works with 'sudo mount computername.local:/name/to/dir /name/to/mount'

[13:51] <bodq> hi, I don't see my wacom tablet input devices in `xinput list`, although they're defined in xorg.conf and work :( how to debug this? [report]
[13:51] <_keito_> detra: my box crashes when I try to run nexuiz at the moment so not feeling good about the upcoming ET:QW release
[13:51] <Psi-Jack> MrPink: Actually, I can look that up on another computer's config, sec.
[13:51] <detra> _keito_, I've never owned an ati myself ... That's why I'm using nvidia ... start with 1, stick with 1 :)
[13:51] <MrPink> Psi-Jack: That would be great, thanks!
[13:51] <asbani> in the gnome terminal, when i hilight something in the mouse to copy it, and somebody write something, all my hilight will disappear. Silly question but annoys me alot when i try to copy something >_< That i wish nobody talks when i hilight it.
[13:52] <beni> myname: If you have 60gb of data and it will be reduced to a 40gb partition at least 20gb will be in nirvana. And windows will probably be unable to handle the other 40gb
[13:52] <detra> _keito_, nexuiz ?
[13:52] <beni> asbani: LOL :)
[13:52] <abcde_> Does Gutsy exclude the i810 driver or something?  I had to install on my laptop with the alt CD, and now I can't enable Compiz for some reason, and it worked in feisty

[13:56] <beni> Gerrit: DVD's have copy protection software which we need programs for in order to read
[13:56] <Gerrit> beni: The error pasted is the output when playing with mplayer. xine and vlc say thay can't read the DVD in other words.
[13:56] <menisk> Gerrit, Get VLC, works beautifully for DVDs, at least it does for me.
[13:56] <beni> Gerrit: then it should work

[13:58] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[13:58] <Gerrit> beni: It should, but it doesn't, is there a way to make sure whether it is a hardware or a software problem, other than trying the DVD elsewhere? It's from the library.
[13:58] <sn00py> is "ath_pci" a network driver?
[13:58] <illuminaris> dmizer, I have an ATI Radeon 9800 PRO

[13:59] <VSpike> IdleOne: thanks.. could take some time!
[13:59] <Andycasss> Can i sort installed packages by date/time? :(
[13:59] <Gerrit> beni: I pasted the last lines of 'dmesg' in: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41513/

[14:01] <gb__> anyone running vmware on ubuntu here?
[14:01] <ThunderStruck> Tomi_G, what i said was for you

[14:04] <Jaymac> dipu, you can't
[14:04] <asbani> attunix: do you have a good command to make it look cool?
[14:04] <gb__> !beryl
[14:04] <ubotu> Beryl has been merged with Compiz to form Compiz-Fusion.  New Beryl installs are discouraged. See also !compiz

[14:04] <attunix> asbani: #beryl
[14:04] <attunix> asbani: Join the #beryl channel
[14:04] <sponix> gb__:  see ubuntuguide.org look under Samba for guest/public shares for no passwd setups
[14:04] <ThunderStruck> asbani, beryl is no more now its compiz and berylplugins are compiz-fusion
[14:04] <asbani> i don't use beryl or compiz tho
[14:04] <sponix> gb__:  or use smbpasswd -n username
[14:04] <gb__> sponix:  i did try no password too :(
[14:04] <attunix> asbani: then you need to install beryl-manager
[14:04] <Jaymac> dipu, actually you could try installing the motioneye package
[14:05] <ThunderStruck> asbani, than no need to worry about it ;)
[14:05] <gb__> i did all that sir

[14:05] <ubotu> Tomi_G: Unless you're Dutch or Flemish, or a government officier, the letter 'U' is not a pronoun.  If you want to be taken more seriously, please bother to type out the extra letters in "you".  The same goes for "why", "because", "anyone", and so on..
[14:05] <Gerrit> The first blocks can't be read, is there some "brute force" way to try to read as much as possible?

[14:15] <compwiz18> did Gutsy updaters take out all the Ubuntu mirrors again?
[14:15] <claudio75> hi to all...i'm italian and i've tried so many times to solve my problem in #ubuntu-it but without success...so i'm trying here....i've feisty 7.04 and i've a webcam trust wb-1200p...it should be ubuntu compatible but it doesn't work in my system....can you help me? ah...i'm sorry for my poor english
[14:15] <dmizer> ManuP: hey ... don't shoot the messeger ;)
[14:15] <ThunderStruck> dansku, hold on i think i wrote a how to a while ago let me see if i can find it
[14:15] <LM22> you guys love ies4linux but hate automatix, i don't get it
[14:15] <dansku> ok
[14:15] <dansku> thanks :)
=== boss is now known as bossi
[14:16] <ThunderStruck> np
[14:16] <kane77> steel_lady, actually 4 if you download the latest ies4linux.. (it has IE7 as well)
[14:16] <ManuP> dmizer, its running windows on it - and ubuntu. i have a ntfs partion there, as well
[14:16] <steel_lady> kane77 but I need IE to navigate, why ubotu says not to?
[14:16] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: that was better english than most people who speak it natively.
[14:16] <dmizer> ManuP: try scanning the drive in windows.
[14:16] <claudio75> ah...i bought 4 webcams...none of them is working
[14:16] <Minnozz> somebody please explain me how names like wlan0 get assigned, I really need it
[14:16] <ManuP> dmizer, with scandisk?
[14:16] <dmizer> ManuP: yup.
[14:16] <claudio75> jimmacdonald: uhmm...;)
[14:16] <compwiz18> steel_lady, IE is just for websites that need it to let you in, otherwise you should use firefox
[14:17] <compwiz18> steel_lady, firefox is probably more stable then IE will be
[14:17] <kane77> steel_lady, you can use it, but it's not the best browser ;)
[14:17] <ManuP> dmizer, but i dont think, ubuntu checks the ntfs-partionen on bootup. it only should be the root-partion.
[14:17] <claudio75> jimmacdonald: are you able to solve my problem?
[14:17] <jimmacdonald> All, I am having a networking issue. DHCP doesn't seem to be working for me.
[14:17] <Yodude> hello, i'm having problems burning an mp3 cd on ubuntu
[14:17] <LM22> I use opera for a lot of sites that don't like firefox
[14:17] <LM22> and it works great
[14:17] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: I don't think I am able to help much....
[14:17] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: I am here for support as well.
[14:17] <dmizer> ManuP: it doesn't ... but if there's a problem on the drive, it will probably show up in places other than just your linux partition.
[14:18] <compwiz18> I have yet to find a site that doesn't like firefox, except for the stupid ones that want me to install windows media player
[14:18] <claudio75> jimmacdonald: ok...so...what should i do?
[14:18] <dmizer> ManuP: plus it's a second opinion.
[14:18] <finux> anyone know about framebuffer issues during the install process
[14:18] <ThunderStruck> dansku, http://www.freewebs.com/ubuntufreak/tipstricks.htm
[14:18] <steel_lady> compwiz18, kane77, will IE in this way work for the pages that firefox can not display? what if I need the ultimate flask to go with it? how to install it on top?
[14:18] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: just hang around for a bit and see if someone is able to help. If not try the forums.
[14:18] <ManuP> dmizer, okay, will check it later. what would happen, if i turn fscheck off?
[14:18] <dansku> ThunderStruck, thanks!
[14:18] <IanLiu> I am using Avidemux but I don't know how to export my video with filters applied.. How I do it?
[14:18] <finux> anyone know about frame buffer issues during the install process
[14:19] <claudio75> jimmacdonald: i've already tried the forums
[14:19] <compwiz18> steel_lady, in theory IE should work just like it does in Windows
[14:19] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: you will get your answer for sure there but it's a bit slower to get it.
[14:19] <Tomi_G> menisk: Desktop effects still doesn't work and everything is so slow now :((
[14:19] <ThunderStruck> dansku, sorry it hasnt been updated in a while maybe one day this week ill update it and some scripts to it to make life easy
[14:19] <damianl> how do i change the applications menu icon, i have went through configuration editor and changed all the relevant places but nothing happens
[14:19] <dipu> How do install a driver - gspcav1
[14:19] <dmizer> ManuP: if there are problems being fixed every time it's checked, then you run the risk of getting an increasingly unstable desktop.
[14:19] <Zaq> is there a file besides xorg.conf that decides the sreen resolution?
[14:19] <fsahioho> does anyone know how to make the nvidia tvout works with gusty and restricted drivers? (sorry for the repetition :O)
[14:19] <menisk> Tomi_G, The 8.40.4 drivers may be dogey on your card, the 8.37.6 that come with gusty work, try them.
[14:20] <damianl> how do i change the applications menu icon, i have went through configuration editor and changed all the relevant places but nothing happens
[14:20] <Tomi_G> how do I downgrade them?
[14:20] <Dumptruck> I upgraded to gutsy,  I transfered the new boot.ini file, but now my old menu.lst has been changed.  Can someone help me set up my menu.lst file for a dual boot?
[14:20] <jimmacdonald> claudio75: did you try the italian or english forums?
[14:20] <menisk> Tomi_G, sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx should do the older ones./
[14:20] <howlingmadhowie> hi everybody :)
[14:20] <jube> well, gutsy is installed and seems to be working ok, but I'm sticking with feisty because everything is configured and setup just the way I like it on the feisty partition
[14:20] <steel_lady> compwiz18 I am a physicist and I know that practice is very different from theory if you do not take into account special circumstances. it won't work with flash player?
[14:20] <ManuP> dmizer, but if the errors are fixed, why do they occor on next boot? i dont acces the other partions.
[14:21] <compwiz18> steel_lady, it should work with flash player, but firefox works with flash player too
[14:21] <claudio75> hi to all...i'm italian and i've tried so many times to solve my problem in #ubuntu-it but without success...so i'm trying here....i've feisty 7.04 and i've a webcam trust wb-1200p...it should be ubuntu compatible (it uses spca5xx drivers) but it doesn't work in my system....can you help me? ah...i'm sorry for my poor english
[14:21] <kane77> steel_lady, yes it will work..
[14:21] <dmizer> ManuP: if the drive is bad ... the errors will reappear.
[14:21] <Wikzo> Is there any way to debug Firefox? I have tried several times where the browser freezes in Ubuntu 7.10 :S
[14:21] <compwiz18> steel_lady, you'll find that most of us in here will recommend you use firefox, so...

[14:24] <steel_lady> compwiz18 I am normally using firefox but I have to look for a job in sites that are only IE supported. why are you repeating so much that I have to use firefox. will my system get broken for using the other one?
[14:24] <void^> Dumptruck: where's your xp installed?
[14:24] <Dumptruck>  I upgraded to gutsy,  I transfered the new boot.ini file, but now my old menu.lst has been changed.  Can someone help me set up my menu.lst file for a dual boot?  how do I know what to put on the root line? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41517/
[14:24] <kane77> Wikzo, you might try it with -safe-mode flag
[14:25] <Dumptruck> void: on another hd
[14:25] <dmizer> ManuP: try "the ultimate boot cd" there's some good hdd tools on it.
[14:25] <amadeux> After I upgraded to gutsy, I am experiencing weird issues... For example, if I start the System > Preferences > Appearance app, it always hangs if I try to access anything but the first tab. Is this a known problem?
[14:25] <Wikzo> kane77: Ok, I got a "howto bug" link from ThunderStruck. Just reading it right now

[14:25] <holx> hi guys
[14:25] <damianl> how do i change the applications menu icon, i have went through configuration editor and changed all the relevant places but nothing happens
[14:25] <amadeux> Also, compiz fusion does not seem to be enabled
[14:25] <meoblast001> oh its starting again
[14:25] <holx> I have a question
[14:25] <compwiz18> steel_lady, no, go ahead and use IE for sites like that, that's the point.  I didn't realise that's why you wanted it installed.  At any rate, IE4Linux is what you want
[14:25] <Ant1jr> -.-
[14:25] <meoblast001> its doing a traceback

[14:27] <phishie> Ant1jr: u might want to elaborate a lil on your problem b4 anyone could help u
[14:27] <Tranto1> Hi, can someone give me an advice about upgrading Feisty to Gutsy? In my Feisty, I've already upgraded some components (kernel, Compiz Fusion, ntfs-3g...) and installed a lot of programs. Could someone tell me if I can mantain all the settings, including some modules (specifics for my VAIO laptop)?
[14:27] <meoblast001> oh yay
[14:27] <dano> one of my fav. apps looks like this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamesmp/1672462346/ clean install 7.10

[14:27] <Tomi_G> mendred: i mean, 8.40 and without xserver-xgl
[14:27] <amadeux> Tranto1: don't upgrade, it doesn't work. Make a fresh install
[14:27] <nefasto> hello
[14:27] <void^> Dumptruck: depends on your windows, might require a map (hd2) (hd0) if it was initially installed to the 1st disk
[14:28] <mendred> Tomi_G: ?
[14:28] <h4writer> Does anyone know a window manager using pslop? (if you don't know what pslop is: http://www.daimi.au.dk/~kamstrup/articles/G3-ideas.html)

[14:28] <Tomi_G> mendred sry wrong guy
[14:28] <void^> Dumptruck: you can try these things on grub's command line by the way, just hit C during the boot menu. it features tab completion.
[14:28] <Dumptruck> void^ yes it was but I updated the boot.ini file
[14:28] <whyameye> on resume my wireless doesn't always come back up. How could I force it back up? networkmanager isn't working.
[14:28] <menisk> Tomi_G, sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl

[14:28] <menisk> Tomi_G, Would have helped if you didn't put newest on first. :P
[14:28] <amadeux> this channel needs splitting up...
[14:29] <holx> you mean no options at all?

[14:29] <Tomi_G> menisk: lol :D
[14:29] <Tranto1> thanks amadeux, I will do a fresh install then. But I have to reinstall a lot of things... Someone told me that there is a '-d' option in apt to upgrade, and it worked for him
[14:29] <VSpike> IdleOne: those updates have completed, but the situtation is still the same as before
[14:29] <wow> anybody know how to burn avi into DVD
[14:30] <amadeux> Tranto1: well, it works for some. try if you dare. Did not work for me, and I upgraded an almost vanilla feisty system
[14:30] <steel_lady> compwiz18 I was following instructions on that page that go first to install wine and i am in the proces and it stopped on 99 percent saying that it is waiting for headers and is taking too long
[14:30] <VSpike> wow: if you google, there are some good howtos on the ubuntu forums.  ffmpeg seems to be the tool
[14:30] <compwiz18> steel_lady, what was the command
[14:30] <amadeux> After I upgraded to gutsy, I am experiencing weird issues... For example, if I start the System > Preferences > Appearance app, it always hangs if I try to access anything but the first tab. Is this a known problem?
[14:30] <meoblast001> if i shut down my computer during a distrbution upgrade and start it back up, can i start the upgrade from where i left off?
[14:30] <VSpike> wow: in one, there was even a link to a script to automate the various steps
[14:30] <holx> amadeux: oh wow, thanks
[14:31] <holx> I was usin -o
[14:31] <holx> and never got it to work
[14:31] <donnykey> Damn. Nobody can help me with sound recording?
[14:31] <amadeux> holx: g++ whatever.cpp -o outputfilename also works
=== LjL-Temp is now known as LjL
[14:31] <amadeux> holx or g++ *.cpp -o outputfilename. But use a makefile or similar
[14:31] <VSpike> idleone - however, the crash is now fixed :)

[14:32] <Tranto1> ok, then I won't waste my time. I will have to remember all the things I've done so far to have my sony laptop working. Maybe in Gutsy I won't have to do all these things. Anyone knows if the sony-laptop support has been improved?
[14:32] <finux> Anyone please i'm sorry to keeep on asking but anyone at all got any advice with a frame buffer issue that i'm having

[14:32] <jimmacdonald> Hi Everyone, I am having an odd networking issue. I am unable to use DHCP on my home network after the upgrade. If I set my network connection to IPV4 II it will function and I can do a manual dhclient to get an address but it won't configure automatically. also the connection information selection on Network Manager is greyed out.
[14:32] <jimmacdonald> and if I use DHCP it won't function at all.

[14:37] <zethero1> my wireless have ceased to function with the upgrade of Gutsy
[14:37] <LM22> can anyone here help me :C
[14:37] <ManuP> dmizer, the problem was (i suggest, will test it atm) that the ext3 partition is at the very far end of my HD. all win partitions are at the begining. i now executed fschk /dev/sda1 and told to create a new backup --> so there wont be any differences
[14:37] <zethero1> I have an Atheros card
[14:37] <LjL> LM22: try asking a question :)
[14:37] <zethero1> it was working well with Feisty
[14:37] <Pelo> comatsu, start by checking if it is available in synaptic , much easier, if not  look in here for instructions  http://cutlersoftware.com/ubuntuinstall/
[14:37] <juancis14> ml22: whats your problem?
[14:37] <zethero1> please help...
[14:38] <pwner4once> doesn't 7.10 have a lot of problem with the internet stuff? most people said that it was causuing slow connection and etc

[14:38] <Dumptruck> ?
[14:38] <Tranto1> ok, thanks. So... is there anyone with a Sony Vaio running Gutsy? I have some doubts about brightness level, Fn keys, and so on...

[14:38] <zethero1> anyone?
[14:38] <LM22> I've tried running gksu, and sudo but it doesn't do anything then
[14:38] <dmizer> ManuP: windows won't boot unless it is at the front of the hdd.  so your layout is not unusual.  hope your fix works though.

[14:39] <zethero1> Pelo: it worked out of the box
[14:39] <LjL> uhm LM22, i'm not familiar with nautilus and gnome, but using gksudo to run a command may have unwanted effects. the command will be run with superuser privileges. it may be the opposite of what you want to achieve

[14:39] <Jhs> my screen resolution only goes to 800x600 max, even though the default laptop setting is 1280x800. i'm on an asus f3tc laptop with Nvidia Ge7300 graphics card.
[14:40] <Jhs> what can i do to fix it?
[14:40] <Pelo> zethero1, it's not a question of drivers it's a question of nm applet doing it's job properly and seeing that you have connection it can use
[14:40] <Pelo> Jhs, install nvidia-settings
[14:40] <comatsu> the installation from source guide says to execute a configure script (./configure) but there is no file named configure in the folder with the source

[14:41] <Pelo> zethero1, you'll have to do it one step at a time and not skip anything,  this is trouble shooting, there are no quick fixes , be patient and torough ( however that damn word is speellled)
[14:41] <Jhs> Pelo, i had it installed on 7.04, but ever since i upgraded it hasn't worked (it has only the startup screen, no place to fix settings)

[14:50] <RootyRootRootWoo> Hi, how do I configure compiz, when I hit Visual Effects --> Preferences, noting launches.
[14:50] <LjL> comatsu, then i strongly suggest that you do *not* install it. compile it and have fun with it in any way you want, but please do *not* become root and install it on your system. APT would get upset.    that said, not all programs use 'autoconf' (the thing that gives you ./configure). does it not come with an INSTALL file?
[14:51] <VSpike> which is more efficient - vnc or x11 remotely over ssh with compression?
[14:51] <astro76> VSpike, probably vnc
[14:52] <tuntun> Hi, how can I make objects snap to the edges of the canvas? I have "snap to guides" selected... (forgive me for posting here but the gimp channel is dormant)
[14:52] <stefg> Dumptruck, where is your XP? Are you using wubi? ubuntu and windos are mapped to same partition according to your menu.lst
[14:52] <VSpike> is the krfb protocol compatible with anything else like remote desktop or vnc?
[14:52] <nat_> where is mouse pointer selecton?
[14:52] <Tranto1> agenta: Is that program (sorry, I don't know it) designed for Gnome? Without errors being shown, we can't do much...
[14:52] <Dumptruck> stefg - sorry I changed to hd2,0
[14:52] <comatsu> LjL: why would it be a problem if i installed it? (sorry for the stupid questions but im a total noob)
[14:53] <agenta> it's basically a console programm for setting up vpns easily
[14:53] <agenta> it's quite popular
[14:53] <SuperPigs> is it possible to recover deleted files on ext3?
[14:53] <stefg> Dumptruck, paste output of sudo fdisk -l to pastebin
[14:53] <dano> i'll try reinstalling..
[14:53] <LjL> comatsu, in Ubuntu, everything in the /usr directory is managed by APT. APT assumes that you *never* touch anything in it (except for /usr/local). so if you install stuff on it manually, without using the packages, the system may end up in an unpredictable state.
[14:53] <LjL> SuperPigs: mostly not.
[14:53] <comatsu> apt is aptitude?
[14:54] <tuntun> Hi, how can I make objects snap to the edges of the canvas? I have "snap to guides" selected... (forgive me for posting here but the gimp channel is dormant)
[14:54] <SuperPigs> LjL mostly? yes/no!??
[14:54] <LjL> !apt | comatsu
[14:54] <ubotu> comatsu: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[14:54] <LjL> SuperPigs: what kind of file is that?
[14:54] <Tranto1> agenta: sorry, didn't know it, networking is an unknown world for me
[14:54] <nat_> can't find mouse pointer selection
[14:54] <LjL> comatsu: aptitude, apt-get, synaptic, adept, etc are front-ends to the APT backend
[14:54] <agenta> np, thanks for your help

[14:57] <svg> hi guys - could someone explain me the difference between the alternate and server setup cd?
[14:57] <lamego> svg, the alternate has a text install, but includes the desktop packages
[14:57] <lamego> the server cd, provides server packages
[14:58] <stefg> Dumptruck, all you have to do is change the root for the XP entry to (hd2,0)
[14:58] <HHRy> Hi there everyone
[14:58] <svg> lamego: so if I want to setup a serevr system, say a minimal system, I need the serevr cd? I thought the alternate could also do a minimal install.
[14:58] <RootyRootRootWoo> Hi, how do I configure compiz, when I hit Visual Effects --> Preferences, noting launches.?
[14:58] <Dumptruck> stefg I did but it hangs when trying to boot
[14:58] <lamego> svg, yes it can
[14:58] <tuntun> In gimp, how can I make objects snap to the edges of the canvas? I have "snap to guides" selected... (forgive me for posting here but the gimp channel is dormant)
[14:58] <Dumptruck> do I need to map?
[14:58] <tuntun> Halp!
[14:58] <lamego> svg, but the alternate cd does not come with server packages, like php5, apache2, etc
[14:59] <stefg> Dumptruck, then it's a BIOS or windows issue
[14:59] <HHRy> I was hoping someone here would be able to help me with an issue I"m having; I can't seem to get 7.10 to mount *any* audio CD at all.
[14:59] <svg> lamego: but gose can be installed later on, through the network
[14:59] <lamego> svg, yes, but the point, is, the CD contents
[14:59] <lamego> svg, otherwise you could use a mini cd :)
[14:59] <svg> lamego: ack, thx
[14:59] <simonho_> ＃ubuntu-cn@Freenode
[14:59] <astro76> svg, there is also a minimal cd
[14:59] <astro76> !minimal | svg
[14:59] <Dumptruck> if windows was installed independently - wouldn't I need to map in the menu.lst?
[14:59] <ubotu> svg: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

[15:06] <mc44> LjL: different bug I think
[15:06] <Dumptruck> adop - or you could pm me how it should look?
[15:06] <attunix> Isn't there a live distro where it's a dvd player? you pop in the cd and it plays, but it's linux?
[15:06] <LjL> mc44: there is another that gives a SIGSEGV, but they don't mention crashing
[15:06] <mc44> b0ha, RootyRootRootWoo: try removing all compiz* and libcompiz* packages, removing any third party repos and then reinstalling
[15:06] <attunix> #ubuntu-offtopic
[15:06] <damianl> how do i change the applications menu icon, i have went through configuration editor and changed all the relevant places but nothing happens
[15:07] <Tranto1> Does gutsy use ntfs-3g to access (read/write) NTFS partitions? I have installed this driver in Feisty, and I wonder if I need to upgrade to Gutsy to obtain a better support in NTFS...
[15:07] <RootyRootRootWoo> mc44: ok. I'm doing it now...

[15:07] <m1r0> hello
[15:07] <LiMaO> damianl: that's a nice question.. how to change that ubuntu logo next to the applications menu
[15:07] <Andycasss> Right now it takes about 2 min till it gives up and boots
[15:07] <LiMaO> damianl: let me know if you find it out
[15:07] <muzzbanaan> Hmm, i got really low fps @ Wolfenstein : enemyterritory with FGLRX drivers

[15:08] <muzzbanaan> anyone can help me?
[15:08] <damianl> stefg: yes but how i have tried that also with no luck
[15:08] <linux__alien> I mean people say that Ubuntu is used only for End Users and targeted towards them
[15:08] <SlimeyPete> muzzbanaan: first thing to do is to turn off Desktop Effects (compiz/beryl) if they're turned on
[15:08] <linux__alien> is that so?
[15:08] <^Juan^> i just updated to gutsy but skipped on the remove obsolete packages option; how do i do that now?
[15:09] <SlimeyPete> muzzbanaan: if that doesn't work, google for problems with FGLRX and your graphics hardware
[15:09] <LjL> linux__alien: it tries to be a good end-user experience, but i see no reason why kernel development should be harder to do than in, say, debian
[15:09] <muzzbanaan> SlimeyPete
[15:09] <muzzbanaan> i just removed them both
[15:09] <stefg> muzzbanaan, probably your hardware §D acceleration doesn't work and is done by software emulation. ATI -Card?
[15:09] <muzzbanaan> yea aticard

[15:24] <caner> <AciD> but if it is plugged while computer is booting up it can detect the stick
[15:24] <stefg> Sp0tUb, you don't have to. you can install the feisty kernel in gutsy as well, it might even still be there if you upgraded.

[15:30] <stefg> ShapeshifterO, yeah, i noticed it... wasn't the factoid i expected

[15:43] <LjL> daekdroom: from the RC to the final, yes, there should be some.
[15:43] <picard_pwns_kirk> akos: sorry, but no
[15:43] <xsacha> LjL: oh ok, a dist upgrade
[15:43] <LiMaO> ShapeshifterO: try executing the command from outside the folder.. do not 'cd' to the folder before chroot'ing
[15:44] <drama1981> could using the alternate cd cause display problems after install?
[15:44] <LjL> daekdroom: updates after release will come in due time, don't expect very many very fast.
[15:44] <daekdroom> LjL: i installed RC, and, since 2 days before official release there weren't updates. I thought i had a little apt problem.. =P

[15:52] <nemo_home> I was considering updating to nvidia's display driver 100.14.19 as opposed to the one from May that Gutsy aooears to ship with (1.0-9639)  -  I was wondering, offhand, if this was worth it (issue with black windows when getting a bit too aggressive with compiz) or if Gutsy will likely update shortly anyway
[15:52] <ion_bidon> hello; I have upgraded from dapper to edgy, from edgy to feisty and from feisty to gutsy. Now I have some errors when booting the kernel; the first one is : depmod: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6 cannot open object file: no such file or directory
[15:52] <noo1> jessie^^: be more specific
[15:52] <ShapeshifterO> saloxin: I'll try and reboot now
[15:52] <ion_bidon> and the kernel stops booting
[15:52] <godzirra> jnc: thats it?  Why can I not open a terminal window if my dns is broken? :po
[15:52] <jnc> godzirra: either your hard disk is going bad, or your hostname is not immediately resolvable
[15:52] <stemount> jessie^^, i don't :/
[15:52] <ion_bidon> any ideas how could I fix this ?
[15:52] <LjL> andre: try   gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 437D05B5 ; gpg --export --armor 437D05B5 | sudo apt-key add -
[15:52] <godzirra> My hostname is in /etc/hosts though?
[15:52] <xsacha> LjL: i tried the dist-upgrade and have the same thing by the way...    it is possible there were no updates since the release candidate?
[15:52] <jnc> godzirra: if you run 'xterm' it won't look up your host, so you could use that in a pinch
[15:52] <andre_> LjL: http://pastebin.com/d3c32b21b
[15:52] <LiMaO> nemo_home: that driver update should fix the black screen problems. at least it's reported that way on the forums.
[15:53] <nemo_home> ion_bidon: missing libc is super-bad
[15:53] <jessie^^> noo1, i'm just noticing that my ram usage is highish- system up 18 mins, 711mb ram used
[15:53] <LeRoutier> I'm looking for package testers for swdec & swfdec-mozilla please => http://www.leroutier.net/floss/apt/
[15:53] <LjL> !hostname | godzirra, perhaps you fell for this trap?
[15:53] <ubotu> godzirra, perhaps you fell for this trap?: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly. Alternatively, use the gui at system>administration>networking on the "General" tab

[15:53] <GoingGibbon> I cant upgrade! Cant seem to fix this issue by myself! Does anyone know how to help me? :)
[15:53] <nemo_home> LiMaO: yeah, just wondering if it'll end up being released shortly, in which case I'll wait instead of updating myself
[15:53] <godzirra> jnc: I don't think the hard drive is bad.  Its a new laptop.
[15:53] <LiMaO> nemo_home: but installing something from outside may mess up your ubuntu install, as it's considered a restricted driver
[15:53] <jessie^^> noo1, i've tried it with and without compiz, there doesn't seem to be any issue with compiz-- there's no real drop in ram usage for example if i turn it off
[15:53] <ion_bidon> nemo_home: I'm not missing libc; I can boot with a copied debian kernel & initrd
[15:53] <ShapeshifterO> saloxin: Hehe, yeah recovery mode works :D I guess normal mode will work, too. Thanks a LOT!
[15:53] <LiMaO> nemo_home: i suggest you wait =)
[15:53] <godzirra> LjL: /etc/hosts shows shawn-laptop.  running hostname shows shawn-laptop.  /etc/hostname also has shawn-laptop.
[15:53] <LjL> xsacha: no, i'm pretty sure there *were* updates from the RC... not from the latest dailies, but from the RC, yes. pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[15:54] <noo1> jessie^^: linux tries to use as much ram as possible since unused ram is useless ram
[15:54] <jessie^^> noo1, and i'm trying to decide if this is juts the way things have always been and i just failed to notice till now or if i really do have a problem
[15:54] <godzirra> jnc: and xterm didn't run either.  (this ran fine for hours and hours on feisty)
[15:54] <ion_bidon> nemo_home: I suppose there is something wrong with initrd; how can I examine the initrd ?
[15:54] <nemo_home> LiMaO: yeah, just wondering how long it might be. will it make it into gutsy for example
[15:54] <LjL> andre: try   gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 437D05B5 ; gpg --export --armor 437D05B5 | sudo apt-key add -
[15:54] <mirak> hi
[15:54] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> is there a live cd 7.10 also?
[15:54] <mirak> what is the version of Xorg in gutsy and feisty ?
[15:54] <LjL> andre_: try   gpg --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net --recv-keys 437D05B5 ; gpg --export --armor 437D05B5 | sudo apt-key add -
[15:54] <saloxin> ShapeshifterO: no prob. blkid probes partitiones and gives UUID's if you need them
[15:54] <Genju> heh, autoscripted join, sorry
[15:54] <jessie^^> noo1, yeah but 711 mb used ram when only 284mb is cache ram?
[15:54] <jnc> godzirra: another possibility is that (if you're running Xgl) the composite manager crashed
[15:54] <noo1> jessie^^: 'free -m'   and   'top'   can probably give you some insight
[15:55] <Pirate_Hunter> Is there any linux drivers for the canon i350 printer for gutsy?
[15:55] <godzirra> free -m shows that I've got 1010 total, 804 used, and 205 free.
[15:55] <andre_> LjL:  tx for the help,  I'll see if that work on the next update :)
[15:55] <xsacha> LjL: ok, i havent had any updates since i installed it about 4-5 days ago. here is the sources.list: http://pastebin.ca/744468
[15:55] <nemo_home> LiMaO: would you have any speculation on that front, or should I go poke around, maybe nag a dev or two? :)
[15:55] <godzirra> Hmm... my server load is 8.. but nothing is taking up much memory.  I cant recall how to sort top by CPU
[15:55] <jessie^^> noo1, that's what i'm looking at - 711mb ram used, 290 free, 284mb cached and i'm 20 minutes into startup?
[15:55] <ShapeshifterO> saloxin: I don't really get what UUIDs are good for anyway, they seem to make more problems than anything. I also had to put the /dev/ formatted location for swap into fstab, too so that suspend would work...
[15:55] <noo1> jessie^^: then use top to see what is using it
[15:55] <nemo_home> ion_bidon: no clue on the initrd thing, since I tend to take error messages literally, personally :)
[15:56] <LiMaO> nemo_home: i have no idea on when it'll be gutsy ready.. but it shouldn't take long. lots of people are having problem with compiz
[15:56] <LjL> xsacha: 4-5 days ago? then it might have been a later version than the actual RC. are you sure it was the RC and you didn't get any "immediate" updates when you installed?
[15:56] <l3rutalforce> How to install Avant Window Navigator?/
[15:56] <kua> hello there! I have no sound in vlc or totem player. I have sound i xmms. I use logithech z-10 speakers. so i have no soundcard installed. I have disabeld the soundcard i the bios. Have also installed gstreamer. anyone that can help me?
[15:56] <jessie^^> godzirra, < and  > to move the sort field
[15:56] <nemo_home> LiMaO: good times. I mean, this graphics card has a half-gig of memory...
[15:56] <saloxin> ShapeshifterO: UUID's are ment to help us change from /dev/hda to /dev/sda. didn't work for me, but I think it work for quite a lot of ubuntu users
[15:56] <godzirra> jnc: how do I tell if thats the case?
[15:56] <nemo_home> LiMaO: fortunately I only notice it when I push things a bit
[15:56] <LjL> xsacha: sources.list seems ok
[15:56] <nemo_home> LiMaO: I'm sure the average user would be rather unhappy.
=== steve__ is now known as spideyman
[15:56] <drama1981> could using the alternate cd cause display probs after install? i get sync warnings from my monitor at each boot. was fine in fiesty no probs at all. untill i installed gutsy
[15:56] <jnc> godzirra: I don't know much about the Xgl stuff, my hardware is never that nice
[15:57] <godzirra> jessie^^: I've got jessie highlighted and I keep answering things directed at you ;)
[15:57] <Pirate_Hunter> jessie^^: youre not the only one having weird ram amounts, i have no clue why but for some reason on start i ran up to 300mb of ram
[15:57] <xsacha> LjL: i got some immediate updates.. but it was just after RC was released (maybe the next day)
[15:57] <Pirate_Hunter> Is there any linux drivers for the canon i350 printer for gutsy?
[15:57] <jessie^^> Pirate_Hunter, do you think this is anything to worry about?
[15:57] <mc44> nemo_home: er gutsy has 100.14.19
[15:57] <jnc> Pirate_Hunter: shared ram?   some integrated graphics cards share memory with the system
[15:57] <LiMaO> nemo_home: yeah they are.. people are saying such bad things about ubuntu just because of this gutsy release with the fancy effects and stuff =P
[15:57] <nemo_home> mc44: not my gutsy
[15:57] <LjL> xsacha: give me the output of     apt-cache policy tzdata     (that package was updated recently)
[15:57] <nemo_home> mc44: unless this nvidia tool is lying to me
[15:57] <mc44> nemo_home: apt-cache policy nvidia-glx-new
[15:57] <godzirra> So anyone know how I would check to see if the Xgl something crashed?  Because I can't run anything from the command line that  takes sudo, or pretty much anything in X
[15:58] <nemo_home> mc44: hm. well, my bad?
[15:58] <jnc> godzirra: that really sounds like a network problem though
[15:58] <Mendo> Ok one more.. how is the best way to install the lamp server on the ubuntu desktop?
[15:58] <nemo_home> wth
[15:58] <oriez> where can i get the Ubuntu 7.10 DVD?
[15:58] <noo1> !lamp > Mendo
[15:58] <LjL> !lamp > Mendo    (Mendo, see the private message from Ubotu)
[15:58] <xsacha> jessie^^: 427mb of ram being used? thats quite a lot :O i had 180 in kubuntu feisty
[15:58] <godzirra> jnc: Well, my wireless disconnected... but why would my wireless getting disconnected cause my whole system to stop working?
[15:58] <jisatsu> with imagemagick import (to take screenshots), is there any way to tell it to save as png without specifying png as the filename? I want to output to stdout
[15:58] <jnc> godzirra: because it's *nix.
[15:58] <ben___> The version of Gutsy on torrentspy.com is official, ie. genuine, right? Thousands of people are seeding it already
[15:59] <noo1> oriez: cdimages.ubuntu.com
[15:59] <LjL> xsacha, jessie^^: the amount of used RAM, as seen in "top" or "free", doesn't mean much of anything.
[15:59] <mc44> !torrents > ben___
[15:59] <godzirra> jnc: it never did that before on feisty, even when my network got disconnected.
[15:59] <cantona> $ ekiga
[15:59] <nemo_home> mc44: the nvidia settings tool claims 1.0-9639
[15:59] <cantona> ekiga: error while loading shared libraries: libssl3.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[15:59] <jessie^^> LjL, prease to exprain
[15:59] <dreamwalker> Has anyone problem with games yo run in fulscreen after installing compiz in 7.10?
[15:59] <jnc> godzirra: privmsg me, we'll walk through and fix your stuffs
[15:59] <cantona> after upgrade to gutsy
[15:59] <godzirra> Sure.
[15:59] <stemount> dreamwalker, i play q3 fine
[15:59] <stemount> with compiz
[15:59] <nemo_home> mc44: oh-hoh. which is an IA32 driver according to http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_archive.html
[15:59] <xsacha> LjL: apt-cache policy tzdata  gives me 2007f-3ubuntu1 for Candidate and Installed
[15:59] <nemo_home> well bugger
[15:59] <ben___> cheers
[16:00] <Pirate_Hunter> jessie^^: i do woorry about it 300mb is over the top for me especially since Feisty never took that much for me max ram on startup would be 200mb not 376mb
[16:00] <LjL> jessie^^: Linux caches files quite aggressively. if you open a file, it keeps it cached (i.e. in RAM) as long as it can. the amount of used/free memory shown by commands such as "free" reflect that.  but that RAM will be released as soon as any program needs it.
[16:00] <noo1> oriez: http://cdimages.ubuntu.com/non-ports/releases/7.10/release/ to be more specific
[16:00] <saloxin> ben___: check the md5sum after downloading
[16:00] <cantona> gutsy sucks
[16:00] <nemo_home> mc44: I presume I could just use the x86 driver?
[16:00] <ben___> :)
[16:00] <LjL> xsacha: uhm, there is 2007h-0ubuntu0.7.10 in gutsy-updates
[16:00] <jessie^^> LjL, the system monitor applet says: 38% in use by programs, 33% as cache
[16:00] <mc44> nemo_home: if you used the restricted driver manager it should have installed the correct one
[16:00] <Pirate_Hunter> jnc: yeha my graphics card built into the mobo takes ram but still its way too much especially on startup
[16:00] <oriez> nool - thank u but this page doesnt load up
[16:00] <xsacha> LjL: so im missing something?
[16:00] <nemo_home> mc44: keep in mind I bought this ubuntu box from dell to encourage their business decision :)
[16:01] <jessie^^> LjL, and yet when i go into top, i can't account for 38% of my ram
[16:01] <xsacha> jessie^^: how much is buffers though
[16:01] <nemo_home> mc44: perhaps they mucked with things in feisty...
[16:01] <mc44> nemo_home: if you have an older card, only 9369 is supported by nvidia
[16:01] <nemo_home> GeForce 7300 LE
[16:01] <saloxin> Pirate_Hunter: linux uses as much memory as possible to cache files, thereby avoiding fileacess. all memory should be used - thats the idea
[16:01] <jessie^^> xsacha, may i pm?
[16:01] <xsacha> jessie^^: i have 763MB used, 28MB buffers, 340MB cached
[16:01] <LjL> xsacha: *i* am missing something, for sure. your sources.list has gutsy-updates enabled, and yet you aren't getting those updates.
[16:02] <Mendo> the lamp message you sent me is that up todate with 7.10?
[16:02] <LjL> xsacha: try temporarily removing the "au." from your mirrors... perhaps the australian mirrors are having problems?
[16:02] <_supernva__> hi everyone, i'm having troubles with btb878 tv card, anyone can help
[16:02] <noo1> Mendo: should be very similar if it is not...
[16:02] <mc44> nemo_home: hmm you should be able to use the newer driver
[16:02] <nemo_home> saloxin: btw, Microsoft finally caught up to that game in Vista. only for them it is revolutionary ;)
[16:02] <LjL> xsacha: remove also the first line (the CD line), you won't probably need that and it will just be a nuisance
[16:02] <nemo_home> mc44: hm. well, I'll see if I can get it installed then
[16:03] <xsacha> LjL: hang on, im getting a tonne of 'Ign[ored]' when updating.. ill pastebin
[16:03] <Pirate_Hunter> saloxin: 0_o dont get that concept isnt that an awful way to manage ram?
[16:03] <nemo_home> mc44: will poke around with package manager
[16:03] <LjL> xsacha: yes, thanks
[16:03] <Op3r> How can you optimize Gutsy ?
[16:03] <LjL> Op3r: define "optimize"
[16:03] <nemo_home> Pirate_Hunter: no, it is a great way to manage ram. :-p
[16:03] <TheMafia> is libmysql++-dev the dev files for mysql-server ?
[16:03] <nemo_home> Pirate_Hunter: why wouldn't you want unused ram doing something useful?
[16:03] <Op3r> LjL, squeezing more performance?
[16:03] <mc44> nemo_home: uninstall nvidia-glx, install nvidia-glx-new, run sudo nvidia-xconfig
[16:03] <MasterShrek> Op3r, compile a cudtom kernel
[16:03] <mc44> nemo_home: and reboot
[16:03] <vocx> Attention all users: there is a new subforum on virtualization in ubuntuforums.org   The sticky has a lot of useful information to get you started. Personally I think VirtualBox is really easy for the novice, and is smaller than VMWare Server.
[16:03] <nemo_home> mc44: aight
[16:03] <Op3r> yay
[16:03] <Op3r> :(
[16:03] <saloxin> Pirate_Hunter: hehe. the ram is powered on and idling, might as well put it to good use
[16:03] <LjL> Op3r, why do you think that Gutsy, by default, is designed so as to give you sub-optimal performance?
[16:04] <mnemo> I would like to share a folder on my ubuntu machine so that my windows machine can access that folder... I just followed the instructions in this screencast, but I can't get it to work... when open the share from windows and specify my ubuntu login it says "access denied" ... any ideas?
[16:04] <nemo_home> mc44: heh. reboot or exit X, unload/reload module :-p
[16:04] <jdong> Op3r: is there any aspect of the base system performance that displeases you?
[16:04] <jessie^^> xsacha, incoming four line paste for you

[16:06] <nitalaut> hello guys
[16:06]  * nemo_home is happy
[16:06] <xsacha> stemount: KDE uses less RAM for me?
[16:06] <jdong> MasterShrek: I mean it helps with audio latency and other forms of instant response-times, but overall a -rt kernel is slower than a standard one in the big picture
[16:06] <MasterShrek> jdong, i dont know, i think a low-latency kernel is better
[16:06] <LjL> MasterShrek: KDE is smaller...?
[16:06] <stemount> hmmm GNOME uses much less for me
[16:06]  * nemo_home practices his kanji on the screen with the compiz fire plugin
[16:06] <nitalaut> my ubuntu 7.10 hangs while booting with nvidia fx5200
[16:07] <jdong> LjL: it's kind of true -- a kde install without all that stuff kubuntu turns on by default uses around 60MB RAM
[16:07] <nitalaut> it boots fine with integradetd video
[16:07] <xsacha> stemount: gnome is using 400MB for me and kde uses 180MB when im using kubuntu
[16:07] <MasterShrek> LjL, i think so, maybe not a whole lot tho
[16:07] <Psi-Jack> OKay. I'm having complications playing DVD's in Totem on Ubuntu 7.10. Using the gstreamer plug. Anyone know how to fix this, save for going to xine?
[16:07] <kanzie> After upgrading I have the problem of windows loosing their topbar so I cant move them or close them (unless using the keyboard), before I had Beryl and could just reload the window manager with a click in the menu, but now its integrated in the OS and I dont know what to do to get the "window" back...
=== menisk is now known as Menisk
[16:07] <kanzie> any ideas?
[16:07] <xsacha> jessie^^: i have same memory usage as you
[16:07] <stemount> xsacha, thats because you have gnome libraries loaded too i guess?
[16:07] <nemo_home> jdong: XFCE4 :)
[16:07] <xsacha> stemount: how do i not have gnome libraries?
[16:07] <nemo_home> jdong: my laptop with 96MiB of memory runs XFCE4 :)
[16:07] <LjL> xsacha: uhm there are some igns but i'm not sure that should be an issue itself
[16:07] <nemo_home> jdong: uses GTK, but not gnome
[16:07] <jdong> nemo_home: that's an option too; but IMO after DT_GNU_HASH in Feisty KDE is significantly faster than XFCE4 on old hardware....
[16:08] <Op3r> for those who are having problems with upgrading to gutsy, upgrade your system first then it will prompt you to upgrade to gutsy
[16:08] <jessie^^> xsacha, so the buffers line is really what i should be looking at to determine actual memory used?
[16:08] <stemount> xsacha, KDE was 300mb+ compared to gnome 150mb :/
[16:08] <jdong> nemo_home: of course, if you like GNOME apps.... KDE is pretty useless :)
[16:08] <nemo_home> jdong: looking to cut down on memory consumption
[16:08] <jdong> stemount: whoa, KDE is 300mb+??
[16:08] <nemo_home> KDE and GNOME are both memory hogs in their own way
[16:08] <xsacha> jessie^^: total used - buffers - cached ?
[16:08] <stemount> yeah jdong, was for me...
[16:08] <noo1> the partition table on one of my drives got wiped.  Other than things like testdisk and gpart, does anyone have any suggestions on how I cat get at my data?
[16:08] <nemo_home> jdong: well, fact is, simply more apps I like are GTK based. on 96MiB of memory didn't want to load both Qt and GTK
[16:08] <nemo_home> jdong: so I picked one
[16:08] <xsacha> stemount: what did you have to do?
[16:08] <jessie^^> xsacha, total minus buffers minus cached?
[16:08] <nemo_home> jdong: XFCE4 can apparently use Qt too
[16:08] <stemount> Don't know if its the same for 7.10 jdong
[16:08] <jdong> nemo_home: if you use majority GTK apps, I would never tell you to try KDE :)
[16:08] <saloxin> my perf tip: mount / with noatime. breaks only 1% of applications (mutt :-( )
[16:08] <xsacha> jessie^^: yes
[16:08] <stemount> xsacha, ?
[16:08] <jessie^^> xsacha, thank you
[16:09] <nemo_home> jdong: heh. I have one KDE machine too.
[16:09] <xsacha> stemount: to get gnome down to 150
[16:09] <kua> hello there! I have no sound in vlc or totem player. I have sound i xmms. I use logithech z-10  usb speakers. so i have no soundcard installed. I have disabeld the soundcard i the bios. Have also installed gstreamer. anyone that can help me?
[16:09] <jdong> stemount: I've ran minimal no-startup-items KDE on a 128MB lappy before
[16:09] <jdong> stemount: it worked totally fine, faster than GNOME, on par with XFCE4 except faster window opening
[16:09] <nemo_home> jdong: pity the Qt Moz project died.  Still quite a few shortcomings in Konqueror
[16:09] <tekteen> anyone know how to put an icon on the desktop on the Live cd
[16:09] <xsacha> stemount: i have 400mb under gnome right now. all i have running is pidgin, firefox, compiz and AWN
[16:09] <jdong> stemount: KDE can be a SERIOUS net win if you use all KDE apps
[16:09] <s1a1h1i1l1> hey
[16:09] <xsacha> yeah i only ever used all KDE apps
[16:09] <Draggin> Ola! I need some assistance with MySQL, PHP and Apache in Ubuntu... For some reason, almost none of them seem to be listed in the Add/Remove utility.  In Synaptic however, there are so many, that I don't know which packages to install... I want a standard installation of all of these packages, so which do I choose?
[16:10] <jdong> stemount: if you load GNOME and start Firefox, it uses another 50MB RAM. If you load KDE and start Konqueror, it uses like 500KB extra.
[16:10] <nemo_home> jdong: now the one KDE app that wins, hands down.  k3b.
[16:10] <stemount> I'm talking idle gnome is 150mb
[16:10] <kanzie> After upgrading I have the problem of windows loosing their topbar so I cant move them or close them (unless using the keyboard), before I had Beryl and could just reload the window manager with a click in the menu, but now its integrated in the OS and I dont know what to do to get the "window" back...
[16:10] <xsacha> 180MB usage with kaffeine, konsole, konqueror and konversation running
[16:10] <s1a1h1i1l1> do any of u have an acer laptop (aspire 3000 series)
[16:10] <noo1> !lamp > Draggin
[16:10] <s1a1h1i1l1> ?
[16:10] <xsacha> nemo_home: for me, it's kaffeine. i cant find any program that plays tv as good as kaffeine
[16:10] <stemount> s1a1h1i1l1, have setup a 3000 series before for a friend
[16:10] <nemo_home> actually, since the kde/gnome argument is running right now. does gnome finally have a non-sucky CD burner?
[16:10] <jessie^^> nemo_home, yes
[16:10] <Draggin> noo1 - Sorry, what?
[16:10] <nemo_home> xsacha: I really don't use my TV card much
[16:10] <nemo_home> well, at all
[16:11] <xsacha> this computer is also my tv, so yeah important for me
[16:11] <nemo_home> xsacha: when I did, even under KDE I used, oh, tvtime? something like that
[16:11] <xsacha> eww tvtime.. it's as bad as mplayer
=== Simon__ is now known as simm
[16:11] <noo1> Draggin: read the private message ubotu sent you.  It contains a link with the information you seek
[16:11] <nemo_home> jessie^^: really? which one do you recommend?
[16:11] <nemo_home> xsacha: I love mplayer too
[16:11] <jdong> xsacha: what's bad about mplayer? I like it!
[16:11] <wers> when I configured my network manually, network manager stopped managing my network. any ideas?
[16:11] <nemo_home> xsacha: and mencoder
[16:11] <Op3r> vlc all the way
[16:11] <jessie^^> xsacha, the resulting number is 423mb. will that number ever go down?
[16:11] <Draggin> noo1 - Aha :) Thanks very much
[16:11] <xsacha> nemo_home: it's a pain to change channels and configure and looks ugly
[16:11] <jessie^^> nemo_home, i use the builtin one sweetie
[16:11] <fleep> Hi:  I am trying my first ubuntu installation on my new box (amd64 dual core opteron and new SATA drive).  When I get to the part where ubuntu tries to start an Xsession, it fails with the message "your session lasted only less than 10sec"  it mentions that I may be out of diskspace.  I loaded the failsafe terminal and ran parted to label and partition my disk, but it still fails with the same message.  Can anyone help me get this install back on t
[16:12] <xsacha> jessie^^: i guess this 400mb usage is a new ubuntu gutsy thing
[16:12] <jdong> xsacha: maybe it's my *nix geekiness, but mplayer is a swiss army knife of media
[16:12] <vocx> nemo_home, xsacha jessie^^ jdong I think you all are offtopic with the KDE/Gnome discussion... LjL?
[16:12] <nemo_home> jessie^^: ah. so does the nautilus burner finally burn CD images?
[16:12] <xsacha> jdong: kaffeine for tv and movies for me
[16:12] <nemo_home> jessie^^: and have actual advanced settings menu?
[16:12] <mikubuntu> vinze, sorry so long: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41532/
[16:12] <nemo_home> jessie^^: or is it still just for drag n drop file burning?
[16:12] <jessie^^> vocx, we're discussing memory usage.
[16:12] <xsacha> jdong: try changing tv channels on mplayer or resizing the window or setting up schedules and go running back to kaffeine :\
[16:12] <mboso_> I have installed the new nvidia beta drivers but X fails to start unless i first rmmod the nvidia kernel module. why is this? how can I make X start the frist time correctly?
[16:12] <nemo_home> vocx: and I'm looking for a decent high-powered gnome burning tool :)
[16:12] <noo1> yes, please move the kde and media player discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
[16:12] <nemo_home> vocx: any recommendations? :D
[16:12] <jdong> xsacha: ok, point. that's not the intended purpose of mplayer :)
[16:13] <tekteen> anyone know how to change files in the home folder of the livecd user?
[16:13] <tekteen> before burning
[16:13] <jessie^^> xsacha, well fwiw i had the machine running all day and never hit swap so i guess i'm ok.
[16:13] <xsacha> jdong: dont think it was for kaffeine either, but it's in there.. cant find anything like it on gnome
[16:13] <xsacha> thats why i have to load kaffeine up and that just makes this gutsy ram usage go out the window
[16:13] <vocx> nemo_home, xsacha jessie^^ jdong well as long as you keep it like support and not "this is better than that" it's okay
[16:13] <OldPink> Guys, check it out, one of the huge supermarkets in the UK has started stocking Ubuntu Dapper systems: http://direct.tesco.com/search/default.aspx?search=linux&confirm.x=0&confirm.y=0
[16:13] <jessie^^> xsacha, it doesn't appear to be compiz doing it either, which is good :)
[16:13] <stefg> tekteen, not possible without doing a complete remaster
[16:13] <jdong> xsacha / jessie^^: btw, GNOME stock should not be 400MB RAM in Gutsy, I've been up for 3 days running compiz and firefoxes, and I'm only at 396
[16:14] <jessie^^> vocx, i'm not here to start a dick size war honey
[16:14] <tekteen> ok
[16:14] <tekteen> I am at that stage already
[16:14] <vocx> !language > jessie^^
[16:14] <xsacha> jessie^^: yeah for me compiz only used 4MB of RAM.. thats not the hog, but checkout Xorg memory usage (this is related to compiz!!!)
[16:14] <mc44> jdong: xgl/firefox usually take me above that after a while :(
[16:14] <tekteen> the home folder is generated at boot
[16:14] <felipe__> COuld someone help me with a critical temperature reached on  Gusty?? the desktop pc keeps turning off
[16:14] <jessie^^> xsacha, 9mb
[16:14] <stemount> Compiz is about 50mb!
[16:14] <jdong> mc44: Xgl leaks. badly. sad, no?
[16:14] <tekteen> but from where?
[16:14] <GoingGibbon> I cant upgrade! Package not trusted:
[16:14] <GoingGibbon> ERROR pre-requists item 'http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/release-upgrader-dpkg/release-upgrader-dpkg_1.14.5ubuntu11.2_i386.udeb' is NOT trusted
[16:14] <saloxin> felipe__: fans running ok?
[16:14] <jdong> stemount: Compiz RAM usage is factored into your base X server
[16:14] <mc44> jdong: but soon it will be ding dong dead! :)
[16:14] <fleep> can anyone help me get past the "your session lasted less than 10seconds" message I am getting when trying to install ubuntu on a new box?
[16:14] <GoingGibbon> How do I fix this?
[16:14] <simm> lo all - trying to turn my laptop into a media centre, I have a 1366*768 TV with s-video in, and my laptop has s-video out on an nvidia graphics car, but I can't seem to get the s-video output to line up nicely with the TV
[16:15] <xsacha> and the RAM usage also depends on aiglx / nvidia / xgl
[16:15] <jdong> mc44: let's hope so :)
[16:15] <stemount> yeah
[16:15] <felipe__> saloxin: yeah, pretty noisy :)
[16:15] <xsacha> i think aiglx gives more ram usage
[16:15] <simm> any suggestions?
[16:15] <saloxin> felipe__: no overclocking in bios?
[16:15] <AciD> have you ever heard about a compiz-tray-icon which simply doesn't show up ? If yes do you know how to solve this ?
[16:15] <felipe__> saloxin: right now I booted with the acpi=off option so far it hast turned off, but I dont want to melt my processor
[16:15] <jdong> jessie^^ / xsacha: also, don't read the RAM free counters like the law.... those are just estimates -- in modern OS'es it's extremely difficult to accurately portray memory utilization
[16:15] <stemount> 7.04 was really good on RAM usage
[16:15] <fleep> hi filipe, i'm fleep :P
[16:16] <stefg> !pm | tekteen
[16:16] <ubotu> tekteen: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit AND help you. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first, some find it rude.
[16:16] <xsacha> jdong: i just use RES-SHR from top
[16:16] <felipe__> fleep: hi :P
[16:16] <stemount> lol.. everybody is welcome to #ubuntu-stemount for individual help ;)
[16:16] <l3rutalforce> how i configure my nvidia settings
[16:16] <l3rutalforce> how i configure my nvidia settings for resolutions?
[16:16] <jessie^^> jdong, i am trying to determine tho if i have a memory leak
[16:16] <saloxin> felipe__: releasenotes mention a dell that gets fans turned off. so gutsy might be involved in the problem.
[16:16] <tomd123> stemount
[16:16] <l3rutalforce> sudo nvidia settings?
[16:17] <xsacha> stemount: i agree, i think it's just gutsy. ram usage doubled here?
[16:17] <Op3r> whats the difference between gtk theme and metacity theme?
[16:17] <felipe__> saloxin: I bet is a software issue and not a hardware issue.
[16:17] <stemount> xsacha, same..
[16:17] <stemount> :)
[16:17] <jessie^^> xsacha, yeah, if it's 'just gutsy', then well i guess i'll live with it
[16:17] <stemount> :(*
[16:17] <tomd123> stemount: are you familiar with enabling programmable buttons on a laptop (vaio)
[16:17] <stemount> yep
[16:17] <xsacha> Op3r: metacity is the window borders, gtk is the inside of the window
[16:17] <killaz> I have some problem with my new dvdwriter .... I still cant browse a DVD data disk with it..
[16:17] <Adoleleo_> How do i remove the ->Documents, Music, Pictures, en Videos maps out of gutsy don't want them
[16:17] <stemount> come to #ubuntu-stemount tomd123
[16:17] <Op3r> thanks
[16:18] <killaz> I just inserted a DVD data with AVI files on it. On my laptop with ubuntu I can see the files but not on the pc with the new DVD writer device.
[16:18] <killaz> It's a SATA DVD writer..
[16:19] <Flodo> test
[16:19] <felipe__> saloxin: well the pc hasnt turned off so far, how do I make it so it automatically boots up with the acpi=off option?
[16:19] <mc44> Adoleleo_: just delete the folder?
[16:19] <killaz> what could be the problem here? If you need more information I'll be glad to give.....
=== Tstnz is now known as pizzicato`
[16:19] <stemount> xsacha, It doesn't bother me Gutsy has double RAM. It never touches past 400mb RAM
[16:19] <Adoleleo_> yeh but they come back then
[16:19] <stemount> I have 1gig stick
[16:19] <kanzie> I upgraded to Gutsy and now the top of the windows is gone? what can I do?
[16:19] <Flodo> Yay!! Pocketpc with irc rawkz! -_-
[16:19] <asbani> what do i need to install to be able to view .wmv files
[16:19] <pwner4once> window media player!
[16:20] <killaz> this is my fstab for the cd-rom and dvd-writer:
[16:20] <xsacha> stemount: doesnt really bother me since using 500mb of cache never helped me much
[16:20] <killaz> /dev/scd1       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0

[16:20] <noo1> !restricted > asbani
[16:20] <fleep> flodo-what IRC client are you using?
[16:20] <ragan> I think there is a plugin available for wmv files
[16:20] <Altk> hey, I just upgrade from FF to 7.10 GG and when it boots all I see is the cursor that spins around endlessly.
[16:20] <asbani> pwner4once: no in linux, i remember i could view it with vlc, but what kind of codec do i need to install
[16:20] <Flodo> zsirc =)
[16:20] <fleep> hi flodo, I'm fleep and over there is filipe :P
[16:20] <stemount> xchat FTW
[16:20] <jessie^^> xsacha, stemount: thank you for looking at this with me. i guess this is a 'just gutsy' thing :)
[16:20] <killaz> jessie^^: thought for those two lines it wasn't necessary..
[16:20] <Flodo> lol
[16:20] <fleep> we need some more flaflas here :P
[16:20] <stemount> yeah I believe so
[16:20] <jessie^^> killaz, i got yelled at for doing 3lines :P
[16:21] <stemount> I can't see Compiz helping though, I have like all the features enabled :P
[16:21] <killaz> not 2 :-P
=== Bur3k is now known as hacktivi
[16:21] <stemount> that don't conflict with anything else :)
[16:21] <xsacha> jessie^^: it was 4 :P
[16:21] <Flodo> brb
[16:21] <arbutus> Can I do a dist upgrade from Feisty to Gutsy using the LiveCD?  I see instructions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades that tell how to do it with the Alternate CD, but I see no mention of the LiveCD.
[16:21] <kanzie> where can I change to the cube for desktops in Gutsy
[16:21] <mundungus> has any one here olready using gutsy?
[16:21] <stamco> hello
[16:21] <stemount> I am mundungus
[16:21] <jessie^^> stemount, i just left the compiz settings where they were. turning it off didn't result in a drop in memory....
[16:21] <garu> hi everyone
[16:21] <Beefheart> Hello, anyone here using 7.10 and a i915gm display adapter on laptop ?
[16:21] <mundungus> i would like to know wat are the new features they have added that are nice
[16:21] <jessie^^> acually, i'm gonna try something.
[16:21] <saloxin> feldari_: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add it to your kernel line
[16:22] <mundungus> stemont,how is it?
[16:22] <dudeicles> I have an install (Grapevine) that won't finish. And now every time I upgrade it messes up because this program won't install correctly.
[16:22] <mirak> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41536/   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41535/  I have a problem with gutsy Xorg that I didn't had with feisty
[16:22] <xsacha> jessie^^: yeah it's more on video ram. but if you use aiglx it should take off about 20-40MB im sure
[16:22] <mundungus> me astil dloading it,cud finally get tomorrow
[16:22] <jamviking> hi everyone
[16:22] <saloxin> felipe__: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add it to your kernel line
[16:22] <xsacha> off of Xorg
[16:22] <stemount> it is very good mundungus :)
[16:22] <dudeicles> is there a way to delete that install from happening again?
[16:22] <albech> I'm in love with my new Ubuntu :D
[16:22] <thesaint> how do i rar a file in Linux
[16:22] <stemount> mundungus, bit heavy on memory but :)
[16:22] <stemount> its excellent
[16:22] <garu> picard_pwns_kirk godzirra how do I reinstall GRUB, in case something goes wrong when I'm trying to add something to it?
[16:22] <killaz> anyone knows of any reason why I can't see the data on the disk?
[16:23] <noo1> the partition table on one of my drives got wiped.  Other than things like testdisk and gpart, does anyone have any suggestions on how I cat get at my data?
[16:23] <thesaint> how do i rar a file in Linux
[16:23] <xsacha> thesaint: you mean tar?
[16:23] <mundungus> stemont,how is the wireless capability of it,the one for fiesty gives me headaches to configure
[16:23] <noo1> !rar > thesaint
[16:23] <fleep> I'm trying to install 7.1(i think that's gutsy) and I just get BS errors.  I'm about to dump this OS and try it again in a few weeks when they work the bugs out of 10.1   this is BS
[16:23] <mundungus> Oow!
[16:23] <thesaint> like Winrar
[16:23] <albech> thesaint: you need rar or just compression?
[16:23] <Beefheart> First of all I got a question regarding driver rollback. Is there a way to roll back you display settings (drivers xorg.conf) to the way they where after fresh upgrade to 7.10 ?
[16:23] <noo1> thesaint: see the private message from ubotu
[16:23] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: use the alterate install disk, and select the recovery option at the boot menu
[16:23] <mOrO^> fleep, is that you??
[16:23] <mundungus> then i shud be looking for xubuntu gutsy! :-)
[16:23] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: or make a copy of your menu.lst
[16:23] <fleep> m0r0-do I know you?
[16:24] <stemount> Xubuntu 7.10 is really nice!
[16:24] <mOrO^> fleep, from newsgarden?
[16:24] <stemount> works fine on my 192mb 1.0ghz laptop i have
[16:24] <fleep> nope...not me
[16:24] <noo1> fleep: do something useful like pastebinning the errors instead of whining
[16:24] <mOrO^> fleep, sorry
[16:24] <mundungus> stemount,xu... are usually for low specs yeah?
[16:24] <Beefheart> anyone ?
[16:24] <Altk> hey, I just upgrade from FF to 7.10 GG and when it boots all I see is the cursor that spins around endlessly. Any ideas?
[16:24] <xsacha> thesaint: you could use unrar-free to unrar files. or use winrar through wine. if you just want to compress stuff, you can just use the archiver / tar
[16:24] <garu> picard_pwns_kirk I'v got a copy of it.if I dont have the alternate install disk, can I use the normal livecd to do the recovery?
[16:25] <mundungus> stemount,me running a fiesty on 512 ram and it works soo fine!
[16:25] <noo1> fleep: "BS errors" is an incredibly useless description of the problem if you actually want help
[16:25] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: I don't think so
[16:25] <xsacha> mundungus: gutsy doesnt like the 512 though?
[16:25] <thesaint> thanks..
[16:25] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: a backup is usually the best way to go
[16:25] <Beefheart> I got a question regarding driver rollback. Is there a way to roll back you display settings (drivers xorg.conf) to the way they where after fresh upgrade to 7.10 ?
[16:25] <thesaint> Dose anyone know how i can hack With Bluetooth?
[16:25] <xsacha> mundungus: not surprising seeing as it uses up 400MB here. wonder why the RAM doubled exactly
[16:25] <vdox> hi, how can i make gutsy recognize my usb hub attached to my laptop?
[16:25] <mundungus> would xubuntu gutsy run well on 512 then?
[16:26] <picard_pwns_kirk> thesaint: hacking is bad, don't do it
[16:26] <xsacha> mundungus: for sure, even kde should
[16:26] <noo1> mundungus: very
[16:26] <garu> picard_pwns_kirk with the menu.ls copy, how do I go about recovering it?can I do it with the livecd?
[16:26] <stemount> Hi - does anyone know how to make custom keyboard shortcuts?
[16:26] <thesaint> I know its bad
[16:26] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: yes, you can
[16:26] <thesaint> but i wana test on my own phone
[16:26] <vocx>  Attention all users: there is a new subforum on virtualization in ubuntuforums.org   The sticky has a lot of useful information to get you started. Remember there are two versions of VirtualBox, one with USB support and one without. Which one are you using?
[16:26] <thesaint> no one elses
[16:26] <wers> when I configured my network manually, network manager stopped managing my network. any ideas?
[16:26] <stemount> mundungus, UBuntu would be fine with 512mb ram
[16:26] <loco_aullador> hi i have the ubuntu 7.04 and i want to upgrade it to the 7.10, could this upgrade cause problems? i mean will the 7.10 work as well as a complete install?

[16:32] <picard_pwns_kirk> garu: if you're looking for a quick fix, install another version of Ubuntu on a partition, and hopefully it'll detect it
[16:32] <xNibbler> lior, what have you tried so far? there is a redirect target, isnt it?
[16:33] <lior> my setup is latop(10.0.0.x) -> server 10.0.0.1 -> voip allinone gizmo that holds the dev.linnovate.net ip
[16:33] <stemount> Beefheart, do you have a problem installing with a 915?
[16:33] <lior> I control sever 10.0.0.1
[16:33] <vocx> noo1, I've heard you may use fdisk to do that, but I have no real experience.
[16:33] <lior> myisp controls the voip box.
[16:33] <lior> I'm a total newbie in iptables
[16:33] <garu> picard_pwns_kirk thanks!Wouldnt mind if there was a command to reinstall GRUB, like the one to reinstall Gnome!lol
[16:33] <Beefheart> stemount, yes, kinda it worked when i installed, then i tryed to change driver to see if it got better, now i cant get back my old settings. im new to linux. kinda
[16:33] <lior> So I really tried several rusn which gave me syntax errors.
[16:33] <Psi-Jack> Okay. Has /anyone/ here ever successfully gotten Totem with gstreamer to play Surround Sound output at all?
[16:34]  * jnc officially announces "I am sick of people complaining ... BUT IT WORKED IN X.Y.Z!?!?"

[16:34] <lior> I couldn't put together anything ... :(
[16:34] <vocx> garu, there is a command to reinstall grub, called "grub-install"
[16:34] <attunix> jnc: it's ok. take deep breaths....
[16:34] <jnc> It's broken, you're here. Get on with it.
[16:34] <stemount> Beefheart, why did it kinda work?
[16:34]  * jnc hyperventilates
[16:34] <attunix> jnc: slowly! :P
[16:34] <garu> vocx how do I do that?is it like sudo apt-get grub-install?

[16:35] <noo1> vocx: thanks
[16:35] <addicted68098> I am having trouble with the file browser on 7.10 , for some reason it seems to be in full screen (which I don't even think is an option) Does anyone know how to the file browser out of full screen?
[16:35] <I-hate-xp> about the open source driver, is ATI working better than Nvidia?? anybody suggests?
[16:35] <Beefheart> stemount, and i think ive tryed all options in that tool to change back now. nothing

[16:35] <mundungus> i wud like to ask,how well is wireless supported on gutsy for those who use wireless networks?
[16:35] <TheSaint> dose anyone know how to hack?
[16:35] <mundungus> fiesty is pretty unstable to use wireless
[16:36] <Psi-Jack> I-hate-xp: The ATI drivers for Linux suck.
[16:36] <attunix> TheSaint: I do.
[16:36] <vocx> garu, "grub-install" is a utility to reinstall grub in the MBR or elsewhere, and set the proper /boot/grub files, read the manual page "man grub-install"
[16:36] <attunix> :)
[16:36] <Psi-Jack> TheSaint: Yes.
[16:36] <TheSaint> attunix: K
[16:36] <stemount> TheSaint, don't discuss hacking in this channel
[16:36] <stemount> this is a ubuntu help channel lol
[16:36] <gpled> TheSaint: when i golf, people call me a hack
[16:36] <attunix> Everyone, I believe you must know what "hack" means
[16:36] <attunix> it means building software
[16:36] <attunix> testing software
[16:36] <I-hate-xp> Psi-Jack: i overheard that it is opening source now??
[16:36] <garu> vocx thanks
[16:36] <attunix> etc.
[16:36] <Psi-Jack> stemount: Depends on his meaning of "hacking."
[16:36] <stemount> yeah
[16:36] <attunix> not getting into others' computers
[16:36] <jnc> addicted68098: uh, ctrl+f (unlikely) or perhaps F11

[16:37] <jnc> whacking: ... oh nevermind
[16:37] <I-hate-xp> Psi-Jack: so, improving gradually is promising?
[16:37] <asbani> TheSaint: I think you want to talk about cracking, but windows people call it hacking, or hackers. when Hacking is a good thing, they just don't understand it.
[16:37] <attunix> jnc: :P
[16:37] <stemount> WTF VoX ?

They are all now mounted and I can read the contents of them, but I need to make them writeable as well; what's the command I can use?
[16:41] <attunix> gpled: someone at #ubuntu-stemount or #finwyn might be able to answer that

[16:42] <picard_pwns_kirk> and substitute "yourpass" with a password
[16:42] <jnc> we should hide a cryptogram in Ubuntu releases, and make it the IRC channel key

[16:43] <ace_> everytime I start/reboot, I have to turn on pppoe connection by typing sudo pon dsl-provider.. How do I automatically turn this on?
[16:43] <Zambezi> Anyone using cryptsetup-luks?
[16:43] <xanith> Mr_Sonoma: I'm just trying to listen to MP3's but I think I may have just figured out that ubuntu didn't install my sound card correctly...
[16:43] <ace_> is there a "network" tool for pppoe?
[16:43] <mboso_> anyone here using nvidia beta drivers with a stock kernel? how do i keep the stock nvidia kernel module from loading before the beta module?

[16:43] <john_priest> you cant write to them from linux
[16:43] <mboso_> x refuses to start
[16:43] <john_priest> as far as i know
[16:43] <daekdroom> mboso_: do you get an error message?
[16:44] <john_priest> you can mount and read, but this isnt my cup of tea
[16:44] <Zambezi> jnc: I'm using it now and two headers broke, so I'm going to stop use it next week.
[16:44] <xyz> john_priest: I'm using the newer Kubuntu 7.10 which is supposed to have write-possibilities to NTFS drives...?
[16:44] <vocx> Pirate_Hunter, probably you need to change some permissions, although that thing about the proxy seems weird... The answer is there.
[16:44] <mboso_> daekdroom: It says it cannot load nvidia kernel module. then when I rmmod the module, it is able to load the one I compiled.
[16:44] <gpled> has anyone tried just plugging in a printer on 7.10? did it work?
[16:44] <murkyMurk> xyz: writing to NTFS partitions from non MS systems is flaky at best apparently. FAT32 is the recommended beast for compatibility

[16:49] <wolferine> so I just updated to Gutsy, I enabled the restricted driver (Nvidia) and I love the new interface for setting up the display.  I have a dual head card, but I am finding there are issues, the displays are in the reverse.  I tried to sweet each of them, but my desktop still seems to extend past the screen (one is wide @ 1280x800 and the other is 1680x1050 -- the res should be the reverse, the wide should be the 1680x1050 )
[16:49] <justin420> can anybody help with getting a 1680x1050 resolution working in gutsy using a dvi-d connection? this is the only issue that is stopping me from using gutsy right now. I am using a nvidia 6800gs; the highest resolution I can get is 640x480 that looks right
[16:50] <murkyMurk> Iceflame22: not really, a problem such as that is often caused by a less than ideal video driver...give it a go and if it works coem back and we'll look int o why
[16:50] <amrcidiot> want me to paste what it says?
[16:50] <Iceflame22> murkyMurk: okay, thanks.

I've seen that I could possibly install Wine (which I have) and then mount my new NTFS r/w partitions, but I'd rather be able to run a native linux program... Another question I have is where I can check whether my web camera can take shots from Linux?

[16:50] <justin420> it was enabled, it chose the nvidia-glx-new package

[17:14] <arken0493> Shood, if you want to use Yahoo Messenger, get GAIM or PIDGIN. But as for the webcam, i dont know
[17:14] <BoomSie> aata, no, but you need to enable the restricted driver and install it ;)
[17:14] <flagel> phillips321: works great

So my question is: how to fix this? I've heard

[17:28] <dystopianray> LiMaO: a newer version might be in feisty-backports
[17:28] <garu> how do I check the root of my partitions?
[17:28] <jimmacdonald> so it's set to one theme?
[17:28] <joanki> murkyMurk, but if i nwated to close the program through terminal, what would i type in once i do firefox&?
[17:28] <sx66xfce> garu: sudo
[17:28] <dystopianray> garu: sudo touch /forcefsck, then restart
[17:28] <richard> Quick question: Where does one change the icons selection from within Gnome. I downloaded a bunch of icon sets to try out but don't know where to select them from within the menu system. . .
[17:28] <LiMaO> dystopianray: let me enable the extra repositories and check it
[17:28] <vocx> xyz, my suggestion is ubotu's...
[17:29] <seth> okay, then what?
[17:29] <sx66xfce> how do you configure the font size back to original ubuntu 7.04, 7.10 has huge font, even when I put it back to the 7pt it is still big in firefox...
[17:29] <navaburo> garu: type mount
[17:29] <xyz> vocx: I see... I can't find the fn key in there though.
[17:29] <wolferine> who ever was helping me before, the 'swapping monitors' didnt work
[17:29] <dystopianray> LiMaO: don't enable the backports repo just grab the individual debs that you need
[17:29] <LiMaO> dystopianray: oh ok, thank you
[17:29] <murkyMurk> aata: okay, that is an old X desktop. Get a terminal up and run sudo apt-get gnome
[17:29] <murkyMurk> aata: ** sudo apt-get install gnome
[17:29] <tsp> there we go
[17:30] <aata> what do you mean old x?
[17:30] <Psi-Jack> seth: Is all the boxes for Ubuntu SOftware tab checked?
[17:30] <lexx> Screen Resolution:	1024x768
[17:30] <lexx> Color Depth:	24 bit
[17:30] <lexx> Window Size:	1009x785.... now 32 color ?
[17:31] <murkyMurk> aata: hang on use sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment     that'll be much better
[17:31] <aata> wow thats so random... apt-get install gnome actually downloads 42mb!
[17:31] <moope1> hey , my computer keeps freezing up for no aperent reason. can anyone help find out why?
[17:31] <richard> Anybody tell me where to change the icon sets from within Gnome?
[17:31] <wolferine> I love the new interface for setting up the display.  I have a dual head card, but I am finding there are issues, the displays are in the reverse.  I tried to sweet each of them, but my desktop still seems to extend past the screen (one is wide @ 1280x800 and the other is 1680x1050 -- the res should be the reverse, the wide should be the 1680x1050 )
[17:31] <seth> canonical supported open source wasn't
[17:31] <seth> i checked that
[17:31] <aata> thats only 5.8mb
[17:31] <aata> whats the diff...
[17:31] <garu> sx66xfce dystopianray navaburo thanks
[17:32] <vocx> lexx, 24 and 32 bit modes are essentially the same
[17:32] <murkyMurk> aata: X underlies gnome and kde and xfe4..it's the engine that makes windowed GUIs work but it's not a lot of good on it's own...sounds like your crash killed gnome so just reinstall it

[17:47] <MrJoey> shooood> What partitions do you see?
[17:47] <wolferine> I love the new interface for setting up the display.  I have a dual head card, but I am finding there are issues, the displays are in the reverse.

[17:51] <khandy> Hi all, does anyone know how to make Planeshift run right on Feisty Fawn? The text and icons blink rapidly and can't interact with the cursor.
[17:51] <buck> You could simply use Synaptic Package Manager and search for "rar".
[17:51] <nickrud> KR-data: the left windows key
[17:51] <poningru> ubuntu uses gnome and xubuntu uses xfce
[17:51] <raidproblem> poningru: so I guess 4000 ish is better?
[17:51] <mks> niuq: xbuntu is with XFCE
[17:51] <nickrud> KR-data: for nearly everyone, that is

[17:52] <MrJoey> shooood> What are the starts and ends of each partition?
[17:52] <aata> murkymurk with the appearance tool i can turn on compiz, but w/o window borders

[17:52] <buck> To uninstall, type this in Terminal: sudo apt-get autoremove <package>

[17:53] <niuq> mks: 256 ram / 2.10 celeron / no video card
[17:53] <poningru> raidproblem: it depends on what is causing that bug, but search for that line in google, and you should be able to find it in bugs.kernel.org
[17:54] <aata> usually that gets sorted w/ gtk-window-decorator --replace or emerald --replace

[18:02] <aantn> thats from the roadmap
[18:02] <Traveler6> help help
[18:02] <Traveler6> :)
[18:02] <amrcidiot> poningru: i'll restart again and let you know. thanks a lot for all the help.
[18:02] <aata> murkymurk?
[18:02] <nickrud> slaytanic: I'm in the same boat, if you have ati and are using fglrx , you're pretty much out of luck.
[18:02] <julian_> Fryguy--.  Yeah most guys seem to code in lisp.  I have to learn lisp for a data structures class im currently taking
[18:02] <aata> did you get my last?
[18:02] <julian_> errr seem to code in emacs
[18:02] <Fryguy--> Traveler6: if you don't have a philisophical opposition to closed source drivers, nvidia is IMO the best way to go for video cards in linux

[18:02] <murkyMurk> aata: yep?
[18:02] <thesaint> So can anyone help me?
[18:02] <julian_> thanks, murkyMurk .  ill check that out
[18:02] <Traveler6> fryguy wicked, thanks i thought so, intel is good too but i stick with ati or nvidia
[18:02] <warkruid> thesaint: what bluetooth dongle?
[18:02] <aata> no ideas for saving my installed applications?
[18:03] <thesaint> Belkin
[18:03] <Fryguy--> Traveler6: definitely not ati
[18:03] <Traveler6> fryguy iyo is it harder to install nvidia drivers than ati?
[18:03] <Fryguy--> no
[18:03] <Traveler6> wicked
[18:03] <nrp> Traveler6, it depends on what youre doing.  I have a x3100 on my T61, works perfectly with compiz, and probably gets better battery life than the 8400GS
[18:03] <Veinor> Azureus keeps dumping core.
[18:03] <nickrud> aata: save installed? copy /var/cache/apt/archives to a dvd , and also dpkg --get-selections > mypackagelist
[18:03] <Fryguy--> Traveler6: it's easier.  I run an nvidia card at 2560x1600 resolution, with full compiz 3d hardware acceleration, by clicking a single button after the system is installed (and subsequently rebooting)

[18:03] <Traveler6> nrp that was my concern, last laptop had an ati9600 128mb and the battery and heat were extreme under beryl
[18:04] <murkyMurk> aata: nope. :-( still, apps are easy to reinstall. Just back up your home dir and all the little ~.profile files will do the rest
[18:04] <thesaint> warkruid
[18:04]  * nickrud is pricing a new laptop, just to get away from ati
[18:04] <warkruid> thesaint: belkin needs a proprietary driver. maybe it doesn't get loaded?
[18:04] <Traveler6> i would be on a laptop
[18:04] <Traveler6> nickrud good then, im testing nvidia waters,
[18:04] <thesaint> So how do i do that
[18:04]  * murkyMurk away making fresh tea
[18:04] <nrp> Traveler6, if you're not planning on gaming on it, you're probably better off with the x3100.  cheaper and better battery life
[18:04] <Traveler6> seeing that ati has gotten a bit bad reputation
[18:04] <alex-weej> no canonical commercial repo yet?
[18:04] <Traveler6> nrp, probably do a little gaming, perhaps more

[18:05] <Traveler6> nickrud on ati?
[18:05] <aata> nickrud is that verycomplicated? because i usually screw things up...
[18:05] <x__> Hi, can someone help me finding the right server? All new in here and know nothing about IRC..
[18:05] <thesaint> how do i make a proprietary driver
[18:05] <warkruid> thesaint: It's been awhile since I played with bluetooth. more info can be found on bluez.sourceforge.net. Be aware it is mainly commandline oriented.
[18:05] <Veinor> when I run it from the terminal, nothing unusual happens until I get a line that  says "Aborted (core dumped)"
[18:05] <john_priest> x__ what do you need ?
[18:05] <Lars_G> Ok all. Good day. I have a very very very odd problem with my nvidia card and it's drivers, anybody here with GOOD experience wants to help?
[18:05] <nickrud> Traveler6: yes, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/121653 . I'm researching workarounds, but it seems going back to 2.6.20 or recompiling is the only option
[18:05] <wolferine> I love the new interface for setting up the display.  I have a dual head card, but I am finding there are issues, the displays are in the reverse.  I tried to sweet each of them, but my desktop still seems to extend past the screen (one is wide @ 1280x800 and the other is 1680x1050 -- the res should be the reverse, the wide should be the 1680x1050 )
[18:05] <x__> I have to find the indymedia server..
[18:05] <nrp> Traveler6, in that case, go for the 8400GS.  You cant play anything made in the last decade on an x3100 :p
[18:05] <Fryguy--> Lars_G: ask a real question

[18:06] <napster> fine. i have just put in a drive into my computer to use it 2 back up my data...problem is i cant write to it. i have ntfs config tool installed but the internal option is not available...how can i fix it?
[18:06] <Traveler6> nrp haha will do, im planning on getting that lappy with 8400 just needed a quick tip if it would be better on linux,

[18:10] <julian_> Fryguy--, are you familiar with a linux version of mlisp?  we're instructed to use mlisp on some Solaris boxes, but I'd prefer to work on my local system.  I was able to find the package "cl-umlisp", but no compiler
[18:10] <aata> but rooting for him anyway
[18:10] <Fryguy--> napster: what other internal drive
[18:10] <warkruid> flick: make a cron job that checks system load.
[18:10] <slaytanic> nickrud: Seriously?
[18:10] <aata> nickrud?
[18:10] <flick> warkruid, thanks i will look up on that on the net
[18:10] <Fryguy--> julian_: are you sure you need a compiler? Not many versions/dialects of lisp actually compile to machine code.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head is gambit-c
[18:10] <nickrud> slaytanic: about the backup? yes. A sec, and aata I'll find a link
[18:10] <pommer> what is the best cd burner for linux? i need to burn a iso image

[18:11] <Fryguy--> napster: is it mounted?
[18:11] <julian_> Fryguy--, no idea.  I know nothing at all about lisp.
[18:11] <Pelo> anyone know how to make the emblems bigger ?
[18:11] <aata> thanks a mil :)
[18:11] <flick> warkruid, now that i know what to look for, i think i will find out a way :)
[18:11] <vocx> Lars_G, I assume you read the release notes that said something that dual head lost support in xinerama or something. I have no experience I just read that.
[18:11] <stian> hello everyone, someone who know of a program that can copy a color from my screen and tell me the collor code in hex ?
[18:11] <warkruid> flick: or start that bittorrent client on the background with low priority
[18:11] <nickrud> slaytanic: yes, read that bug report, it's really long and detailed
[18:11] <Fryguy--> julian_: well where are you getting the thought that you require a compiler?
[18:11] <napster> i think so...i can c its contents but i cant write 2 it
[18:11] <julian_> Fryguy--, I guess it wouldn't be compiled, but rather interpreted
[18:11] <jnc> pommer: k3b is my favorite GUI app for doing this, but otherwise you'd just do "cdrecord file.iso"
[18:11]  * Lars_G sighs
[18:11] <Fryguy--> napster: and how did you mount it?

[18:17] <Pelo> Tritonio, are you running compiz ?
[18:17] <aata> and will the !cloning info do that for me?
[18:17] <garu> hi everyone again
[18:17] <MartinW> Is Ubuntu or Kubuntu best if you want lots of stylish white and chrome eyecandy?
[18:17] <Fryguy--> how can I use console fonts as opposed to truetype fonts in gnome-terminal?
[18:17] <maddler> did anyone got luck with dealing with grub/vga bug (#129910) in gutsy?
[18:17] <IdleOne> !upgrade | Ashfire908
[18:17] <ubotu> Ashfire908: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[18:17] <Tritonio> Pelo, yes. And i also have installed the compizmanager
[18:17] <Fryguy--> MartinW: both major desktop environments have plenty of support for theming however you want
[18:17] <Pelo> Tritonio, nvm my last qeustion,  rightclick just to the left of the left most window button,  select properties, it is in there somewhere
[18:18] <nickrud> aata: for that ubotu factoid, prepend copying the cache to/from the original/new to the get/set commands
[18:18] <Dialntone> im having a problem trying to play 720p, and 420p on my computer
[18:18] <garu> why do I get a warning qhen starting ubuntu about the rc80211_simple module?
[18:18] <cosmodad> I see the release notes to Gutsy still being rather extensive. Is this an indicator that I should still resist from upgrading, or can I go from Feisty to Gutsy right away?
[18:18] <Dialntone> avi formats...
[18:18] <MartinW> Can you please give me a link to a good site for GNOME eyecandy?
[18:18] <Dialntone> any help?
[18:18] <nickrud> aata: er, from/to that is
[18:18] <pommer> whats the diffrence between 7.4 and 7.10?
[18:18] <JoeyAdams> Blah
[18:18] <romeo_> how do i install gyachie on gutsy ?
[18:18] <Fryguy--> MartinW: keep in mind that they are both part of the same distribution, just one defaults to kde and one defaults to gnome.  Both can be installed and used side by side if you want to play around (meaning: it doesn't really matter what you start with)
[18:18] <jimmacdonald> Pelo: Thanks.

[18:18] <Pelo> Tritonio,  try asking in #ubuntu-effects then it migth be compiz related
[18:18] <Shaze> How do I get Emerald Themes to load by default on startup over Compiz? Whatever I add to session gets overridden by compiz or something.
[18:19] <rjonesx> how do i turn on beryl effects, like the 4 rotating screen cube?
[18:19] <Tritonio> Pelo, ok i will. thank you Pelo. ;-)

[18:19] <lgc__> Anyone familiar with Exaile! here?
[18:19] <rjonesx> ok
[18:19] <rjonesx> thanks
[18:19] <Pelo> rjonesx, ask in #compiz-fusion
[18:19] <Fryguy--> lgc__: I use it
[18:19] <cosmodad> acidx: ok thanks for the note
[18:19] <Pelo> crdlb,  I thought it was getting redirected to #compiz-fusion automaticaly ?
[18:19] <garu> why do I get a warning qhen starting ubuntu about the rc80211_simple module?can someone help?
[18:19] <murkyMurk> ahh yes, back to why I came. 3D cube has slowed right down..any one else suffering?
[18:19] <IdleOne> crdlb: it redirects to #compiz-fusion
[18:19] <Aoife> Hi all, I'm having a problem with the Feisty LiveCD (I'm using Feisty because Gutsy doesn't even get to X). Last night, I booted and my net connection (dhcp on cable modem -> ehternet) was set up perfectly. Now, any time I try it, the connection appears to be set up, but won't work. (see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41549/ ) - I'm back on windows now, so I can't give an lspci just yet.
[18:20] <Pelo> lgc__,  better ask a specific question
[18:20] <romeo_> help please i need my gyachi and dont know how to use tarballs
[18:20] <riotkittie> murkyMurk: what graphics card are you using?
[18:20] <Tomi_G> How do I open RAR files? I've installed unrar-free
[18:20] <selfsearcher[]> Just a question: I downloaded and installed Gutsy. Now, I use a router with "auto DHCP". With Feisty I had no problems. Now, with Gutsy (GNOME + Connection-manager if I understood right) I have several problems with my connection. I have to restart it ...
[18:20] <crdlb> Pelo, but it doesn't serve the same purpose that #ubuntu-effects did
[18:20] <murkyMurk> Pelo: no you need to type /j #compiz-fusion
[18:20] <Fryguy--> Aoife: to help you with the gutsy booting, have you tried using safe graphics mode (second option on the list)
[18:20] <lgc__> Fryguy--, I've been trying to add some station to it, and it stubbornly refuses to do it. Do you know a sure way to dp it?
[18:20] <Pelo> Tomi_G,  sudo apt-get install unrar  then right click the file and extract here
[18:20] <aata> nickrud whats all that to/from stuff?
[18:20] <warkruid> romeo_: wat kind of tarballs source or binaries
[18:20] <pommer> is 7.10 worth installing.. is it alot better??
[18:20] <defrysk> Tomi_G, install unrar
[18:20] <Fryguy--> lgc__: no
[18:20] <xander21c> hello, do you know where can i find ubuntu 3d logo svg file
[18:20] <lgc__> Pelo, hi.

[18:20] <YOgui666> hi!!!!
[18:21] <cycore> hi! does anyone know how to crop pdf pages? i want to remove the white border. i know a windows tool named PDFCrop, but is there anything similar for linux?
[18:21] <Fryguy--> pommer: of course it's worth installing, if not for all of the various updates to programs
[18:21] <nickrud> aata: 1. do the get command. 2. burn that, and /var/cache/apt/archives/* to a cd. 3. Install. 4. copy the files back to /var/cache/apt/archives on the new install. 5. run the set command on the mypackages file. 6. Watch your system update, without downloading :)
[18:21] <YOgui666> some doby speak spanish?
[18:21] <Pelo> !es | YOgui666
[18:21] <lgc__> Fryguy--, have you ever tried it?
[18:21] <Aoife> Fryguy: thanks... I'll try that and get back.
[18:21] <selfsearcher[]> YOgui666: io italiano ;)
[18:21] <ubotu> YOgui666: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[18:21] <YOgui666> jejejejej right
[18:21] <pommer> is it like updating from win98se to win xp?
[18:21] <aata> !cloning
[18:21] <ubotu> To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade » - See also !automate
[18:21] <Fryguy--> lgc__: nope, I listen to locally stored music
[18:21] <riotkittie> murkyMurk:  ah :|
[18:21] <lgc__> Fryguy--, thanks.
[18:21] <YOgui666> grcias ubotu
[18:21] <newguy> anyone else having trouble with openoffice in gutsy? it wont start at all, when i click on it, absolutly nothing happens, and theres not crash report in /var/crash about it :S
[18:22] <Fryguy--> lgc__: why not try exaile's channel, since this isn't an ubuntu problem
[18:22] <murkyMurk> riotkittie: just wondered if an update had caused mayhem...apparently not
[18:22] <nickrud> aata: that's assuming you'll want to get from the net; if the package is already in the cache, it won't redownload them
[18:22] <aata> okay so first
[18:22] <Pelo> newguy, make sure you update there were a butload of updated packages for OOo this morning
[18:22] <murkyMurk> newguy: nope, works perfectly here..try a reinstall
[18:22] <Dialntone> why won't my computer play 720p  420p avi formats, it just crashes...
[18:22] <aata> yeah and if it isnt itll just default to download?
[18:22] <Dialntone> is it a codec problem?
[18:22] <lgc__> Fryguy--, spare me the aseptic views, please.
[18:22] <Fryguy--> Dialntone: way too vague to help you
[18:22] <newguy> i did update, still probs :S
[18:23] <defrysk> Dialntone, or a too light pc
[18:23] <murkyMurk> Dialntone: use mplayer or vlc to play them
[18:23] <Fryguy--> lgc__: ?? figured it'd make sense to talk to people who are experts of the application you are having issues with.
[18:23] <Pelo> Dialntone, could be , open synaptic and install every single  gstreamer0.10 packages you see
[18:23] <selfsearcher[]> I have a problem with Gusty + DHCP
[18:23] <Dialntone> :D
[18:23] <Dialntone> okay
[18:23] <aantn> is it possible to convert/trace a png into an svg?
[18:23] <nickrud> newguy: someone mentioned there's some new oo packages, try updating. Might fix it
[18:23] <newguy> just tried update manager now, no updates available
[18:24] <Pelo> selfsearcher[],  if you upgraded , I had a problem with nm applet not seeing my connection , I had to redo pppoeconf for it to work properly
[18:24] <Fryguy--> aantn: not really, can't really convert rasterized to vectorized
[18:24] <newguy> i did update some stuff couple hours ago that were related to OO
[18:24] <riotkittie> the one time i have noticed compiz-fusion slowing to a crawl on my end, it was due to the animations. but my graphics card sucks. :D
[18:24] <murkyMurk> aata: yeah, gimp'll do it
[18:24] <nickrud> newguy: erm, nm, I read too far back. Did you tell the update manager to check?
[18:24] <newguy> but still having troubles
[18:24] <newguy> yup
[18:24] <newguy> i clicked check
[18:24] <joanki1> i'm trying to listen to a windows media player video online.... it won't do it - how do i get it to work?
[18:24] <Pelo> newguy, check in synaptic under filters see if you have any broken packages , if not , reintsall the OOo packages
[18:24] <aantn> Fryguy--: can't flash do it?
[18:24] <newguy> ah ok, ty
[18:24] <doodle77> i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?
[18:24] <YOgui666> i have problems with my coneection. the ip static configuration seems does not work
[18:24] <_pirinto_> Hi, has anyone here had any issues on saving files created on office2007 on a samba share? I've only found a few solutions on the net and they don't seem to apply. I'm running Gutsy Gibbon
[18:24] <nickrud> hey Pelo haven't seen you for a while
[18:25] <Pelo> joanki1,  you need mozilla-mplayer probably it works for some
[18:25] <rambo3> joanki1: mplayer mms://
[18:25] <Fryguy--> aantn: not really, by rasterizing an image, you are losing the data that allows the image to be freely scaled up or down
[18:25] <aata> so lets get this straight. i get a package list with dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages. i copy that, along with the contents of /foo/moo/archives/* to a cd. i then copy the /foo/moo/archives/* to the one on the new install. i then run the sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade. about right?
[18:25] <murkyMurk> riotkittie: I've turned animations off as they were getting slow. Dunno, maybe a reboot..i suppose it is still beta ware#
[18:25] <cycore> does no one know how to crop pdf pages?
[18:25] <Pelo> nickrud, got a new job, I get home tired, and I donT' feel like dealing with this channel most night
[18:25] <lgc__> Fryguy--, thanks, I'm on the channel now. It's just that there's always someone telling you you're doing something 'unappropriate' on this channel.
[18:25] <aantn> Fryguy--: I'd like to vectorize a raster
[18:25] <selfsearcher[]> Pelo: the strange thing is: I didn't upgrade and kubuntu (installed after ubuntu) works well... don't know why but GNOME has problems. I have to restart my connection (router with DHCP)
[18:25] <nickrud> aata: yup
[18:25] <aata> awesome will try
[18:25] <nickrud> Pelo: congrats
[18:25] <Pelo> selfsearcher[], I'm stumpped then
[18:25] <Fryguy--> lgc__: mostly because the vast majority of this channel is
[18:25] <aata> ill inform you if it works.
[18:26] <aata> thanks a mil even if it doesnt
[18:26] <riotkittie> murkyMurk: restarting X alone might do as much as a reboot.
[18:26] <kst-> are the CD isos being updated regularly btw? or will they stay the same from first release on?
[18:26] <doodle77> aantn: http://potrace.sf.net
[18:26]  * nickrud slinks away from Fryguy-- 
[18:26] <nickrud> :)
[18:26] <lgc__> Fryguy--, unappropriate?
[18:26] <selfsearcher[]> Well, in the end KDE part is working good. Maybe the problem is with the GNOME Connection Manager :\
[18:26] <YOgui666> hmmmm...
[18:26] <murkyMurk> riotkittie: probably..here goes
[18:26] <fuligin> i take it many ppl are having probmes ???
[18:27] <riotkittie> good luck
[18:27] <YOgui666> but can i install the conection manager of Kde in gnome¿
[18:27]  * justin420 wonders how to backup from enabling the restricted driver for my nvidia card when i cant login into via gui?
[18:27] <fuligin> anyone know how to deal with apci ??
[18:27] <Pelo> kst-, unless there is a massive amount of updated  they should stay the same until the next release ie 6 months
[18:27] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, just keep it clean and you'll be fine
[18:27] <britt_> where are mouse settings stored?
[18:27] <selfsearcher[]> I only had a problem with ethernet DHCP (automatic) connection in Gutsy's GNOME
[18:27] <aata> dont know if youve notices nickrud, but there are more ppl in the channel today and yesterday, than any other day
[18:27] <aata> :)
[18:27] <britt_> as in other than /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[18:27] <nickrud> aata: ooh, might break 1500 soon.
[18:28] <aata> that'd be exciting hahah :D
[18:28] <DevideZero> gobuntu have own site ?
[18:28] <IdleOne> 7.04 release hit 1501
[18:28] <A1f422> Ever since I upgraded to gutsy, sound is no longer working in Wine. Wine is set to use alsa for sound output. Under feisty I was already using PulseAudio and Wine was happy enough talking to it via ALSA. Now wine spews this mess into the console when I run winecfg and the sound test fails: http://pastebin.com/m34feffc9 . Sound is working with Amarok, aplay, etc. Any ideas or further debugging advice?
[18:28] <riotkittie> no, that'd be madness
[18:28] <Pelo> selfsearcher[], try redoing the setup for the connection , ei make a new one
[18:28] <lgc__> Paddy_EIRE, that's what I say: many people here are most concerned with "keeping it clean" than with offering any help (not exactly your case, Fryguy-- ).
[18:28] <riotkittie> what the hay is gobuntu?
[18:28] <jared> !nvidia-glx-new
[18:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia-glx-new - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[18:28] <jared> !nvidia
[18:28] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[18:28] <vocx> nickrud, aata strangely, one day before gutsy the channel was to its usual 1090
[18:28] <selfsearcher[]> Pelo: make a new one? How?
[18:28] <Pelo> riotkittie, new distro,  strictly FOSS , not commercial repos or restricted stuff
[18:28] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, keeping it clean is easy.. as is getting help
[18:29] <fuligin> can anyone suggest if its better loading 7.04 rather then 2.10
[18:29] <fuligin> 7.10
[18:29] <Pelo> selfsearcher[], menu > system > admin > network
[18:29] <YOgui666> gobunut, it`s a kind of basic linux to make mods and create your own linux version
[18:29] <nickrud> vocx: yesterday I was the 1337 'th user. Destiny :)
[18:29] <bulmer> has it been worth its while, upgrading in the most recent one?  seems like major problem to lots..
[18:29] <britt_> i need to know where mouse tracking (speed) settings are stored for X
[18:29] <doodle77> i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?
[18:29] <dbzdeath> hey i'm trying to use uvesafb but i cannot get it to work and i believe it is  because when i add the v86d into the initramfs in the kernel config ubuntu doesn't include it or something could anyone help me please?
[18:29] <Jabberwock> Is this black&white thing new in ubuntu 7.10?
[18:29] <Dreamglider> has anyone had problems installing Ubuntu 7.04 and/or 7.10 on a dell inspiron 9400 ?
[18:29] <vocx> A1f422, check launchpad for bugs in wine in the new release.
[18:29] <Jabberwock> When FireFox is loading a page the window goes black&white
[18:29] <riotkittie> bulmer: only you can answer that.
[18:29] <Jabberwock> Same with banshee
[18:29] <Jabberwock> It's sort of annoying
[18:29] <noobuntu> does anyone use virtualbox in ubuntu?
[18:30] <vocx> nickrud, how?!
[18:30] <selfsearcher[]> Pelo: just done it few hours ago. It seems that Connection Managers needs something called "roaming"... don't know if this is the problem. Feisty worked flawlessy
[18:30] <garu> noobuntu yep
[18:30] <pommer> stupid question maybe... but is slackware better the ubuntu??
[18:30] <jared> I installed nvidia-glx-new...when I am dpkg-reconfig xserver-xorg, will it be nv or nvidia?
[18:30] <nickrud> fuligin: depends on a lot of stuff. For some people sticking with 7.04 is better, others upgrading is better.
[18:30] <A1f422> vocx: okay, thanks
[18:30] <tehlaser> noobuntu, yes
[18:30] <schulenberg> hi
[18:30] <bulmer> riotkittie: in the past 3 days, most issues has been the upgrade didnt do well..
[18:30] <warkruid> pommer: not better, different
[18:30] <IdleOne> pommer: yes and no depends who you ask
[18:30] <nickrud> vocx: user count. lasted about 3 seconds
[18:30] <selfsearcher[]> pommer: more customizable, maybe
[18:30] <fuligin> nickrud, im doing a new install, havent fully used either
[18:30] <aata> because, vocx, people hadnt yet witnessed the wrath of an improperly executed upgrade
[18:30] <Fryguy--> how can I use artwiz and other console fonts in gnome-terminal?
=== Aishiko_ is now known as Aishiko
[18:30] <riotkittie> pommer: it depends on your needs, your taste. i wouldn't say better. i'd say different. each are excellent distros with their own merits
[18:31] <warkruid> pommer: you can customize it easier, Slackware that is..
[18:31] <vocx> noobuntu, there is a new subforum in ubuntuforums.org regarding virtualization now. Read the stickies. Very complete information.
[18:31] <aata> ***aata laughs in the face of the ubuntu-devil and tells him to bring it on
[18:31] <Paddy_EIRE> pommer, not recomended unless you're an advances linux user
=== GodTodd_ is now known as GodTodd
[18:31] <Fryguy--> noobuntu: speaking of virtualbox, I'd highly recommend qemu over virtualbox from my research and experience
[18:31] <Paddy_EIRE> pommer, stick with ubuntu
[18:31] <newguy> damnit!!! i just reinstalled OO and its still the same thing happening! which is nothing! it wont even bloody start ..
[18:31] <Pelo> selfsearcher[], like I said when I started,  the network manager applet seems to have problems recognising connection stuff from previous versions when you upgrade, I had to redo my connection stuff m anualy and reboot for it to work properly,  it was affecting other apps as well, even tho I was actualy connected
[18:31] <schulenberg> can somebody recommend a graphical user editor for GRUB? I have just installed startup manager .. as a recommondation out of this channel, but it is not possible to add my DOS 6.22 Partition?
[18:31] <lgc__> Paddy_EIRE, that's what I mean by "purism". So many folks here refering to the etiquette, or the official topic, or the language or whatever... they just increase the traffic unnecessarily. Real "offenders" are not so common.
[18:31] <warkruid> pommer: have to agree with Paddy_EIRE
[18:31] <nickrud> fuligin: I can say that if you have recent ati, and want the compiz desktop, and have a laptop, stick with 7.04. Harder to install, but suspend works
[18:31] <bulmer> Fryguy--: why so? i have not used either yet..
[18:31] <fuligin> nikrud:both have apci problems, so very long tim eto start up
[18:31] <kst-> how do I setup my s-video output to TV (pal-b) with ati fglrx on gutsy? anything special? my former solution from feisty got broken with the upgrade :(
[18:31] <riotkittie> bulmer: people who have had no problems with the upgrade typically dont come to support channels to announce that things are great.
[18:31] <schulenberg> thx in advance
[18:31] <tehlaser> Fryguy: Really?  I've always had performance problems with qemu...
[18:31] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, never happened to me
[18:32] <Paddy_EIRE> !patience | lgc__
[18:32] <ubotu> lgc__: The people here are volunteers, your attitude may determine how fast you are helped.  Not everyone is available all the time, likewise not every answer is available instantly. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[18:32] <Fryguy--> tehlaser: did you install the kernel drive?
[18:32] <vega-> what's the difference between the -386 and -generic kernel in gutsy? (-generic boot fails on my system, -386 is ok)
[18:32] <bulmer> riotkittie: i hope they do and help out the rest thats struggling with the upgrade
[18:32] <noobuntu> Fryguy--, why is that?
[18:32] <selfsearcher[]> Pelo: so if I use, say, KUbuntu (installed via Synaptic) I have this problem no more
[18:32] <nickrud> riotkittie: yeah, most don't even know to come here ;(
[18:32] <Fryguy--> tehlaser: using /dev/kqemu makes it use the virtualization tech in my processor and run at 100% native speed
[18:32] <tehlaser> both kqemu and kvm give me stability issues...
[18:32] <fuligin> nikrud, so i guess i should stick to 7.04
[18:32] <TFrog> anyone here an ATI proprietary driver specialist?
[18:32] <tehlaser> maybe I've just got funky hardware.
[18:32] <lgc__> Paddy_EIRE, maybe you strictly abide by the rules. But you don't need to stay long to watch someone scold someone else for their 'improper' behaviour.
[18:32] <Fryguy--> noobuntu: qemu is older, more mature, better support, and largely faster in benchmarks
[18:33] <Paddy_EIRE> !anyone | TFrog
[18:33] <ubotu> TFrog: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[18:33] <fuligin> tfrog use envy
[18:33] <murkyMurk> riotkittie: gdm had all kinds of problems in the X restart....a full restart has it sorted and back to speed
[18:33] <selfsearcher[]> TFrog: not a specialist but maybe I know something ;)
[18:33] <Pelo> selfsearcher[], as far as a know the nm applet is part of gnome ( and that is the buggy bit) , so I guess kubuntu doesn'T have the problem
[18:33] <nickrud> fuligin: I'm rassling with it, maybe soon I can put something on the wiki that no one here will support
[18:33] <niwt> vega-: generic kernel has smp enabled, and I don't know what else
[18:33] <Fryguy--> god i hate my terminal colors :(
[18:33] <tehlaser> I love the flexibility of qemu though.
[18:33] <mik3> !upgrade
[18:33] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[18:33] <selfsearcher[]> Pelo: thank you. Now I see :D !!
[18:33] <kst-> how do I setup my s-video output to TV (pal-b) with ati fglrx on gutsy? anything special? my former solution from feisty got broken with the upgrade :(
[18:33] <doodle77> i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not r myight next to router. any idea what's wrong?
[18:33] <nickrud> !envy | TFrog
[18:33] <ubotu> TFrog: envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[18:33] <m11> hello
[18:33] <noobuntu> Fryguy--, isnt qemu picky about what runs in it?
[18:33] <aata> how big should my installation partition be, nickrud? about 10gb ok?
[18:33] <Fryguy--> noobuntu: not from my experience
[18:33] <stemount> aata thats fine :)
[18:34] <vega-> niwt: you don't by any chance happen to have pointers to more specific info?
[18:34] <Paddy_EIRE> oh have been active in this channel for over a year
=== Kwitschibo_ is now known as Kwitschibo
[18:34] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, ^^
[18:34] <fuligin> envy does wonders even for newbies like me :)
[18:34] <noobuntu> Fryguy--, can you run freedos or minix3 in qemu with everything working and without errors?
[18:34] <aata> what about a boot partition
[18:34] <Fryguy--> noobuntu: no idea, haven't tried
[18:34] <schulenberg> can somebody recommend a graphical user editor for GRUB? I have just installed startup manager .. as a recommondation out of this channel, but it is not possible to add my DOS 6.22 Partition?
[18:34] <ali110> hi i just installed ubuntu 7.10 ( i am a sort of noob to linux)  it asked me if i want to install ATI display card property driver and i accepted after restart now i cant make my resolution any bigger than 800 * 600 what went wrong and how i cant correct this ???
[18:34] <warkruid> pommer: why the question about Slackware?
[18:34] <tehlaser> freedos works fine for me.
[18:34] <newguy> ok, whomelese is having problems with Open Office? i just reinstalled, yet its not starting up
[18:34] <nickrud> aata: yes, for experimenting. If you plan on putting much music or video on it, you make your home another partition and much bigger
[18:34] <vega-> seems also -generic is tickless while -386 is not
[18:34] <Fryguy--> noobuntu: my advice to you would be to experiment to see which suits your needs the best
[18:34] <lgc__> Paddy_EIRE, on the other hand, take #debian, for example: it has as much traffic as this channel, and nobody raises an eyebrow when someone says "f*ck!" or whatever 4-letter word they please.
[18:34] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, why whats the problem anyway
[18:34] <TFrog> i'm having an issue with the ATI proprietary drivers. i followed the instructions here ->http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_GuideP and when i type fglrxinfo i get Xlib: extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[18:34] <Fryguy--> how can I use console fonts in gnome-terminal?
[18:35] <vocx> Fryguy--, you should give your opinions in the new virtualization subforum, if you haven't done already. Also, it might be useful to point what is better for a new user and what for an advanced user or business.
[18:35] <Paddy_EIRE> !offtopic | lgc__
[18:35] <ubotu> lgc__: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[18:35] <nickrud> lgc__: debian doesn't care that kids are around.
[18:35] <Pelo> schulenberg, I don'T thknk there is such a thing , I can give you a link to the grub manual or you can try asking in #grub
[18:35] <TFrog> so i end up with no ati
[18:35] <fuligin> nikrud, thanks for your help, i will reinstall 7.04, but do u have any clue about apci loading problems ?
[18:35] <whonicca> is it possible to upgrade from edgy to gusty?
[18:35] <joanki> mozilla-mplayer won't play the video - any other suggestions?
[18:35] <nickrud> fuligin: no, sorry
[18:35] <aata> i already have a home partition. its called /media/sda4. i wanna know which partition i should use for my install. my 10gb, or my 100mb boot partition.. the 10gb one, right?
[18:35] <schulenberg> thx!!
[18:35] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, whats the technical problem anyhow
=== bruenig is now known as csc`
[18:35] <tehlaser> alill0: Go to system, administration, screens... and try some of the settings there.  The second tab has driver stuff in it.
[18:35] <Pelo> whonicca,  you can only upgrade to the next release in the series
[18:35] <Fryguy--> whonicca: IIRC you have to upgrade to feisty first, then to gutsy
[18:35] <nickrud> aantn: 10, yes.
[18:35] <ckw> TFrog:what video card are you using?
[18:35] <fuligin> nickrud thanks, will see wut happens,
[18:35] <nickrud> aata: 10 yes
[18:35] <fuligin> thanks for ur help guys
[18:35] <whonicca> Fryguy--, whats the easiest way of accomplishing that?

[18:36] <murkyMurk> joanki: divx plugin for firefox is good..google for it
[18:36] <nickrud> aantn: personally, I don't use a separate boot partition any more. I hear that raid & lvm need it, but otherwise ..
[18:36] <riotkittie> DevideZero: errr try googling for it?

[18:36] <else> anyone using pureftpd with virtual users? can't login at all, always getting "530 authentication failed"
[18:36] <tehlaser> joanki: if you're trying to stream it, try opening the playlist file in a text editor and passing the URL in there directly to mplayer.
[18:36] <Pelo> joanki, dl the file and play it on your desktop
[18:36] <atouk> it seems like if root login is enabled, sudo doesn't work for users.    is there a fix?
[18:37] <tehlaser> joanki: That's worked for me before.
[18:37] <troxor> atouk: sudo visudo
[18:37] <Pelo> later folks
[18:37] <riotkittie> yes. the fix is not enabling root. tsk tsk. <hides>
[18:37] <nickrud> atouk: that is not true.
[18:37] <ckw> TFrog:OK...i have an older card but i am still having issues with getting the proprietary driver functioning as well
[18:37] <joanki> thx
[18:37] <riotkittie> bye Pelo
[18:37] <Dreamglider> i installed 6.06 on this inspiron 9400 with no prøblems at all then 7.04 came out bit i have not been able to install it 100% when it´s done i get errors about X not being OK, now i tried 7.10 and get "the sidplay server has been shutdown about 6 times in the last 90 seconds, it is likly that somthing bada is going on. waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display:0"--- does anyone know what could be wrong ?
[18:37] <troxor> atouk: in there, you can specify exactly who gets to use sudo
[18:37] <vocx> atouk, sudo works for those in the sudoers file in the admin group, something like that.
[18:37] <doodle77> i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?
[18:37] <aata> nickrud just tell me this. my install partition mounts on / with bootable flag off, and my boot partition mounts on /boot with bootable flag on, right?
[18:37] <murkyMurk> joanki: really, the divx plugin is ace
[18:38] <stemount> doodle77, whats the wireless card?
[18:38] <nickrud> aata: sure, that's fine
[18:38] <else> doodle77, try to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper
[18:38] <doodle77> uh
[18:38] <aata> awesome thanks nickrud, again
[18:38] <TFrog> ckw, i just installed 7.10 so i may end up reloading and going back to the Mesa driver. it's not bad on glxgears. i get around 1215fps but the proprietary driver under fiesty was getting around 1700fps
[18:38] <lgc__> nickrud, we'd probably ask there about that, I fancy (and still, adults use 4-letter words quite normally). Bottom line is, if you want to get attention on #ubuntu, just break the etiquette or argue against it! See, I've already have gotten responses from about 4 people already, and only one of them offered technical help!
[18:38] <atouk> hot to disable root logins once enabled?
[18:38] <atouk> (how)
[18:39] <doodle77> else: why would ndiswrapper have a stronger connection than bcm43xx?
[18:39] <nickrud> lgc__: cuz we care about this not turning into a flame fest? But I'm dropping this now
[18:39] <ali110> tehlaser: i will try but once before trying things like that on fedora made my screen show me the booting but when linux start it the monitor turns off if that happened what i should do ? ( cause then i wont be able to come to chat and ask the question)
=== DogBoy_ is now known as Dog_Boy
[18:39] <DevideZero> riotkittie , yes and i have found link in ubuntu.com site to gobuntu and its only page there isnt site for gubuntu. . . so im asking here there is official gobuntu site ? ( like edubuntu.org .. . ) ?
[18:39] <niwt> aata: you don't need to bootable flag unless you want grub installed into a partition rather than into the mbr

[18:39] <vocx> doodle77, most wireless drivers have issues because they are reverse-engineered. I think this is known for Broadcom. Look at their web page.
[18:39] <troxor> atouk: sudo -i to get to the root user's account, make up a really long random password, set it, and then forget it :)
[18:39] <Fryguy--> marina: use wine
[18:39] <kiru> where does banshee store the music bibliothek?
[18:39] <vocx> !games > marina
[18:39] <unjustice> Where can I get ALSA 1.0.15 packages for gutsy?
[18:40] <ckw> TFrog:yeah its a real pain in the ass to get these drivers workin...but a challenge as well....from what i can gather here and on other chats there are a lot of issues that are cropping up
[18:40] <kiru> i have about 250GB of mp3s which kills the performance of this player
[18:40] <murkyMurk> marina: google cedega
[18:40] <kiru> any suggestions?
[18:40] <CruX> hello all
[18:40] <aata> troxor what you trying to do? sounds funny
[18:40] <kiru> i dont find anything in the forums
[18:40] <Fryguy--> kiru: strange, my collection is upwards of 800gb and there's no slowdown at all
[18:40] <octo_> now that the kernel shows IDE drives as SCSI, how can you be sure that DMA is working on an IDE drive.  hdparm tells me HDIO_GET_DMA failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device?
[18:40] <ckw> one thing that got me moving forward was to download newer linux drivers from the ATI/AMD site
[18:40] <vocx> marina, don't try to get attention.    Anyway, there is a whole subforum about games in ubuntuforums.org and also a Games Arena.
[18:40] <troxor> aata: just answering questions :)
[18:40] <marina> thank you
[18:40] <CruX> how i can set properly default disk io scheduler for all disks to anticipatory in /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler ?
[18:40] <jrib> !root > atouk
[18:40] <kiru> Fryguy--: how do i delete this bibliothek?
[18:40]  * nickrud wants to clone Fryguy-- 's disk
[18:40] <ali110> i will try to  change my monitor driver and resolution to make it better but once before trying things like that on fedora made my screen show me the booting but when linux start it the monitor turns off if that happened what i should do ? ( cause then i wont be able to come to chat and ask the question)
[18:41] <murkyMurk> kiru: i would gues at ~/.banshee
[18:41] <riotkittie> lgc__: people arent always going to have answers to your questions, and those that do might not be able to give them to you immediately.
[18:41] <Fryguy--> nickrud: it's a multi-disk raid array, have fun with that
[18:41] <ckw> TFrog:also there are some newer drivers due out soon that may solve a lot of this
[18:41] <kiru> Fryguy--: i think it is because the music is stored on an external drive
[18:41] <kst-> any ideas how I put my svideo connected TV as 2nd monitor with this displayconfig-gtk thing? what do I select? (PAL-B standard)
[18:41] <TFrog> ckw, well i hope they are resolved soon. i hear AMD/ATI are going to go full open source with their new drivers for the newest card. we can only hope it trickles backwards for the older cards as well
[18:41] <nickrud> Fryguy--: doable. I'll mail you a bunch of dvd's :)
[18:41] <Fryguy--> kiru: I read my music collection over a network
[18:41] <kiru> Fryguy--: there is no .banshee
[18:41] <lgc__> nickrud, I agree to that. Let me finish by saying that there is no flame fest when there's no bigotry. That said, I thank you and all the fine people who responded to my queries. And I drop the subject now.
[18:41] <tehlaser> alill0: gutsy has "bulletproof" X, basically a fallback if you goof things up too bad.  Your biggest risk is accidentally configuring a dual-output video card or laptop to use the wrong output.  That can be fixed by moving the cable to the other port, possibly requiring an adapter for VGA->DVI compatibility.
[18:42] <ckw> TFrog:i was finally able to get the driver going and the extended desktop to the second monitor but now things like mythtv and celestia are just dog slow
[18:42] <TFrog> ckw, i tried the 8.41.x beta drivers once. they should be out soon. hopefully they will resolve this issue
[18:42] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, could you take this to the offtopic or try again later
[18:42] <nickrud> kiru: banshee keeps it in ~/.config/banshee
[18:42] <aata> nickrud you wont BELIEVE what i just almost did
[18:42] <Dreamglider> i installed 6.06 on this inspiron 9400 with no prøblems at all then 7.04 came out bit i have not been able to install it 100% when it´s done i get errors about X not being OK.
[18:42] <aata> just take a wild guess
[18:42] <Dreamglider> now i tried 7.10 and get "the display server has been shutdown about 6 times in the last 90 seconds, it is likly that somthing bada is going on. waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display:0"--- does anyone know what could be wrong ?
[18:42] <riotkittie> resizing my partitions isnt going to cause issues  with UUIDs is it?
[18:42] <nickrud> aata: install without doing the backup :)
[18:42] <Hazler> Does anyone know if Guild Wars, or Rumble Fighter works on Ubuntu with Wine?
[18:42] <kiru> nickrud: found it :) thx
[18:42] <lgc__> Paddy_EIRE, thanks.
[18:42] <ckw> TFrog:some one was giving me a hand last night and we discovered that direct rendering was not enabled
[18:42] <tehlaser> riotkittie, shouldn't, and never has for me.
[18:42] <murkyMurk> kiru try a simple locate banshee
[18:42] <ali110> tehlaser: ok i will go try the thing just  pray that at least i will be able to get back to the chat
[18:42] <Paddy_EIRE> lgc__, anytime
[18:43] <aata> ALMOST!! i was this close to doing it
[18:43] <riotkittie> Dreamglider: try the alternate install CD?
[18:43] <aata> oh my god
[18:43] <riotkittie> tehlaser: thanks :D
[18:43] <TFrog> i believe that is what is going on here as well
[18:43] <Fryguy--> Dreamglider: it's messing up autodetection.  You'll just have to go and edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file manually
[18:43] <garu> Hazler world of warcraft works in ubuntu, so, guld wars should also work
[18:43] <Dreamglider> riotkittie i tried the 7.04 alternative, same problem
[18:43] <aata> what a fool i am.. see this is why i need to quadruple check every f***ing thing, know what i mean
[18:43] <Paddy_EIRE> garu, how do you figure that one
[18:43] <nickrud> Hazler: try looking on http://appdb.winehq.org/
[18:43] <ckw> TFrog: so i am still plugging along here trying different things..luckily i have a few crash boxen
[18:43] <Hazler> garu, before i actually did play WoW on ubuntu but before Guild wars didnt work
[18:44] <Dreamglider> Fryguy-- i tried aditing the xorg, someone helped me but i still couldnt get it running.
[18:44] <joanki> does anyone know what the extensions are for firefox?  i mean how i can recognize if it is a firefox extension??  is it .so, .xpt?????
[18:44] <ompaul> aata, the use of * does not disguise the need for you to avoid the word fully in irc - you should have checked that also :)
[18:44] <garu> Paddy_EIRE I talked to a guy here, he was way too happy he got WOW installed and running in ubuntu.
[18:44] <jared> I'm in ubuntu gusty and when I try to start spring I get this error from X: Needed extension GL_ARB_texture_compression not found
[18:44] <Dreamglider> maybe you can!
[18:44] <TFrog> i wish i can say the same. but i'm sure someone will find the issue and resolve it rather quickly.
[18:44] <ldrada> Hi.
[18:44] <aata> yeah i know i know but i felt it was necessary
[18:44] <Paddy_EIRE> garu, I dont see how that means guild wars should work too
[18:44] <Vlet> joanki: xpi
[18:44] <aata> you understand right?
[18:45] <joanki> oh
[18:45] <ompaul> aata, and I felt it  was also necessary
[18:45] <kiru> how do i empty the cache of apt?
[18:45] <vega-> kindaLikeIt: apt-get clean
[18:45] <garu> Hazler u wont lose much on trying...I got the Guildwars Nightfall game myself, I just didnt install it yet, because I'm having other sorts of problems...wifi :o
[18:45] <tehlaser> apt-get clean?
[18:45] <nickrud> aata: I have that word as a text replace to freaking, just in case ;)
[18:45] <ckw> TFrog:10-4...i will be on here most of the rest of the day wihile i am working on this...if i get anywhere positive i will post up reults here
[18:45] <ckw> results
[18:45] <aata> you're justified, and i accept what youre saying
[18:45] <aata> haha
[18:45] <Hazler> garu, lol, alright i get
[18:45] <kiru> hm
[18:45] <kiru> the banshe bib is undeletable...
[18:45] <aata> thanks for that nickrud
[18:45] <TFrog> ckw, may i message you?
[18:45] <Hazler> Garu, ill keep trying too
[18:45] <ldrada> I'm trying to get my tv working as a secondary screen. Everything is fine when I turn it on in system->administration->screens and graphics, but even though all settings are correct for both screens, my primary CRT results in a bigger desktop than the resolution can fit, so I have to "scroll" through it.

[18:47] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (type also /msg ubotu Bot). Also avoid adding joke/useless factoids. Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[18:47] <Paddy_EIRE> !botabuse | beni
[18:47] <ubotu> beni: please see above
[18:47] <kiru> murkyMurk: that is the point
[18:47] <Vlet> garu: probably much less than that
[18:47] <riotkittie> garu: what kind of updates?  >_>
[18:47] <kiru> i cannot find the location of the music bib of banshee
[18:47] <nickrud> gardar: they'll come fast & furious for a while, then slack off to nearly nothing
[18:47] <Box|UK> Hamilton finsh 3rd in championship?
[18:47] <ckw> TFrog:cool...chat up rmklumpp..i'll fire it up right now
[18:47] <^Juan^> what file do i have to edit per user screen settings?
[18:47] <buck_> Has anyone learned about or seen the upcoming release?
[18:47] <^Juan^> hamilton second
[18:47] <kiru> it stores it somewhere not listed in "locate banshee" and not in ".conf/banshee"
[18:47] <beni> Paddy_EIRE: ompaul: Just a typo buddy..
[18:47] <ompaul> !offtopic | Box|UK ( yeap)
[18:47] <ubotu> Box|UK ( yeap): #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[18:47] <PriceChild> buck_, it hasn't begun development yet.
[18:47] <vocx> garu, updates are only those addressing security. So they may happen whenever developers want to correct serious flaws
[18:48] <jlilly> What file can I edit to alter the behavior of Xinerama?
[18:48] <riotkittie> upcoming release? 8.04?  or are you talking about the just released 7.10, buck_ ?
[18:48] <buck_> PriceChild: Thank you.
[18:48] <garu> riotkittie I dont know...the ones that would probably sort out the wireless problems, which alot of people are having
[18:48] <murkyMurk> kiru: ahhh, hang on, i'll just install it and see
[18:48] <aata> nickrud problem. i cant open a terminal for some reason...
[18:48] <jlilly> riotkittie, 8.04 is the next release. Hardy Heron, iirc
[18:48] <buck_> riokittie: I was referring to 8.04.
[18:48] <garu> vocx i see
[18:48] <Paddy_EIRE> !hardy > buck_
[18:48] <Vlet> buck_: there will likely be updates to gutsy soon, but not another release for a while
[18:48] <nickrud> kiru: I have banshee.db in that dir
[18:48] <beni> Anyone experience playing "The Sims" With wine / cedega?
[18:48] <riotkittie> buck_: i assumed so, but isnt it a wee bit early? ;)
[18:48] <kiru> nickrud: which dir?
[18:48] <mandrill> can anyone tell me what I need to add to the smb.conf file to add more than one drive to the share?
[18:48] <nickrud> kiru: ~/.config/banshee
[18:48] <aata> how do i enter the reqd commands
[18:49] <kiru> nickrud: i deleted this folder
[18:49] <buck_> riokittie: It is, mate. I took a look on the roadmap, and it seemed like something was going on! :D
[18:49] <ldrada> Nobody can help?
[18:49] <kiru> but after reinstallation it has again the old bib
[18:49] <Box|UK> running  utorrent in wine
[18:49] <mandrill> or do i Just duplicate whats already there with a different path?
[18:49] <riotkittie> garu:  i sorted my own wireless issues by going the ndiswrapper route. <weep>
[18:49] <jlilly> riotkittie, I suppose if you're upgrading from 6.04 (the last LTS release) then I wouldn't think so.
[18:49] <Pici> buck_: We really won't know whats going on until the Ubuntu Developers Summit is over.
[18:49] <troxor> mandrill: should be just another [section], with path, comment, etc
[18:49] <kriel> Hello everyone. I just downloaded a copy of the ubuntu install CD a week ago, and i tried to install ubuntu on my machine. Since the cdrom on this computer is rather buggy, i installed the text-only version and then removed the cd from sources.list . after that, i did $sudo apt-get install gdm   and it ran correctly (i thought) but now it is saying when i reboot that the x server is not working, and that it cannot stat a certain directory.
[18:49] <garu> anyone having problems with kinit image?no "ubuntu loading screen"?
[18:49] <`eric-> anyone rune itunes in wine?
[18:49] <`eric-> run*
[18:49] <nickrud> aata: what do you mean, you can't open a terminal? alt-f2 gnome-terminal nor apps->accessories->terminal don't work?
[18:49] <buck_> Pici: Thank you.

[18:49] <mandrill> cheers troxor
[18:50] <aata> nope
[18:50] <riotkittie> jlilly: eh i've got 6.06 on my laptop.  i'm not in a hurry :P
[18:50] <garu> riotkittie I used ndiswrapper in sabayon...I hate it
[18:50] <garu> lol
[18:50] <Box|UK> eric i use gtkpod for itunes
[18:50] <riotkittie> garu: why do you hate it?
[18:50] <`eric-> gtkpod won't work for my iphone :P
[18:50] <jlilly> riotkittie, I'm not either, really. I wish there was an easy way to downgrade back to feisty.
[18:50] <aata> probably due to my freaking messed up install ;)
[18:50] <kiru> aaaaaaaaah
[18:50] <garu> riotkittie ur in 6.06?
[18:50] <kiru> finally
[18:50] <nickrud> aata: erm. you can do all that at ctl-alt-f1
[18:50] <ldrada> I'm trying to get my tv working as a secondary screen. Everything is fine when I turn it on in system->administration->screens and graphics, but even though all settings are correct for both screens, my primary CRT results in a bigger desktop than the resolution can fit, so I have to "scroll" through it.
[18:50] <kiru> after deleting everything, purging and reinstalling, it is gone :)
[18:50] <Box|UK> iphone lol
[18:50] <troxor> kriel: try `dpkg-reconfigure -a`
[18:50] <riotkittie> garu: no. i'm using my desktop which is chock full of 7.10 goodness. i like it so much that i installed it twice <g>
[18:51] <jared> For some reason, my graphics accelleration isn't working. I get this on line four of my glxinfo "direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)"
[18:51] <FooAtari> Hi have a quick question if someone could help.  I have had a lot of wirless and sound problems with ubuntu previously and have since installed PC Linux OS with little problems.  I know i can get sound to work with some messing about but is the wireless support in ubunu better now.  i have a broadcom4308 (i think) chipset
[18:51] <nickrud> aata: reinstall gnome-terminal , see if that gets it back
[18:51] <jlilly> ldrada, go through your xorg.conf file and remove the line that begins with Virtual (back up first!)
[18:51] <^Juan^> what file do i have to edit per user screen settings?
[18:51] <garu> riotkittie humn...I guess is just not that very good on laptops then.lol
[18:51] <ldrada> jlilly: Ty
[18:51] <nickrud> jared: with xgl & fglrx? If so, that's normal.
[18:51] <Ajzo> does anybody know how to turn off that STUPID mplayer plug-in in Firefox ???
[18:51] <J-23> deinstall it?
[18:52] <troxor> kriel: if the install didn't complete, you can try `apt-get install ubuntu-desktop` to install the default packages
[18:52] <Paddy_EIRE> Ajzo, why.. its hardly stupid
[18:52] <jared> nickrud, I really don't know. I know it's keeping me from playing spring.
[18:52] <nickrud> Ajzo: sudo apt-get remove mozilla-mplayer
[18:52] <kriel> troxor: trying that... what does it do?
[18:52] <riotkittie> garu: it's not bad, but my laptop has a 12gb hard drive, and i've already got a triple boot set up :P
[18:52] <patbam> how can i tell which ubuntu i have? it's been a long time since i upgraded and i don' t remember if it's edgy or what
[18:52] <Ajzo> Paddy_EIRE: i want it that after clicking it will be downloading on my HDD and not shown in FF window
[18:52] <kriel> troxor: trying the dpkg-reconfigure, i mean
[18:52] <tommykn0cker> hi, can anyone tell me how do i change the LC_TIME locate? if i do an "export LC_TIME "bla" it doesnt work after reboot...
[18:52] <nickrud> jared: some ati I can sorta help with, others no
[18:52] <FOAD> Hey, trying to set up my 2 screens on Gutsy, but whatever I do, it seems to make want both screens pan (trying to use nvidia-settings).
[18:53] <FOAD> I DON'T WANT PANNING!?
[18:53] <Box|UK> `eric-:  ive just tried opening itunes with wine it tells me it needs  windows xp or later  think win is  win 98?
[18:53] <jared> I"m in nvidia
[18:53] <FOAD> How do I tell it not to.
[18:53] <troxor> kriel: the first runs package configure scripts for all (-a) packages.. you can single one out by giving the package name instead of -a
[18:53] <justin420> nvidia + gutsy = CRAP
[18:53] <riotkittie>  patbam: cat /etc/lsb-release
[18:53] <ldrada> jlilly: It works! Thank you!
[18:53] <jlilly> justin420, agreed.
[18:53] <aata> nickrud --get-selections doesnt list EVERY installed package does it?
[18:53] <jlilly> ldrada, np.
[18:53] <nickrud> ati + gutsy = CRAP
[18:53] <Skratz0r_> Hello all
[18:53] <patbam> riotkittie: thanks.
[18:53] <nickrud> aata: yes it does
[18:53] <Paddy_EIRE> Ajzo, err.. use gwget.. copy the url of the video in mplayer plugin (ff) and paste it into gwget
[18:53] <Hazler> How do i make a Cube using Compiz?  Cuz i only have 2 Workspaces so its a little 2 sided thing
[18:53] <heatman> Hello, could some one tell me where i can find a wiki concerning the command line to do an image back up of my ubuntu partition please?
=== TheDreamer is now known as Youri
[18:53] <riotkittie> ati + gutsy = working fine for meeee <prances>
[18:53] <garu> nickrud not really :o
[18:53] <aata> so it will download all those packages
[18:53] <aata> ?
[18:53] <Dialntone> anyone know where i can get a player that supports divx 5 ?
[18:54] <ldrada> nickrud: There seems to be an error in your calculation. Here, I've fixed it for you "ati = crap"
[18:54] <aata> i mean install from apt cache.
[18:54] <Ajzo> Paddy_EIRE: little to much to do instead one simple CLICK :)
[18:54] <Skratz0r_> VLC supports DivX, no?
[18:54] <jlilly> I have dual monitors, but with Xinerama enabled, I only have one screen (ie. windows maximize across both monitors) How can I fix this?
[18:54] <Box|UK> ati  xpress 200 FTW :)
[18:54] <Dialntone> im having a lot of problems trying to get an avi file to play :(
[18:54] <riotkittie> Hazler: you have installed compizconfig-settings-manager?
[18:54] <garu> riotkittie working fine for me as well...and I got the problematic graphics card.lol
[18:54] <Paddy_EIRE> Ajzo, hardly....
[18:54] <tehlaser> Hazler: you need the comiz settings app in universe.
[18:54] <aata> but what if i dont have *every* installed package in that folder?
[18:54] <aata> then im screwed!
[18:54] <Box|UK> Dialntone:  use VLC player
[18:54] <hydrogen> are there 2.6.23 debs availible for gutsy somewhere?
[18:54] <Dialntone> i did and it crashes right away
[18:54] <murkyMurk> Skratz0r_: vlc supports everything
[18:54] <justin420> nickrud: ive got a sony vaio pcg-frv28 that works fine with fglrx and compiz-fusion, i just wish i could get this shit working with my nvidia
[18:54] <Skratz0r_> Yah
[18:54] <tehlaser> or you can hack in gconf-manager, but that's not exactly recommended.  :)
[18:54] <aata> and will it install pkgs i already have installed, again? (i.e base pkgs?)
[18:54] <Paddy_EIRE> Ajzo, we are not responsible for your ability to copy and paste
[18:54] <Skratz0r_> I was telling Dialntone.
[18:54] <nickrud> aata: then you have to download them somehow.
[18:54] <jlilly> justin420, what problem are you having?
[18:54] <nickrud> justin420: do you have suspend working?
[18:54] <Box|UK> dail did you install via synaptic with ll the plugins?
[18:55] <Ajzo> Paddy_EIRE: :]
[18:55] <amonkey> whats the equivlant of dvd decrypter in ubuntu? i don't want to reencode or reformat the dvd, just make a decrypted iso with everything intact for archival.
[18:55] <Hazler> yes
[18:55] <justin420> nickrud: yup, surprisingly
[18:55] <Hazler> i have compizconfig
[18:55] <Skratz0r_> Hey dudes...
[18:55] <Paddy_EIRE> Ajzo, if thats too difficult for you then why use linux ;)
[18:55] <vocx> jlilly, maybe you can get something out of this http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710
[18:55] <Hazler> so i open !ccsm
[18:55] <kriel> troxor: its asking some wierd questions, im just doing the best to answer them. in retrospect, wouldn't $dpkg-reconfigure gdm   have been better?
[18:55] <Skratz0r_> I have an iBook, G4. And i want to install Gusty...
[18:55] <tehlaser> I think dvdbackup is in the repos somewhere...
[18:55] <Box|UK> `eric-:  i tried loading itunes through wine it gave me error message stating it needs win xp or later
[18:55] <nickrud> justin420: You must be blessed ;(
[18:55] <Skratz0r_> Is it supported?
[18:55] <J-23> Who can help me with it: http://pastebin.com/d61ac6f92 ?
[18:55] <Skratz0r_> It is, right? PPC and all
[18:55] <Dialntone> this file format is 420p and 720p divx 5
[18:55] <tehlaser> yah, looks like it is in universe.
[18:55] <justin420> jlilly: the only problem i am having is with 1680x1050 resolution using a dvi-d connection on a bfg nvidia geforce 6800gs
[18:56] <nickrud> ldrada: heh. small case vs caps. About right :)
[18:56] <john_priest> patbam
[18:56] <john_priest> try the about menu :-p
[18:56] <Dialntone> i think its a computer issue, don't have enough ram or processing power to play it
[18:56] <john_priest> system - about ubuntu
[18:56] <riotkittie> Hazler: ok, go to System > Preferences > Advanced Appearance ... General Tab. Turn Horizontal Virtual Desktop up to 4
[18:56] <justin420> nickrud: i sometimes wonder.
[18:56] <murkyMurk> Skratz0r_: answered you once, YES
[18:56] <Skratz0r_> Did you? :P
[18:56] <nickrud> I'm gonna go play wow, and forget about ati woes for a while.
[18:56] <Ajzo> Paddy_EIRE: i use linux cuz i prefer the EASIEST and the FASTET way as possible and u give no easy and no fast solution with copying and pasting links to wget :/
[18:56] <murkyMurk> Skratz0r_: lol, easy to miss eh?
[18:56] <jlilly> vocx, I'm actually using a nvidia 7600 gs, but I can't run nvidia-settings due to some bug they percieve in my xorg.conf file
[18:57] <troxor> kriel: xserver-x11 configures the xorg.conf settings, iirc.. usually default answers to the questions are good- what type of stuff is it asking?
[18:57] <aata> ooh nickrud 695 mb of pkg files in the folder
[18:57] <aata> close one
[18:57] <Ashex> Ajzo, middle click?
[18:57] <Skratz0r_> No, murkyMurk i was telling Dialntone something. :P
[18:57] <aata> one cd worth
[18:57] <tommykn0cker> can anyone tell me how do i change the LC_TIME locate?
[18:57] <ali110> tehlaser: wow now i believe its ubuntus xserver is bulitproof it worked very well thanks a lot ( still i have another question)
[18:57] <end0r57> where should i extract themes so i can view and apply them from the Preferences >> Appearance dialog?
[18:57] <FOAD> Hey, trying to set up my 2 screens on Gutsy, but whatever I do, it seems to make want both screens pan (trying to use nvidia-settings). How do I stop it panning?
[18:57] <Ashex> Ajzo, highlight link, go to terminal, type wget , then middle click to paste
[18:57] <kriel> troxor: stuff like... what fontconfig do i want to use, do i want to make fdmount a root user (something about set_root_id)
[18:58] <murkyMurk> tommykn0cker: export LC_TIME=<whatever>   probably
[18:58] <riotkittie> end0r57: if theyre in tar.gz format, you can just drag and drop them onto the appearance window. alternately, extract and move them to .themes
[18:58] <jlilly> FOAD, edit your xorg.conf file to remove the line that begins with Virtual
[18:58] <Hazler> riotkitty THANKS man
[18:58] <jlilly> FOAD, its basically emulating a higher resolution virtually.
[18:58] <mindrape> So I upgraded to 7.10 and now FireFox is crashing ALL the time... anybody know of a bugtraq I can look at for a workaround or something?
[18:58] <tehlaser> alill0: glad you made it back.  :)
[18:58] <N[i]X> hi, does any1 know how to disactivate the graphic effects in the new ubuntu upgrade
[18:58] <N[i]X> ?
[18:58] <end0r57> riotkittie: they show up in my home directory now in .themes after doing so, but they don't show up in the dialog box for me to choose them.
[18:58] <Ajzo> Ashex: it is enough just to clikc middle click and it is downloading instead launching in browser :)
[18:58] <tommykn0cker> murkyMurk: no it doesnt seem to work; at least after reboot its back again
[18:58] <jtaylor> I have a relatively recent laptop and want to upgrade my hard drive... can I buy just any laptop HD and put it in or are there certain compatibility issues with hardware?
[18:58] <troxor> kriel: hm..
[18:58] <riotkittie> N[i]X: go to System > Preferences > Appearance >  last tab, "none"
[18:59] <jlilly> N[i]X, you can remove compiz effects by going to system, prefs, appearance, visual effects
[18:59] <FOAD> jlilly: there is no such line
[18:59] <ali110> when i go to system preferance appearance and go to visual effects tab clicking normal or extra i get a message box telling me that desktop effects could not be enabled, how to enable them
[18:59] <Ashex> Ajzo, you want the web browser to use wget to download?
=== zarul is now known as zarul[brb]
[18:59] <Flannel> jtaylor: as long as its the right connector and size, yeah.
[18:59] <jlilly> FOAD, paste your xorg.conf on a pasting service plz
[18:59] <tehlaser> jtaylor: make sure you get the right interface (SATA, IDE, etc)
[18:59] <aata> nickrud a usb stick will work, right?
[18:59] <murkyMurk> tommykn0cker: make it permanent by adding it as aline to your ~.profile file
[18:59] <tehlaser> If the plug(s) fits, it should work.
[18:59] <kriel> troxor: same error. xserver pukes with an error of... cannot stat /etc/x11/x (no such file or directory)
[19:00] <N[i]X> riotkittie, jlully: yes, none is already selected and it gives me heavy window animation when i open and close programs
[19:00] <murkyMurk> tommykn0cker:  for instance, in mine I have export BROWSER=/usr/bin/opera
[19:00] <Box|UK> `eric you here?
[19:00] <Ajzo> Ashex: no. i just want to download a movie file WITH SIMPLE LEFT CLICK instead watch it in Firefox via mplayer plug-in
[19:00] <garu> ali110 did u enable restricted drivers?
[19:00] <Paddy_EIRE_> Ajzo, very simple.. start the video in the browser right click the playing video window and copy url.. then paste into gwget easy :D
[19:00] <Ashex> Ajzo, ah
[19:00] <Ashex> that's a firefox issue
[19:00] <ali110> garu : yes i did that
[19:00] <bruenig> Ajzo, remove the plugin
[19:00] <riotkittie> end0r57: if youre using 7.10, try "customize" in the appearance window. some will show up as full themes, some wont. i have a bunch of stuff under the latter
[19:00] <jlilly> N[i]X, interesting. do you have option composite 1   somewhere in your xorg.conf?
[19:00] <FOAD> jlilly: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41552/
[19:00] <Ashex> Anjzo, You can change that by going to the preferences
[19:00] <riotkittie> end0r57: if you're not using 7.10, i forget what exactly you should be looking at
[19:00] <N[i]X> jlilly: what dir is xorg.conf in?
[19:00] <lola> hi
[19:00] <loay> i have a excel xp sheet and it has a password and i want to
[19:01] <garu> ali110 what graphics do u have?
[19:01] <loay> open it at kubuntu
[19:01] <murkyMurk> /etc/X11/
[19:01] <tommykn0cker> murkyMurk: hm is there no place where this locale (and the others?.) is stored? so i can change it just once?
[19:01] <loay> how
[19:01] <Ajzo> bruenig: already had but it gives no solution - it shows that there is some plug-in missing and FILE is same way not downloading as it used to be before
[19:01] <ali110> garu: ATI built in graphics  card
[19:01] <jlilly> N[i]X, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[19:01] <Ashex> Ajzo, tools > options > content, edit filetype
[19:01] <riotkittie> ali110: more detail. which card, exactly? if you dont know ... open a terminal and lspci -vv | grep VGA -i
[19:01] <mindrape> After an upgrade to 7.10 FireFox is crashing all the time.  Is this a known bug with a workaround or has anybody else experienced this?
[19:01] <jlilly> FOAD, I might consider commenting out the option metamodes line
[19:01] <Paddy_EIRE_> Ajzo, that save function in mplayer firefox is for when the video is fully buffered/downloaded, so instead of it being removed in the firefox tmp folder it gets placed wherever you like.. or do the wget method which is far better
[19:01] <Ashex> Ajzo, that's where you want to change it's action from playing to download
[19:02] <bruenig> Ajzo, ok yeah because the file is meant to be embedded
[19:02] <vleran> ^^ FERCE
[19:02] <murkyMurk> tommykn0cker: you only need to edit the .profile fiel once. It's a permanent file read on log in. Change it there and it'll show up as a env variabel in all terminals
[19:02] <garu> alil110 "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl" (assuming ur system is up-to-date)
[19:02] <vleran> hay
[19:02] <vleran> kako si /
[19:02] <Ajzo> Ashex: it works! :*
[19:02] <troxor> kriel: if the X server is looking for a directory that isn't there, something must not have gotten installed properly
[19:02] <garu> ali110 then restart
[19:02] <end0r57> riotkittie: nothing... i should also mention that they're tar.bz2 - but i'm still able to drag and drop or use the install option. when i do so, it gives me an option to apply the new theme or keep the current theme. if i select apply new it works fine.
[19:02] <FOAD> jlilly: ok I'll try that.
[19:02] <joanki> i downloaded a codec i was missing to watch videos- what file do i put it in?
[19:02] <Ashex> Ajzo, that did it for ya?
[19:02] <kriel> troxor: is there a way to force a reinstall of the entire gdm?
[19:02] <Ajzo> Ashex: Edit -> Preferences -> Content -> change... bla bla bla and it works ! :D
=== jared is now known as KI4IKL
[19:02] <loay> im ask you plz
[19:02] <ali110> garu : i will try that
[19:03] <kriel> troxor: ... nevermind. -goes to hunt down man page-

[19:03] <Ajzo> Ashex: i'm gonna change it manually but it works as i can see :))
[19:03] <riotkittie> end0r57: hmm. i'm not sure, sorry :|
[19:03] <Ashex> Ajzo, heh, no problem
[19:03] <end0r57> okay cool... thanks
[19:03] <Ajzo> thanks a lot guys for help ;)
[19:03] <jessie^^> where are the themed icons kept for the volume control?
[19:03] <N[i]X> jlilly: where in the file? cant find it
[19:03] <garu> I got libdvdcss2 intalled, how do I install win32codecs?
[19:03] <garu> in gutsy
[19:03] <joanki> i downloaded a codec i was missing to watch videos- what file do i put it in?
[19:03] <joanki> what do i do with it?
[19:03] <Fryguy--> garu: check out medibuntu
[19:03] <riotkittie> !info win32codecs
[19:03] <ubotu> Package win32codecs does not exist in gutsy
[19:03] <Ashex> Ajzo, you can also set it up to use a specific app for downloading by telling it to use such and such app
[19:03] <Paddy_EIRE_> !win32codecs | garu
[19:03] <riotkittie> :O
[19:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about win32codecs - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

[19:03] <beni> garu: Applications -> Add / remove -> seach for codecs
[19:03] <Paddy_EIRE_> hmm
[19:04] <joanki> jrib,  what does that mean
[19:04] <_blitz_> how do i get Beryl to load when Feisty starts?
[19:04] <Gin> joakim-, you don't really download codecs yourself. vlc play almost all video files
[19:04] <loay> what is a grep
[19:04] <Ajzo> Ashex: yeap, i know ;)
[19:04] <BaD_CrC> !w32codecs | garu
[19:04] <ubotu> garu: Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages, including the win32 codecs: see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - See also !Codecs
[19:04] <jrib> joanki: read the private message from ubotu
[19:04] <riotkittie> _blitz_: add beryl to your startup in sessions
[19:04] <tommykn0cker> murkyMurk: hm yeah but for me it looks like the system starts every time with the "old" variable and on the log on overwrites it every time. isnt it a bit.. circuitous?
[19:04] <Gin> joakim-, if no, try movie player, it will download the codecs itself
[19:04] <man> Hey anybody want to talk
[19:04] <garu> beni Fryguy Paddy_EIRE thanks
[19:04] <garu> BaD_CrC thanks
[19:04] <jlilly> N[i]X, it might not be in there?
[19:04] <kane77> bashish doesn't work on my desktop.. it works on my laptop.. but here it only displays garbage characters...
[19:04] <BaD_CrC> :)
[19:05] <Skratz0r_> Where can I download the PPC LIVE CD? (of Gusty)
[19:05] <N[i]X> jlilly: i tried to search for "composite" and nothing was found
[19:05] <troxor> kriel: gdm is simply the process that fires off X server processes- you want to make sure doing something like `X :1` will work
[19:05] <loay> man how are u
[19:05] <N[i]X> jlilly: no it is not there
[19:05] <shnops> всем по привету
[19:05] <troxor> kriel: else, gdm will continue to choke
=== guest_ is now known as SaSav
[19:05] <riotkittie> errr. i thought PPC support stopped with uhmm... errr. ahhh.
[19:05] <linuxlover>  
[19:06] <Skratz0r_> they stopped PPC support?! :O
[19:06] <N[i]X> jlilly, brb, 10 mins ....   write what you think i should do and i'll read it later... thx
[19:06] <troxor> kriel: to simplify the problem, stop gdm, with `/etc/init.d/gdm stop`, then `startx`
[19:06] <Hazler> Now that i got the Cube, how do i make the Cube transperant?  or see through
[19:06] <aata> who thinks this channel will break 1500 people?
[19:06] <linuxlover> Does anyone know how to access demonoid from ubuntu
[19:06] <end0r57> riotkittie: i'm getting the themes from the compiz-themes site. i'm not sure what i should be selecting there. they have several options - such as emerald, metacity, compiz, etc. perhaps that could be part of the problem? i got a theme from the compiz section. maybe i should be getting one from metacity or something. i don't know.
[19:06] <kane77> on my laptop the tty's are some kind of graphical, it's not only the text.. (or maybe it is).. how do I do this on other computer?
[19:06] <Fryguy--> Hazler: #compiz-fusion, and install compiz-settings-manager
[19:06] <jlilly> N[i]X, no idea at this point :-/
[19:06] <the_darkside_986> hi all. are there tools in the gutsy repos that allow downloading embedded objects in an html page?
[19:06] <murkyMurk> ahhhhh...not really, the variables don't exist until you log in and .profile is read first
[19:06] <endo> Just updated to Gutsy, cannot get AWN to work or compizconfig settings manager, what the heck?

[19:06] <joanki> Gin: there was one missing one that i downloaded mjyself
[19:06] <troxor> kriel: then you'll be able to see problematic output from a single X server, and be able to narrow it down easier
[19:06] <joanki> Gin: but now it sits on my desktop
[19:06] <Gin> joakim-, the thing you have downloaded. is it a .deb file?
[19:06] <FOAD> jlilly: I commented out both metamode lines and rebooted, and I'm still panning...
[19:07] <crdlb> Fryguy--, compizconfig-settings-manager
[19:07] <joanki> Gin: it's joanki where are you getting joakim
[19:07] <Skratz0r_> Yes or no question. Where can I download the PPC LIVE CD? (of Gusty)
[19:07] <endo> compizconfig-settings-manager will not open for me
[19:07] <murkyMurk> tommykn0cker: so once you've edited ~.profile you're done for life and home in time for kippers & toast
[19:07] <linuxlover> does anyone know how to access demonoid from firefox in ubuntu
[19:07] <Hazler> fryguy-- i have that
[19:07] <joanki> Gin: .dll
[19:07] <Gin> joanki, sory, stupid xchat auto complete ;)
[19:07] <Hazler> fryguy-- wait....
[19:07] <tommykn0cker> murkyMurk: ahm alright ill try it out, thx
[19:07] <riotkittie> ohhhhhh end0r57. ok. and these themes end in like .compiz or .cwgd or somethinG ?
[19:07] <Gin> joanki, you can't use .dll on Linux
[19:07] <troxor> Skratz0r_: yes
[19:07] <Skratz0r_> Oh dear

[19:08] <Skratz0r_> Oh wait
[19:08] <garu> BaD_CrC how do I go about installing that?
[19:08] <beni> Is there something like scp for streaming multimedia files or files in general? I mean both ends are authenticated and the traffic is encrypted, or should I look for a VPN solution?

[19:08] <monk> how do i alt tab from a game , it doesnt work the way windows does
[19:08] <_i_> Hello
[19:08] <Skratz0r_> was...
[19:08] <Gin> joanki, did you try to play the video with vlc?
[19:08] <crdlb> end0r57, the compiz themes are for the ancient CGWD which is long gone, so either use beryl themes (for emerald) or metacity themes (for gtk-window-decorator)
[19:08] <kriel> troxor: and confirmed using ls... there is no file/folder there.
[19:08] <ntemis> need some help with ati grafix drivers
[19:08] <aleka> I have backed up my ~/.mozilla-thunderbird  a while ago and now I have a clean install of TB, How can I import old mail and profiles from this backup folder?
[19:09] <joanki> Gin: what is vlc
[19:09] <Skratz0r_> So its made by the community now. :|
[19:09] <kriel> so... i should reinstall x?
[19:09] <jlilly> FOAD, sorry. In the middle of busting my xorg.conf file.   I'm not really sure what to tell you man.
[19:09] <end0r57> riotkittie: they're tar.bz2 files that contain a folder named metacity-1, which contains several .png files and a couple .xml files..
[19:09] <Gin> joanki, vlc is a movie player.
[19:09] <beni> aleka: just replace the directories
[19:09] <troxor> kriel: yep
[19:09] <ntemis> help with ati drivers please
[19:09] <FOAD> Snap.  Okay, thanks for the attempted help.
[19:09] <Skratz0r_> 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon Is a community product. y/n?
[19:09] <kriel> troxor: do you have a package name handy? its easier than wading through aptitude.
[19:09] <beni> joanki: VLC is a pretty good video player which supports almost all codecs
[19:09] <murkyMurk> aleka:  just copy the old .mozilla-thunderbird file over the new one
[19:09] <aleka> beni:  Is it as simple as that?
[19:09] <[[Charlie]]> I think n.
[19:09] <monk> Does anyone here know how to alt tab from a game or a program that your using that you cannot use other programs or go to the desktop
[19:09] <joanki> Gin: someone told me to get mPlayer Movie
[19:09] <Gin> joanki, I also said that when I first get to know Ubuntu. ;) but now , it is sooo easy :)
[19:09] <troxor> kriel: xserver-xorg, at the least, iirc
[19:09] <ali110> garu : back, well it still give me the same message
[19:09] <joanki> beni: is that better than mplayer movie
[19:09] <monk> what is the key to alt tab
[19:09] <[[Charlie]]> Skratz0r_, It's official...
[19:09] <beni> aleka: yes
[19:10] <the_darkside_986> if anyone has trouble with their xorg.conf file in gutsy, they should copy their file from feisty and use it in gutsy. i've noticed some problems with the way gutsy generates xorg.conf
[19:10] <beni> joanki: definitely, try it on yourself you'll be amazed
[19:10] <Skratz0r_> Acgh
[19:10] <Paddy_EIRE_> monk, alt+tab
[19:10] <aleka> would it matter that the backup folder was 1.5x version and I am now running 2.x version of TB?
[19:10] <Gin> joanki, vlc is more userfriendly in my opinion
[19:10] <joanki> ok thx
[19:10] <Skratz0r_> It said a community Port, [[Charlie]]
[19:10] <murkyMurk> joanki: the simplest way to do what you want is to use vlc
[19:10] <Skratz0r_> So i presumed it was by the comminuty
[19:10] <FOAD> yeh if only I had a Feisty xorg.conf
[19:10] <Gin> joanki, do you know how to run a command?
[19:10] <joanki> yes
[19:10] <monk> Paddy Alt+ Tab doesnt work in all software
[19:10] <indianlinux> does anyone know how to get on demonoid.com and download torrents using ubuntu, evertime i try to download one it says that I must register, and I cant figure out how
[19:10] <joanki> so i install vlc
[19:10] <the_darkside_986> gutsy guessed my screen refresh rates wrong and improperly wrote the different screen modes
[19:10] <ntemis> vlc doesnt support greek subs
[19:10] <nanbudh> uptill now i have found gutsy to be not that good.there are screen resolution problems, firefox freezing problems and flash player installation problems
[19:10] <joanki> should i deinstall mplayer?
[19:10] <joanki> i dont need both, right
[19:10] <monk> paddy alt+tab doesnt allow me to get to desktop on linux whats the other key
[19:10] <riotkittie> i'm clueless when it comes to compiz themes. i'm not sure if compiz's theme manager still exists or if it's all handled by emerald now.
[19:10] <FOAD> indianlinux: um, just register on the site
[19:10] <Paddy_EIRE_> monk, have you tried superswitcher?
[19:10] <Ashex> aleka I don't believe it should. If it breaks, just delete the directory and restart tb
=== gnaleo is now known as Morrissey
[19:10] <monk> no
[19:10] <Gin> joanki, you don't have to
[19:10] <monk> what is superswitcher
[19:10] <beni> joanki: you may have as much players as you wish on your system
[19:11] <garu> ali110 r u using 7.10?
[19:11] <nanbudh> anybody tell me why java virtual machine is not there by default?
[19:11] <joanki> ok
[19:11] <ali110> garu : yes
[19:11] <local> Hello
[19:11] <indianlinux> foad, i cant register it says that I need a registration code
[19:11] <Fryguy--> nanbudh: it's non-free
[19:11] <end0r57> riotkittie: thanks for trying... i'll keep playing around and googling.
[19:11] <murkyMurk> indianlinux: that is nothing to do with linux, torrents work exactly teh same in all operating systems
[19:11] <Paddy_EIRE_> monk, http://code.google.com/p/superswitcher/ there is a deb there
[19:11] <Skratz0r_> Who here runs ubuntu on PPC?
[19:11] <local> i'm looking for the visual keybord in gnome, where is it ?
[19:11] <FOAD> indianlinux: well that's got nothing to do with linux
[19:11] <nanbudh> JVM is non free?
[19:11] <aleka> beni, Ashex  - Thanks!
[19:11] <nanbudh> i thought java , especially jvm is free
[19:11] <riotkittie> local: on screen keyboard?
[19:11] <the_darkside_986> there is a gpl java (diablo) but it is probably too big for the CD when they try to put more important stuff on there
[19:11] <indianlinux> but it works in windows, it wont work in linux
[19:11] <Skratz0r_> Omg. No ops? :|
[19:11] <FOAD> maybe registrations are closed there or something, I don't know
[19:11] <murkyMurk> nanbudh: free as in beer, not free as in license
[19:11] <beni> nanbudh: Java is made by a Company (SUN) and is NOT free software
[19:11] <local> riotkittie, yes
[19:12] <end0r57> hmm i thought demonoid was down
[19:12] <kriel> troxor: the one thing i dislike about linux is that it's hard to start. it's like trying to find an edge to pry up. once you get one piece free, it's a lot easier to work from there and learn more and more, but getting that first piece free and learned is hard.
[19:12] <DerDritte> Is there a way to igorne certain file types from getting into the lib in amarok?
[19:12] <Gin> BenC, didn't sun made it open source?
[19:12] <tehlaser> nanbudh: sorta.  There's icedtea, which is a free build of the JVM+class libs.
[19:12] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm
[19:12] <nanbudh> beni: i understand. thanks
[19:12] <beni> kriel: where is your problem?
[19:12] <Led_Zepplin> hey, anyone here using Wireless with Ubuntu Gutsy? What tools do you use for scanning for wireless networks?
[19:12] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, which client are you using?
[19:12] <nanbudh> please tell me then which JVM should i prefer?
[19:12] <murkyMurk> indianlinux: maybe you have a registration cookie that is valid saved in your winows browser?
[19:12] <riotkittie> local: which version are you running? i can tell you how to get to it in 7.10 but am unsure how similar this is in previous versions.
[19:12] <monk> i wonder why it takes a program for linux and it doesnt for windows
[19:12] <Skratz0r_> Does anyone here run Gusty on PPC? (Mac)
[19:12] <tehlaser> Sun is, slowly, opensourcing as much of Java as they can.
[19:12] <indianlinux> paddy firefox
[19:12] <local> iotkittie,  :)
[19:12] <garu> ali110 humn...dont really know what else to do
[19:12] <garu> :s
[19:12] <kriel> beni: that was a general statement about learning linux. right now my specific problem is my xserver isn't working
[19:12] <local> riotkittie, 7.10
[19:12] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, for downloading torrents
[19:12] <beni> DerDritte: Amarok < rhythmbox
[19:12] <troxor> kriel: higher learning curve, yes; but, the kicker is that there exists an edge :)
[19:13] <the_darkside_986> there are multiple java packages. there is the free package, diablo, but i am not sure if it is in gutsy repositories. it's in freebsd though. and there is the official non-free sun-java packages in the repos.
[19:13] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, no which client
[19:13] <Skratz0r_> Thats the problem with 1400+ preople. You never get heard.
[19:13] <ali110> garu : well thanks a lot for trying to help that was so kind :)
[19:13] <beni> kriel: Xserver problems suck.. define:"not working"
[19:13] <DerDritte> beni: That's no real help :P
[19:13] <indianlinux> paddy, azureus
[19:13] <stinkyfoot> is there anyway to upgrade from xubuntu to ubuntu 7,10 directly?
[19:13] <Skratz0r_> Does anyone here run Gusty on PPC!? (Mac)
[19:13] <gandalf> in gutsy, i have no sound in quake3 any more, although it worked fine in feisty. any idea?
[19:13] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, ah ok so what is wrong exactly
[19:13] <garu> ali110 no problem
[19:13] <nanbudh> ubuntu is usre popular. 1474 ppl WOW
[19:13] <DerDritte> beni: And since I'm on kubuntu amarok is native :D
[19:13] <beni> DerDritte: hm I mean Amarok did things i didnt want it to do and now i changed the player and are happier than with winamp
[19:13] <Skratz0r_> 1474 isn't that much... Compared to windows. wich sucks.
[19:13] <indianlinux> paddy, I can access new torrents but older ones do not let me download them
[19:13] <stinkyfoot> s there anyway to upgrade from xubuntu to ubuntu 7,10 directly?
[19:14] <Skratz0r_> Does anyone here run Gusty on PPC? (Mac)
[19:14] <troxor> stinkyfoot: xubuntu is just a superset of ubuntu- you should be able to apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[19:14] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, have you installed the java runtime environment?
[19:14] <jewbilee> how do i set up a secondary display with gutsy for my laptop?
[19:14] <kriel> troxor: beni: $sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg --reinstall    puked up with    E: sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[19:14] <gandalf> in gutsy, i have no sound in quake3 any more, although it worked fine in feisty. any idea?
[19:14] <riotkittie> local: go to System menu > Preferences > Main Menu.  Left hand column, go down to Universal Access. Enable Onboard & Onboard Settings. this will put them in the Applications Menu. alternately, launch it with ALT + F2 onboard
[19:14] <ali110> i am having problem running my desktop effects , i have installed restricted drivers and glx , what should i do ??
[19:14] <tehlaser> stinkyfoot: I don't think so.  Upgrade to xubuntu 7.10, then install ubuntu-desktop.
[19:14] <Gin>  gandalf for that kind of problem, I suggest searching the forum or make a post there
[19:14] <DerDritte> beni: I think amarok is nice... I'm a bit of a media-junkie...
[19:14] <Morrissey> Hi! I am trying to install kubuntu 7.10 on a 64 bits ASUS A8N-E, with two disks on RAID .. with chipset nForce4 ... graphic card: Radeon X800XL ... but instantly when I press "Start or install kubuntu", it loads the kernel, and then the machine freezes ... no input on keyboard is going trhough or nothing (such as caps, numlock, ctrl-alt-del ...) ... any ideas?
[19:14] <stinkyfoot> tehlaser how do i upgrade to xubuntu 7,10
[19:14] <beni> kriel: Are you doint this from your rescue system or what?
[19:14] <riotkittie> ali110: you should lspci | grep VGA -i in a term and tell me which card you are using.
[19:14] <Paddy_EIRE_> indianlinux, sorry I dont know what you mean.. if its an older torrent the tracker most likely has changed that is if you are trying to use an old torrent file
[19:14] <kriel> troxor: beni: i have a sneaking suspicion that i have conflicting processes going on...
[19:15] <stinkyfoot> and will it include all the things that regular ubuntu has?
[19:15] <DerDritte> beni: gotta go anyway.

[19:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about python - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[19:16] <nortcele> hello folks, i just upgraded to gutsy and my audio stutters now. it worked just fine in fiesty
[19:16] <nortcele> any ideas
[19:16] <kriel> troxor: can you give those to me in a little more verbose format?
[19:17] <Gin> joanki, did you restart firefox?
[19:17] <beni> kriel: why are you making easy things difficult? No chance to just insert the livecd and install from scratch?
[19:17] <nanbudh> firefox is giving me choice of iced tea jre. i assume it is good?
[19:17] <beni> nanbudh: yes, install it :)
[19:17] <troxor> kriel: `apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg && apt-get install xserver-xorg
[19:17] <tehlaser> iced tea isn't exactly stable, but it's free.
[19:17] <ali110> riotkittie : /usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Fatal: Support for non power of two textures missing
[19:17] <ali110> /usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Error: Failed to manage screen: 0
[19:17] <ali110> /usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Fatal: No manageable screens found on display :1.0
[19:17] <urthmover> finally mail-notification wirk right for me
[19:17] <flick> where can i download a windows like explorer for ubuntu? the natutilus doesn't seem as powerful
[19:17] <urthmover> works
[19:17] <nanbudh> beni:thanks .started it. now how about flash.
[19:17] <Skratz0r_> garu, join #python on undernet.
[19:17] <beni> flick: LOL
[19:17] <riotkittie> ali110: ew. in that case, i have no idea. which driver are you using? restricted?
[19:17] <urthmover> what do you want a filemanager to do that nautilus can't?
[19:18] <beni> nanbudh: visit youtube.com and you will be prompted to install it
[19:18] <flick> beni, i'm serious :)
[19:18] <kriel> beni: because the cdrom on this computer is slower than sh*t. it took me two hours to install just the text-only version. trying to install over network, and not doing well.
[19:18] <kriel> troxor: trying.
[19:18] <garu> can someone tell me if gutsy gibbon is working fine with wpa encripted wireless networks out of the box?or do I have to change anything?
[19:18] <aleka> Beni, Ashex: I did "/cp /media/sda1/Backup/rsync/habtamu/.mozilla-thunderbird/  /home/habtamu/.mozilla-thunderbird/" and got a message cp: omitting directory `/media/sda1/Backup/rsync/habtamu/.mozilla-thunderbird/'... did it do what I wanted it to do ?
[19:18] <garu> Skratz0r thanks
[19:18] <beni> kriel: no chance to plug it on the net for some hours?
[19:18] <riotkittie> urthmover: the ability to juggle puppies and chainsaws would be nice. thats what i want from a file manager.
[19:18] <troxor> garu: depends on the wireless card; it worked fine for my sort-of old bcm43xx and madwifi based cards
[19:18] <nanbudh> i downloaded the flash installer from adobe but on running it it errors: say 86 x 64 architecture not supported. i am on amd athlon 64.
[19:18] <ali110> riotkittie : yes if  ATI mach 8, Mach 32, Mach 64  is ristricted , i am not sure i am noob to linux
[19:19] <joanki> Beni: know how i can make vlc my default when i click a link in firefox - that it will automatically know to use vlc?
[19:19] <kishan> kriel what is installed presently on the computer
[19:19] <beni> nanbudh: *not* the adobe one, just launch firefox and surf to youtube.com
[19:19] <beni> nanbudh: firefox will prompt you to install it
[19:19] <nortcele> my audio just sounds like crap now and it worked fine before
[19:19] <le> ciao
[19:19] <nanbudh> beni: okays
[19:19] <Flannel> nanbudh: adobe doesn't have a 64bit flash, you need to use gnash
[19:19] <le> !list
[19:19] <ubotu> I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[19:19] <kriel> kishan: the text-only install off the cd and (supposedly) gdm
[19:19] <beni> joanki: perhaps a setting in vlcplayer, dunno
[19:19] <the_darkside_986> gnash is supposed to work with youtube. but i had trouble using it with games the last time i tried it
[19:19] <ali110> riotkittie : yes if  ATI mach 8, Mach 32, Mach 64  is ristricted , i am not sure i am noob to linux
[19:19] <the_darkside_986> it ran this one game just fine though...
[19:19] <garu> troxor I thought that, if the wireless works fine, it wouldnt matter what kind of encryption u have :o
[19:20] <kishan> do u have a problem installing kriel
[19:20] <kriel> beni: not really. my parents go nutjob on me if i leave my compy on overnight.
[19:20] <riotkittie> ali110: i have no idea why it isnt working.   :|
[19:20] <kkathman> urthmover,  would be kinda nice if you could split panes like konq for instance
[19:20] <ali110> riotkittie : thanks for your try to help
[19:20] <RequinB4> i have a few problems - gimme a shout if you can help with:  sound bad (need sda_hda_intel module apparently); pidgin can't connect; getting my window theme back on gutsy
[19:20] <Do0oDz> hello
[19:21] <Do0oDz> have anyone installed VMware ?
[19:21] <Paddy_EIRE_> gnome-commander is great kkathman
[19:21] <kriel> troxor: puked up with unmet dependencies, saying that xserver-xorg isnt even installed. is there any way to do a copy/paste using only tty lines?
[19:21] <troxor> garu: it's a safer answer than 'of course!' and then have your wireless card not work :) but yes, in general, it should be fine, provided the card's hardware supports wpa
[19:21] <nortcele> RequinB4: im having the same sound problems
[19:21] <wolferine> can someone help me setup my dual display correctly? (im using an Nvidia card) no !triggers are necessary, I have experience
[19:21] <riotkittie> RequinB4: have you modprobed snd_hda_intel ?
[19:21] <Mishaal> does anyone know how to copy ubuntu 7.10 from torrent to nero? i am using Windows just now :(
[19:21] <kishan> http://www.howtoforge.com/unetbootin_windows_ubuntu_fedora check this out if u have problems installing with ur cd room kreil
[19:21] <RequinB4> riotkittie - yeah but fatal doesn't exist error i get
[19:21] <troxor> kriel: depends on your needs `screen` has copy/paste functionality
[19:22] <Burlynn> gutsy is awesome!
[19:22] <garu> RequinB4 is it no sound or low sound?
[19:22] <RequinB4> no sound
[19:22] <wolferine> Mishaal, matters what you downloaded in the .torrent
[19:22] <kriel> Mishaal: do you have the .iso file there? nero should readily accept that.
[19:22] <nortcele> For me its stuttering sound.
[19:22] <the_darkside_986> the torrent should result in an iso file once done downloading. nero should be able to burn the iso if it is not a crippled version
[19:22] <Gin> Mishaal, copy to nero? why would you do that? don't think that makes sense. can you tell us what you want to do?
[19:22] <Paddy_EIRE_> !sound | RequinB4
[19:22] <ubotu> RequinB4: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[19:22] <kriel> troxor: kay. one sec, $man screen
[19:22] <nanbudh> beni:did u mean gnash swf player?
[19:22] <RequinB4> been through all of that i've had this problem since august
[19:22] <beni> !ati | beni
[19:22] <nanbudh> beni : did u mean gnash player
[19:22] <Skratz0r_> Nearly at 1500, whoever wondered wether we'd top it
[19:23] <TheRepacker> Burlynn, but a little crazy write now with thia new release
[19:23] <Skratz0r_> :D
[19:23] <riotkittie> Gin: i think they want to burn the ISO
[19:23] <beni> nanbudh: yes, install it
[19:23] <nanbudh> okay thanks
[19:23] <garu> RequinB4 is your problem no sound or low sound?
[19:23] <Mishaal> Gin: i want to copy it to CD :(. i searched in google but i couln'd find :(
[19:23] <RequinB4> apparently the problem is i need sda_hda_intel but 'modprobe sda_hda_intel' gives me a fatal error
[19:23] <RequinB4> garu - no sound
[19:23] <riotkittie> Mishaal: you have downloaded the ISO?
[19:23] <troxor> kriel: screen's great, but it's got a learning curve to it too... basically, you'll do ^A <esc>, then move the cursor to the start point.. <spacebar> to set beginning, then same business for the end point.. to paste, ^A ]
[19:23] <kriel> troxor: argh. okay. cant run screen (not installed) and can't install (unmet dependencies)
[19:23] <Mishaal> yes riotkittie
[19:23] <the_darkside_986> if u have the free crippled Nero, then you should do a google search for a free or trial CD burner program
[19:23] <TtyS2> hi
[19:24] <Paddy_EIRE_> Mishaal, use imgburn
[19:24] <Gin> Mishaal, do you know where the ubuntu iso file is?
[19:24] <riotkittie> Mishaal: open up nero,  [i forget where on the menu it is, maybe third of fourth one in?] and select Burn Image
[19:24] <flick> hi... can someone please suggest a more powerful file manager? thanks
[19:24] <urthmover> I like Active@ Iso Recorder (its freeware) for windows
[19:24] <rambo3> RequinB4: snd_hda_intel
[19:24] <kishan> mishaal http://www.howtoforge.com/unetbootin_windows_ubuntu_fedora
[19:24] <kriel> troxor: and for some reason tty2-3 locked up after i ran $logout ...
[19:24] <Mishaal> yes Gin
[19:24] <shooood> mrjoey> hi
[19:24] <Paddy_EIRE_> Mishaal, http://www.imgburn.com/
[19:24] <TtyS2> i am looking for a messenger that can be used with yahoo but in terminal not in gui

[19:24] <kishan> mishaal sorry about the earlier link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[19:24] <aclark> i just updated to 7.10 and now when i got to desktop effects i get an error saying composite extension is missing, is this something with compiz?
[19:24] <nanbudh> BTW what happened to galeon and gaim?
[19:24] <kishan> check this  how to burn
[19:24] <rambo3> RequinB4: modprobe snd-hda-intel
[19:24] <Paddy_EIRE_> Mishaal, its free small and easy to use
[19:24] <wolferine> can someone help me setup my dual display correctly? (im using an Nvidia card) no !triggers are necessary, I have experience
[19:25] <N[i]X> any1 know how to disactivate the new graphic effects on the ubuntu upgrade?
[19:25] <garu> how do Install jdk 6.3 and netbeans in ubuntu?
[19:25] <Paddy_EIRE_> wolferine, we can determine that
[19:25] <riotkittie> TtyS2: there's finch, which is the text based version of Pidgin
[19:25] <Gin> Mishaal, here is a guide. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#head-5f36c46dbbdd2bd773ae1f5d361be66c6553babf
[19:25] <Mishaal> thanks kishan and Paddy_EIRE_ :)
[19:25] <nanbudh> garu: order a cd from sun
[19:25] <RequinB4> rambo3 - ok that worked, but still no sound
[19:25] <jburd> I'm wondering why performance becomes sluggish on Gutsy after a while?
[19:25] <RequinB4> let me check sound options
[19:25] <TtyS2> riotkittie: thanks
[19:25] <michael_> just wondering if people here actually know how to google...
[19:25] <the_darkside_986> @N[i]X it is under the System > Preferences > Appearance. should be the last tab in that dialog
[19:25] <rambo3> RequinB4: run speaker-test
[19:26] <nanbudh> garu: you could also download from their site
[19:26] <Burlynn> google? whats that? ;p
[19:26] <wolferine> Paddy_EIRE_, want to assist, possibly?
[19:26] <michael_> :)
[19:26] <murkyMurk> N[i]X: there is a menu option under Apperarance
[19:26] <Ashex> aw dang, Aleki left
[19:26] <garu> nanbudh order a cd?why can't it be installed like in anyother distro?like, downloading from sun and then installing it?
[19:26] <Ashex> er
[19:26] <Ashex> aleka, cp -rf
[19:26] <riotkittie> jburd: you runnning compiz?
[19:26] <Paddy_EIRE_> wolferine, sorry I dont use nvidia myself I use ati
[19:26] <michael_> so then try it garu?
[19:26] <flick> hi, where can i get a gui based file manager for linux more powerful than nautilus?
[19:26] <Ashex> aleka, needs to be recursive
[19:26] <aclark> i just updated to 7.10 and now when i got to desktop effects i get an error saying composite extension is missing, is this something with compiz?
[19:26] <RequinB4> rambo3 ok well that might do something - error - missing alsa library
[19:26] <wolferine> thats too bad Paddy_EIRE_ :)
[19:26] <kishan> is there any other search enginge better than google
[19:26] <jburd> riotkittie: Yup.
[19:26] <N[i]X> the_darkside_986, murkymurk: i know, it is set to "none" but i still have effects when windows close and open
[19:26] <RequinB4> though i updated
[19:26] <jburd> riotkittie: Is that a problem?
[19:26] <riotkittie> flick: can you elaborate on more powerful?
[19:26] <nanbudh> garu: ofcourse it can be downloaded. the only thing is if you have a small bandwidth issue
[19:26] <techly> What package is the mouse theme in?
[19:27] <murkyMurk> flick: konqueror
[19:27] <RequinB4> rambo i'll check synapic
[19:27] <garu> nanbudh oh, ok!in sabayon I had to install jdk before installing netbeans, but I used emerge sun-jdk...I dont know how to do it in ubuntu
[19:27] <Paddy_EIRE_> wolferine, although there are many guides on the ubuntu wiki and the ubuntu forums which are very well written
[19:27] <the_darkside_986> @N[i]X did you reset X server? try Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
[19:27] <wolferine> Paddy_EIRE_, obviously :)
[19:27] <troxor> kriel: you can always go single user mode, but.. you shouldn't have to to simply install stuff
[19:27] <murkyMurk> N[i]X: weird. even post re-boot?
[19:27] <rambo3> RequinB4: do you have alsa-base installed?
[19:27] <garu> nanbudh nah...no problems with downloading anything here :)
[19:27] <jburd> riotkittie: Does running compiz make the desktop sluggish?
[19:27] <Paddy_EIRE_> wolferine, always check there before asking here
[19:27] <wolferine> Paddy_EIRE_, that is why everyone attempts to try Ubuntu
[19:28] <RequinB4> rambo3 - i did before upgrade double checking now
[19:28] <flick> riotkittie, for instance i would like to see the name of the current folder
[19:28] <kriel> troxor: ew. new problem. startx now pukes up with        could not open default font (fixed)   fatal IO error 104
[19:28] <riotkittie> jburd: it seems to cause sluggishness for some people after a while. i cant say it's your problem, tho.
[19:28] <N[i]X> i tried
[19:28] <RequinB4> rambo-3 alsa-base and all its dependancies that i can tell are installed
[19:28] <N[i]X> but it doesnt work
[19:28] <riotkittie> flick: erm. cant you do that now?
[19:28] <N[i]X> still gives me graphic effects
[19:28] <Flannel> flick: You can turn on the address bar, or whatever
[19:28] <flick> riotkittie, preview tooltips if possible, tree on the left
[19:28] <the_darkside_986> i tried running compiz but 3d games like sauerbraten kept shrinking to windowed mode instead of fullscreen, and it would freeze up. :(
[19:29] <rambo3> RequinB4: ok , try installing oss wrapper , i think its called alsa-oss
[19:29] <flick> riotkittie, oh i can? sorry let me check up on it... i think that's what i wnat most for now (address bar)
[19:29] <troxor> kriel: progress :)  install xfonts-base, or just xfonts-*
[19:29] <Mishaal> kishan: if i follow the first link, will it let me install 2 operating systems directly ??
[19:29] <riotkittie> brb
[19:29] <[Al]> You know how bash knows what filetypes are applicable to the command you're trying to run? Well, how do you add a filetype? Currently, mplayer isn't associated with .divx, meaning I can't tab-complete .divx files.
[19:29] <flick> riotkittie, and the tree view on left
[19:29] <RB2> I applied a GDK theme while FireFox was running (and Use System Colors was unchecked) and now the "Use System Colors" settings has no effect. Any suggestions?
[19:30] <kriel> troxor: oh dear god... 327MB of fonts? O.o;
[19:30] <RequinB4> rambo3 ok installed
[19:30] <murkyMurk> N[i]X: sudo apt-get remove compiz
[19:30] <end0r57> how can i play .rm files?
[19:30] <kishan> mishaal noo u need to install seperatly

[19:30] <troxor> kriel: I believe -base is the only one you need, but the foolproof way is just to install them all :)

[19:31] <michal> bye all
[19:31] <Mishaal> kishan: stupid Windows
[19:31] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, you should not recommend wubi... it is not officially supported
[19:31] <murkyMurk> Tornado: you will find chgrp and chuser and chmod helpful
[19:32] <kishan> Paddy_EIRE_, its not wubi
[19:32] <Tornado> Flannel: I set up a web server and I need to change the permissions to the www folder and apache folder so i can make changes...
[19:32] <murkyMurk> Tornado: lol, not chuser chown
[19:32] <Tornado> yea i need the chmod command
[19:32] <Tornado> ...
[19:32] <RequinB4> rambo3 - i dont think that command should stall terminal?
[19:32] <N[i]X> murkymurk: same thing

[19:35] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, this is a much better guide http://apcmag.com/node/5162/
[19:35] <Mishaal> will it work with XP kishan ?
[19:35] <troxor> kriel: links or lynx?
[19:35] <Tornado> murkyMurk: Yea, that's why i'm asking... I type "chmod" then what?
[19:35] <kamelot> can someone help me with something?
[19:35] <Paddy_EIRE_> Mishaal, http://apcmag.com/node/5162/  <-- follow this and choose which one is right for you
[19:36] <Tornado> man i thought this was a help channel, people just say i know how to do it but you dont... real nice.
[19:36] <ompaul> !anyone | kamelot
[19:36] <ubotu> kamelot: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[19:36] <kishan> mishaal best thing is burn the cd and try
[19:36] <kkathman> Tornado,   type    man chmod   and it will tell you the options
[19:36] <murkyMurk> Tornado: that depends entriely on what you want to do,,type man chmod
[19:36] <kriel> troxor: ... i completely forgot about text-based browsers.
[19:36] <vocx> Tornado, what's your real question? Changing permissions without know its consequences might be bad.
[19:36] <N[i]X> murkymurk: same thing
[19:36] <zewb> lol
[19:36] <Ashfire908> what will happen if i'm downloading the updates to upgrade to 7.10 and the internet connection resets?
[19:36] <sutabi> I am having a lil issue. I clicked update to 7.10 and now the update manager froze and has been for the last 30 mins, should I kill it?

[19:37] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:37] <kkathman> Tornado,  if you just wanna change the folder thats one thing - if you want to change everything in it thats another
[19:37] <kishan> mishaal its very easy u can do it
[19:37] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:37] <shooood> anyone know how to partition a new hard disk ?????????????
[19:37] <RequinB4> rambo3 anything else?  I'm stumped at this point if modprobe fails me
[19:37] <Tornado> kkathman: I want to change a folder so I have full write/read priveleges to it and everything in it... been using linux for 2 days... man
[19:37] <murkyMurk> N[i]X: i'm at a loss, with out compiz you shouldn't have any effects
[19:37] <troxor> sutabi: before you do, check if there are any defunct dpkg processes, by doing `ps aux | grep dpkg`
[19:37] <lauchazombie> shooood, try with gparted is very easy
[19:37] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:38] <Box|UK> Mishaal:  i burned the live cd as an iso  went to bios set bios to start from cd and  enjoyed the experience
[19:38] <kishan> mishaal donnot get confused ok first burn the cd ok
[19:38] <murkyMurk> Tornado: chmod 777 <directory> -R
[19:38] <jolson> josys36
[19:38] <nanbudh> guys i now need a shockwave player. please suggest which one to install

=== jolson is now known as josys36
[19:38] <N[i]X> murkymurk: i dunno its just when i open a window or close one
[19:38] <kkathman> Tornado,  ok, great, you should learn the "man" command... it will give you "help" on any line command   use it with chmod and type   man  chmod  at a terminal line and you'll see
[19:38] <Tornado> murkyMurk: Doesn't work...
[19:38] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:38] <Ashfire908> what will happen if i'm downloading the updates to upgrade to 7.10 and the internet connection resets? will it hurt my system?
[19:38] <unimatrix9> Seveas
[19:38] <stemount> there isn't shockwave for linux is there?
[19:38] <Mishaal> yesssssssssss kishan ;)
[19:38] <nn> time to upgrade to gutsy soon, huh?
[19:38] <rambo3> RequinB4:  whats in : ls /proc/asound/card0
[19:38] <kishan> nanbudh, i am sorry no shockwave in ubuntu
[19:38] <N[i]X> murkymurk: and it gives me problems when scrolling down a webpage
[19:38] <troxor> sutabi: ok, that's good- you probably should give it some time, especially if it's writing to disk..
[19:38] <kkathman> Tornado,  and of course, remember if you use chmod you'll need to precede with  sudo
[19:39] <nn> stemount: its called flash iirc
[19:39] <nanbudh> kishan: its been like this since 2 years now :<
[19:39] <manopulus> hi. installed xubuntu 7.10 and totem does not play mp3 and almost all videos. what i have to install to play?
[19:39] <kishan> u can try it wine but not sure nanbudh
[19:39] <rambo3> RequinB4:  whats in : cat /proc/asound/card0/
[19:39] <nn> Ashfire908: no, you can restart the download
[19:39] <nn> Ashfire908: it wont install packages until they're all downloaded
[19:39] <nanbudh> is there no alternative?
[19:39] <RequinB4> ls /../ is "codec#0  id  oss_mixer  pcm0c  pcm0p  pcm1p
[19:39] <RequinB4> "
[19:39] <sutabi> troxor: ok thanks
[19:39] <murkyMurk> Tornado: apols chmod -R 777 <directory>   getting my -R mixed up
[19:39] <wolferine> how can you display a current screens resolution ?
[19:39] <Paddy_EIRE_> nanbudh, no

[19:39] <vocx> !man > Tornado
[19:39] <nanbudh> my nephew needs it for online games
[19:39] <kishan> nanbudh, i think no......virtualize windows may be lol
[19:40] <kamelot> dus anybody else have a bad internet connettion with gutsy gibbon
[19:40] <percival> hellow --- I am trying to test Ubuntu on my gateway tablet cx2724, but it freezes at 71% loading from the live CD, can anyone tell me were to get info on how to solve this?
[19:40] <kkathman> murkyMurk,   he'll need to use sudo I imagine
[19:40] <Paddy_EIRE_> nanbudh, there is no alternative
[19:40] <RequinB4> rambo3 cat command says ...: is a directory
[19:40] <Ashfire908> nn: ok. do i have to manually restart do-release-upgrade?
[19:40] <nanbudh> paddy_eire: thats too bad
[19:40] <vocx> nanbudh, it is very sad that your nephew needs it for online games...
[19:40] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:40] <lauchazombie> does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:40] <rambo3> RequinB4: no need , there should be snd-intel-hda there . so its not loading for the card
[19:40] <kom0dor> Is it ok to install a feisty package on 7.10?
[19:40] <RoC_MasterMind> percival, reboot, then choose "check CD for defects".
[19:40] <lauchazombie> sorry the flood does some has managed to fix azureus?
[19:40] <kishan> nanbudh, many good games in ubuntu toooo ask him to try those
[19:40] <jdong> lauchazombie: please stop
[19:41] <kom0dor> I know it messes things up the other way, not sure if it'd be ok
[19:41] <aleka> How do I disable the blue pop up boxes (notification boxes) that come up in Gutsy??
[19:41] <percival> I did it also freezes at 71% when checking cd
[19:41] <jdong> lauchazombie: all progress is detailed on the launchpad bug report, and asking 3 times in 10 seconds does not help
[19:41] <Paddy_EIRE_> nanbudh, if you are experienced a little and have a powerful enough system you can set up windows 2000 or something in a Virtual Machine if that is all he requires
[19:41] <kst-> hey i'm thinking about upgrading from feisty to gutsy, actually i already UPGRADED but now i want to do a clean reinstall. I got my home partition separated but now I wonder if I should remove/uninstall anything before formatting + installing a clean new gutsy install?
[19:41] <lauchazombie> jdong, sorry
[19:41] <nanbudh> hmm..i will have to now. i was somehow thinking that 7.10 would have something about it. but one cannot have everything
[19:41] <RequinB4> rambo3 fyi i have two mixers, ALSA and OOS, not quite sure atm which is 0 and 1
[19:41] <rambo3> RequinB4: check : dmesg | grep  hda
[19:41] <lauchazombie> jdong, i dont want to use automatix so im kinda frustrated, again sorry i know the nettiquete
[19:41] <kst-> !upgrade
[19:41] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[19:41] <kom0dor> heh
[19:42] <RoC_MasterMind> kst-, if you are doing a clean uninstall, you don't need to change anything ...it will get wiped out.
[19:42] <carlos> spanish people
[19:42] <jdong> lauchazombie: you can manually unpack Azureus from their site, to your home directory, and remove ~/.azureus and it runs perfectly
[19:42] <Paddy_EIRE_> nanbudh, http://www.virtualbox.org/
[19:42] <carlos> please
[19:42] <vocx> kst-, when you do clean install you format the partition so no point in removing or adding anything to it.
[19:42] <astro76> !es | carlos
[19:42] <ubotu> carlos: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[19:42] <lauchazombie> jdong, thanks
[19:42] <kst-> RoC_MasterMind does that include stuff like compiz settings etc? i already have it since feisty..
[19:42] <jdong> lauchazombie: the packaging in Ubuntu is not fixed yet, and few developers have a clear understanding of exactly what's wrong with it
[19:42] <flake> for kde/compiz, should I go with screenlets, adesklets, gdesklets, ..  ?
[19:42] <kst-> vocx some settings are saved in my $HOME i think?
[19:42] <nanbudh> paddy_eire: thanks ill check it out
[19:42] <kishan> nanbudh, if u can try virtualization of windows
[19:42] <RequinB4> rambo3 in terminal that gives no output
[19:42] <rambo3> RequinB4: check : dmesg | grep  intel
[19:42] <lauchazombie> jdong, is a really old bug i think it is since edgy
[19:42] <vocx> kst-, ...of course you do not need to format $HOME...
[19:42] <XXer> Anyone know if I can use Ghost to back up ubuntu and if not, some other app that will do the same thing
[19:43] <RoC_MasterMind> kst-, your personal settings are stored in your home directory
[19:43] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, better the other way around
[19:43] <Omnius> G'day, i edited my menu and now the drop down app menu is empty and the menu manager wont start
[19:43] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, have windows as the guest
[19:43] <rambo3> RequinB4: it should . "dmesg |grep intel " without ""
[19:43] <kst-> yeah RoC_MasterMind and that does include compiz stuff, doesnt it? what else is there that might possibly ruin a new install?
[19:43] <flick> how can i turn on an address bar, and have a tree view on the left on Nautilus?
[19:43] <RequinB4> rambo3 - copyright msg, then next line "intel_rng: FWH not detected"
[19:43] <jdong> lauchazombie: not entirely accurate, I'm a bit involved with the packaging and it's been on-and-off working/not-working
[19:43] <kishan> Paddy_EIRE_, i donnot have much exper in virtualiation becoz i have low ram now if i get a new one i will try it out that
[19:43] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, http://www.virtualbox.org/
[19:44] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, great stuff
[19:44] <jdong> lauchazombie: recently it seems like something is wrong with the GNU GCJ java stack that is producing incorrect Java bytecode, and none of us around here really understand that toolchain...
[19:44] <EminX> in 7.10, can't install vga drivers
[19:44] <flake> anyone type anything to me
[19:44] <lauchazombie> jdong, thanks for the help
[19:44] <kishan> Paddy_EIRE_, can i run it on 512 ram
[19:44] <vocx> !patience > flake
[19:44] <jdong> lauchazombie: looks like it has to be compiled with Sun Java to work, but Ubuntu policies currently do not allow for that
[19:44] <lauchazombie> jdong, i had read that changin the machine may work in some cases
[19:44] <astro76> flick, 1) click the icon to the left of the location/button bar to toggle, 2) click Places and you will get a dropdown menu, select Tree
[19:44] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, well it would run.. but might be quite sluggish
[19:44] <murkyMurk> flake: anything
[19:44] <kom0dor> if I install a feisty package on 7.10 will it hose dependencies?
[19:44] <John117> Hey everybody.  I'm installing Ubuntu on my XP machine as a dual boot.    IF i want to uninstall ubuntu later, how do I remove GRUB?  Is there a tutorial to read?
[19:45] <astro76> kom0dor, you don't want to do that
[19:45] <EminX> The software source for the package
[19:45] <EminX>    nvidia-glx
[19:45] <EminX>  is not enabled.
[19:45] <RoC_MasterMind> kst-, you delete your personal settings...they are all stored in named directoryies prefixed with a dot (normally hidden).  if you view the "Hidden" files/directories in your home directory you'll see things like ".mozilla"
[19:45] <kom0dor> alright, did it the other way once and regretted it, the app isn't open source :/
[19:45] <gunashekar> can someone help? I am getting "dependency problems " error when i install updates ,
[19:45] <else> anyone using pureftpd with virtual users? can't login at all, always getting "530 authentication failed"
[19:45] <vocx> kom0dor, what do you want to install that is not available?
[19:45] <flick> astro76, thanks a lot!
[19:45] <jdong> lauchazombie: unfortunately not in this case... last release GCJ worked but Sun Java crashed, this release BOTH crash.
[19:45] <flake> sorry, think Pideon is dropping text
[19:45] <kishan> did u try it Paddy_EIRE_
[19:46] <nn> Downloading DVD image.. if i want to install BOTH servers and desktops from one CD, do i really need both server and desktop images?

[19:46] <claudio75> hi to all...i'm italian and i've tried so many times to solve my problem in ubuntu-it irc channel but without results...so i'm here hopeing that you'll solve it...i've bought my fourth webcamera...and it's not working as the other 3....it's a trust wb-1200p ...it should be ubuntu compatible and it should work with spca5xx driver.....but it's not working....please me help me!!! ah...i'm sorry for my poor english
[19:46] <murkyMurk> John117: there would be no need to but if you wanted to then you would just reinstall the XP boot manager to the MBR which is clearly detailed on ms webby
[19:46] <lauchazombie> jdong, in this kind of situation i fell bad for not know how to code and help...well bug reporting is a good way to help too :P
[19:46] <astro76> nn, it's all on the DVD
[19:46] <EminX> any help, cant enable vga driver
[19:46] <kom0dor> ah, actually nevermind, found a .deb for it from debian repos.
[19:46] <astro76> nn, but with the CDs, yes  you would need both
[19:46] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, yeah.. I run win 2000 in a vm with 1gb ram and amd turion 64
[19:46] <Grahik-> gnome-look down or do i have a problem with my connection ?
[19:46] <twoshadetod> what is a good app to do wordpress posting from your desktop?
[19:46] <jdong> lauchazombie: we all feel a bit bad about it... we don't really understand what is going on, a lot of our Azureus package is based off Fedora who has it working with GCJ, but their GCJ is slightly different than ours....
[19:46] <gunashekar> !dependency problems
[19:46] <RequinB4> rambo3 - "FATAL: Module snd_intel_hda not found."
[19:46] <RequinB4> rest fine

[19:47] <wolferine> xrandr Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":0.0". RandR extension missing <-- what does this error mean, and how can I repair?
[19:47] <vocx> nn, and besides usually you can turn a server into a desktop but you need to install manually other applications.
[19:47] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, although it was just for fun really I dont use windows at all anymore
[19:47] <claudio75> hi to all...i'm italian and i've tried so many times to solve my problem in ubuntu-it irc channel but without results...so i'm here hopeing that you'll solve it...i've bought my fourth webcamera...and it's not working as the other 3....it's a trust wb-1200p ...it should be ubuntu compatible and it should work with spca5xx driver.....but it's not working....please me help me!!! ah...i'm sorry for my poor english
[19:47] <Minnozz> what is 'sit0' ?
[19:47] <Paddy_EIRE_> kishan, going on 2 years
[19:47] <rambo3> RequinB4: yeah it should be snd-hda-intel by bad
[19:47] <jdong> lauchazombie: long story short it's a complicated situation and there doens't seem to be an easy fix in sight, otherwise we would've fixed it already. Just subscribe to the bug report and you'll get the latest status updates
[19:47] <RequinB4> rambo3 - heh ok
[19:47] <rambo3> RequinB4: ok test this without "" : "sudo modprobe -r snd-hda-intel && sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel && dmesg"
[19:47] <lauchazombie> jdong, is there communitacion bewteen the teams of diferent distros?

[19:48] <neosix> Hi !!!
[19:48] <nn> astro76, vocx: I was mainly curious if there's any difference in the actual packages and what not
[19:48] <astro76> !repeat | claudio75
[19:48] <ubotu> claudio75: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
[19:48] <vocx> !repeat > claudio75
[19:48] <Ghone[fark]> I'm not sure I have so much a question as need of handholding.  The feisty-Gutsy automatic upgrade didn't work, so I tried to force it and broke something.
[19:48] <neosix> How can I open port 6112
[19:48] <jdong> lauchazombie: Mepis was based off Dapper Drake
[19:48] <hunternet93> Is there a way to suspend to disk on an iBook?\
[19:48] <John117> murkymurk Thanks!  What do you mean there would be no need to?
[19:48] <jdong> lauchazombie: as I said, it *used* to work.
[19:49] <rambo3> !quickcam
[19:49] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about quickcam - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[19:49] <jdong> lauchazombie: now Mepis is based off Debian, and Debian compiles with Sun binary Java
[19:49] <claudio75> ok...i'm waiting
[19:49] <EminX> The software source for the package    nvidia-glx   is not enabled
[19:49] <ompaul> neosix, run a service on it
[19:49] <lauchazombie> jdong, very frustrating
[19:49] <EminX> The software source for the package    nvidia-glx   is not enabled

[19:49] <max7> Hello, I have compiz with desktop cube. I wish to set 4 desktops instead of 2. I already set 4 columns in Workspace Switcher Preference but there is no effect even after reboot.
[19:49] <harisgr> hi
[19:49] <Ghone[fark]> Maybe I should undo what I broke first and then give you guys a proper question?
[19:49] <astro76> nn, server CD has server packages which desktop CD doesn't
[19:49] <vocx> nn, there is a kernel for servers, and the server has packages like Lamp to deploy mail servers and stuff.
[19:49] <Paddy_EIRE_> Ghone[fark], do a fresh install in my opinion
[19:49] <beni> !info quickcam | claudio75
[19:49] <ubotu> claudio75: Package quickcam does not exist in gutsy
[19:49] <jdong> lauchazombie: indeed. well you have a workaround for now, while we try to find the correct solution
[19:49] <Paddy_EIRE_> Ghone[fark], I dont use the upgrade option ever
[19:49] <riddareralf> For two days have I tried to get my opensuse 10.3 work and I'm sick of it. Show me the light
[19:49] <hunternet93> Mass chaos.
[19:49] <neosix> Can anybody help me? I want to open port 6112
[19:50] <John117> murkymurk  I've been playing with Ubuntu and XP dual boot on my laptop.  I reached a situation where grub just continually restarted the computer.  The Ubuntu install did not complete and I couldn't boot into anything at all.  I just wanted to make sure if that happened, i could recover with another boot loader.
[19:50] <beni> riddareralf: go find the button! :)
[19:50] <kishan> riddareralf, sorry this is ubuntu channel
[19:50] <murkyMurk> John117: grub would carry on booting windows if you reformatted the linux partition..it doesn't rely on linux to work. But FIXMBR is the windows command you would use to overwrite Grub
[19:50] <riddareralf> beni, which distro? Dvd feisty?
[19:50] <EminX> do you know another irc room for 7.10 that can help me solving that problem with vga drivers
[19:50] <Topshotta> Anyone know how to edit the kernel config?

[19:50] <hunternet93> are you behind a router?
[19:50] <vocx> claudio75, how do you know the cam uses that driver? Have you tried other distributions or read something about it?

[19:50] <John117> murky murk okay!  Thanks man.
[19:50] <beni> neosix: You cant just "Open a port"! An Open Port stands for a Service / a Program listening on that specific Network-"Door" of your computer. So what do you really want to do?
[19:50] <lauchazombie> jdong, again thanks
[19:50] <MTughan> Anyone know what would be faster? Upgrading Feisty to Gutsy from the update manager, or reinstalling from an ISO?
[19:50] <wolferine> xrandr Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display ":0.0". RandR extension missing <-- what does this error mean, and how can I repair?
[19:50] <astro76> riddareralf, get the lastest 7.10 from www.ubuntu.com
[19:50] <vocx> !bot > claudio75
[19:51] <Veinor> Is anyone else having issues with openoffice?
[19:51] <flick> gnome rocks :)
[19:51] <riddareralf> astro76: will do
[19:51] <claudio75> vocx: yes...i've read it's supported
[19:51] <riddareralf> but I need a ftp
[19:51] <Topshotta> beni: do you know how to edit the kernel config?
[19:51] <rambo3> RequinB4: ?
[19:51] <vocx> wolferine, did you read the release notes on drivers?
[19:51] <Paddy_EIRE_> MTughan, whether its faster or slower a clean install is always better
[19:51] <astro76> riddareralf, there is a full list of mirrors linked after you click download
[19:51] <neosix> beni: I need to open port 6112 for Warcraft3
[19:51] <beni> riddareralf: ubuntu linux is comparable to windows xp in terms of usability. just download the LiveCD at http://ubuntu.com and put it into you cdrom drive and you may test it, and if you wish even install from this very cd
[19:51] <kishan> MTughan, reinstalling is better
[19:51] <TheRepacker> John117 there is a great page on dual booting and recovery, do a google search "dual boot pigpond"
=== csc`` is now known as csc`
[19:51] <flick> riotkittie, nautilus rocks :) thanks for pointing out i can do what i want in nautilus too... i think i assumed things too quickly, i apologize for that
[19:51] <astro76> riddareralf, you would have much better results with bittorrent in these first few days after release
[19:51] <vocx> claudio75, and where did you read that? The store that sold you? Get your money back.
[19:51] <beni> Topshotta: sorry, no
[19:52] <MTughan> Okay, will do then. It's a VM, so using an ISO isn't too hard. Thank you very much.
[19:52] <beni> neosix: okay, so you need to open the port 6112 in order to play WC3 in the battlenet?
[19:52] <Veinor> I'm using a dark theme and openoffice seems to crash every time I launch spellcheck
[19:52] <RequinB4> rambo3 - oh sry, msg before that - output is "FATAL: Module snd_hda_intel is in use."  to which i went O.o
[19:52] <nn> astro76: seems like they'd just include the metapackages on both and use something like tasksel to allow one disk to do both ;)
[19:52] <MTughan> And I know a clean install is always better, definitely for Windows. :P
[19:52] <TheRepacker> John117 actually search "dual boot bigpond"
[19:52] <function1> so, isnt networkmanager supposed to have WPA EAP support now?
[19:52] <miguel572con> hello

[19:53] <ckin2001> function1, it had it in feisty as well
[19:53] <MTughan> riddareralf: DVD just comes with more packages. CD can download those.
[19:53] <murkyMurk> TheRepacker: i preferred pigpond

[19:53] <nn> claudio75: sometimes vendors switch chipsets and dont change model #'s
[19:53] <John117> therepacker thanks.
[19:53] <beni> neosix: Do you have DSL + a router? So you may "Forward your ports" to your local computer in order to make the port accessible from the outside (=the internet)
[19:53] <kishan> Mishaal, lol ooh i c
[19:53] <astro76> nn, we're talking about what's included on the disk... on CD isn't much space so the selections have to be customized
[19:53] <TheRepacker> John117, http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/
[19:53] <beni> EminX: Where's the prob? :)

[19:53] <murkyMurk> end0r57: the app is called realplay not realplayer. it should be as easy as realplay <whatever.rm>
[19:53] <claudio75> nn: but i can see the model with lsusb...

[19:54] <end0r57> roger that
[19:54] <EminX> Anybody help plz :The software source for the package    nvidia-glx   is not enabled
[19:54] <nn> claudio75: does their cam work on -your- box?
[19:54] <nownott> everybody: i did
[19:54] <michael_> John117: yes, google.
[19:54] <RequinB4> rambo3:  explain, but probably yes
[19:54] <claudio75> nn: and i've seen people who are useing my webcam just connecting it to ubuntu without installing it
[19:54] <wolferine> vocx, thats, I guess that gives an explaination :/
[19:54] <beni> John117: I wont buy a book, the internet is the source of wisdom. nothing is written in books which is not accessible in the net. But you always got to search
[19:54] <vocx> claudio75, then ask your friends for further details. I think that is way better than going through the irc or web.  Also complain to the manufacturers or even file abug report on launchpad.
[19:54] <claudio75> nn: it works on feisty
[19:54] <thrashyy> Is there any way to burn a cd image onto a dvdr disk?

[19:55] <beni> EminX: How are you trying to install the nvidia drivers?
[19:55] <michael_> yes
[19:55] <rambo3> RequinB4: start alsamixer and check that channels are not muted  "M" . just press M key on channel
[19:55] <murkyMurk> Veinor: there is an Open Office forum that can help you..this is an Ubuntu IRC cahnnel
[19:55] <beni> !nvidia | EmniX Do it as described here
[19:55] <ubotu> EmniX Do it as described here: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[19:55] <RequinB4> rambo3 yep done that
[19:55] <nn> claudio75: ahh.. driver issue, maybe the driver was a patch against the feisty kernel
[19:55] <michael_> thrashyy: use wodim
[19:55] <Omnius> thrashyy yeah
[19:55] <paritosh> i tried to move my / partition. it keeps booting back into the old partition. what might be the problem?

[19:55] <lauchazombie> jdong, so i installed azureus with apt-get and replaced .azureus in mi home with the files in what i downloaded from their official site and still crashes
[19:55] <TheRepacker> John117, google is your best friend
[19:55] <John117> beni that is very true.  Sometimes it is difficult to get to.   Do you know of one difinitive resource with some tutorials on basic shell commands and file structure, ect?  Basic beginner stuff?

[19:55] <claudio75> nn: they're all useing that driver
[19:55] <butti> need help wile stupid
[19:55] <vocx> wolferine, I personally do not have experience with the dual head setups but I redirect everyone to read the release notes.

[19:56] <tomd123> Hey all, is there an oss tool that will let me choose an email pop account and backup all my files from that account?

[19:56] <Lejzi> does anyone have problems with kernel in gutsy ?
[19:56] <slylock> hello guys i am new to ubuntu
[19:56] <beni> EminX: thats easier for begginers
[19:56] <slylock> i wanted to know
[19:56] <beni> John117: wait
[19:56] <nn> claudio75: it could be a slight change in the driver since fiesty or maybe just driver got overlooked :)
[19:56] <claudio75> nn: i still have feisty kernel ...yes...and i'm useing it
[19:56] <slylock> which IDE is good for C++
[19:56] <butti> could anybody make correction of syntax  for me?

[19:56] <beni> slylock: there are a lot. Geany, Bluefish
[19:56] <beni> GEdit
[19:56] <tomd123> astro76: but does it download all the email's to a specific directory?
[19:56] <nn> claudio75: privmsg might be easier given the traffic here
[19:57] <John117> astro76 thanks!
[19:57] <beni> butti: tell me
[19:57] <Omnius> thrashyy michael says wodim but i did it in xp using ultraISO
[19:57] <slylock> hmmmm
[19:57] <vocx> claudio75, then use your friends' computers and see what they have. What kernel they use and what version their kernel module is. Then try to use that in your system.
[19:57] <jdong> lauchazombie: remove azureus from apt-get

[19:58] <tomd123> astro76, I want to download all my emails to a certain folder and then compress it
[19:58] <vocx> jdong, still talking about azureus? Is it really broken? I always thought it was because of the GCJ.
[19:58] <michael_> lol
[19:58] <vsayikiran> gutsy doesnt support my graphics card
[19:58] <PinkFloyd> I created a chroot jail for SSH. I downloaded a script that autocreates a jail in /home/jail/home/user but it didnt copy over Nano. I copied Nano from /bin into /home/jail/bin but when I try to load it I get this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41560/      The libncurses is in /home/jail/lib but do I need to do something else to get Nano to work in the jail?
[19:58] <michael_> i cant take this anymore
[19:58] <flick> vsayikiran, which one is it?
[19:58] <RequinB4> rambo3 - the only thing i know is that its not a hardware problem - window$ handles it fine, but i can't seem to find what the problem is for ubuntu
[19:58] <end0r57> even a folder named 'mozilla' containing the needed plug-ins (im assuming) but i can't get them to work.

[20:00] <end0r57> yes
[20:00] <hellcattrav> is it worth it to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10? and how should I go about doing it?
[20:00] <gunashekar> I am getting "dependency problems - leaving unconfigured" errors for all updates after "failed to write to cache". what could the problem be?
[20:00] <flick> vsayikiran, which graphics card is it?
[20:00] <vsayikiran> flick: after login it takes 10 min for my desktop to setup
[20:00] <vocx> jdong, after all it will be a LTS right?   But hey, who needs azureus in a LTS Server? That's just being picky.
[20:00] <stemount> apt-get install dist-upgrade hellcattrav
[20:00] <end0r57> murkyMurk: i did. it then created a new directory and extracted a bunch of files.

[20:06] <PinkFloyd> I created a chroot jail for SSH. I downloaded a script that autocreates a jail in /home/jail/home/user but it didnt copy over Nano. I copied Nano from /bin into /home/jail/bin but when I try to load it I get this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41560/      The libncurses is in /home/jail/lib but do I need to do something else to get Nano to work in the jail?

[20:09] <John117> I sure hope nvidia works with Gutsy! I know ATI sure doesn't.
[20:09] <Gosha> Does Ubuntu 6.06 get the same updates as the newer ones? Like, kernel-updates and such?

[20:09] <mic> nvidia is working fine here too
[20:10] <john_doe> how can I restart nautilus. because of a bug in 7.10 it takes all cpu, and I read that if it's restarted, I can use my cpu again. I use xfce.

[20:12] <Ghone[fark]> TheRepacker: mine are special cases.  one is a fx5200 that lost all 3d acceleration after 3 weeks because i was an FFXI addict, and the other is a TNT2 RIVA Model64, which AFAIK in not linux-friendly
[20:12] <frank23> Gosha: yeah. the kernel gets updated if a security problem is found. it's only a patch though, you don't get a recent kernel
[20:12] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: I tend to edit the xorg file directly. CAn you do that in a terminal as root?
[20:12] <vsayikiran> gutsy is terribly slow
[20:12] <frank23> Fryguy--: I want something to download video podcasts
[20:12] <mic> i cannot see any performance difference
[20:12] <Gosha> frank23: What do the other parts of the kernel do? I mean, why do they get so frequently get updated?
[20:12] <vsayikiran> murkyMurk: i am ready to do, i want it should work for me
[20:13] <Fryguy--> Gosha: performance increases, more driver support, features added on, support for other architectures
[20:13] <frank23> Gosha: drivers get updated all the time.
[20:13] <TheRepacker> Ghone[fark] special case here also, 100.14.19 causes lockup reverted to 9639 now rock solid
[20:13] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: good. Start by opening a terminal and running sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[20:14] <Ghone[fark]> TheRepacker Your quotind of version numbers leads me to believe you know a lot more about the nVidia cards and making them work than I do.
[20:14] <Gosha> Fryguy--: So, if I find Gutsy slower and my system worked perfectly with an erlier version of ubuntu there is no need to upgrade? I mean, all those new stuff like the indexing and fast-user-switching just slows my computer down.

[20:15] <tomd123> Does anyone know how to enable the S1 and S2 keys on a vaio laptop
[20:15] <Fryguy--> Gosha: if you don't want to upgrade, then don't.  I'd argue there's plenty of reasons to upgrade, and all of those things that you claim slow your machine down can be turned off pretty easily
[20:15] <Box|UK> John117,  i could talk you through it but i does involve a restart
[20:15] <jotil> stinger05: you should
[20:15] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: when it's open, scroll down to Section "Device"
[20:15] <Gosha> Fryguy--: I have tried to shut as many as I found down. But it is still running slower in this new version.

[20:16] <jotil> paritosh: change your grub root from the grub command prompt
[20:16] <Fryguy--> Gosha: so then roll back to a previous version.  Or consider taking the time to really learn linux and put together a customized desktop that works just the way you want
[20:16] <j1tters> Does anyone know if ubuntu will run on a dual proc alpha server?
[20:17] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: BIOS only matters pre-boot really, an upgraded BIOS should not make your PC go slow

[20:21] <Fethman> is there any keyboard to send a forground program to the background
[20:21] <astro76> pubuntu, yes use a partition tool like we said to shrink your windows partition to the desired size, then just install Ubuntu into the remaining free space
[20:21] <m1r> john117 ,rest of space :)

[20:22] <Fethman> and If I close the connection it will stop
=== saucisson__ is now known as saucisson
[20:22] <sco50000> trident523: it worked fine in feisty
[20:22] <astro76> Fethman, ctrl+z to suspend, then bg %job number to background it, jobs to list jobs
[20:22] <beni> !screen | Fethman
[20:22] <ubotu> Fethman: screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[20:23] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: when that is done save the file and reboot
[20:23] <k5ehx> trident523: don't know. The problem isn't that 3d doesn't work, it's that the spinning desktop thing isn't configured.
[20:23] <John117> m1r okay, thanks.  What is a good program to allow ntfs read/right no ubuntu?
[20:23] <trident523> sco50000: ati is a known bug currently, see the known bugs page. (I had a fightwith it this moring.)
[20:23] <John117> m1r write that is.
[20:23] <astro76> Fethman, yeah then you need screen
[20:23] <trident523> k5ehx: run glxgears from the terminal.
[20:23] <murkyMurk> vsayikiran: you could just restart X but I figure that'll take for ever
[20:23] <sco50000> trident523: OK
[20:23] <Fethman> thank you
[20:23] <beni> !ntfs | John117
[20:23] <ubotu> John117: ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[20:23] <Fethman> I'll try it
[20:23] <Fryguy--> John117: you get it included with 7.10, with 7.04 and before you need to install ntfs3g
[20:23] <k5ehx> trident523: works fine
[20:23] <TheRepacker> I have to thank Bill Gates for Vista, made me try Ubuntu
[20:24] <m1r> john117, i wouldnt recomend that
[20:24] <sco50000> trident523: where can i go look at this bug?
[20:24] <kondor101> fryguy ty working ;)
[20:24] <Jban> Fryguy--: Ahh, ok I understand now... I know that was a silly question, but I've only had Ubuntu for 2 days now  so... some really apparent things aren't common to me :)
[20:24] <trident523> k5ehx: you could be missing the package, or removed it from the menu. Sorry, I don't use 3D effects. :/ hopefully someone can help you.
[20:24] <John117> fryguy-- okay thanks.  no need to do anything, huh?
[20:24] <beni> TheRepacker: welcome to the Freedom Movement buddy! :)
[20:24] <John117> m1r wouldn't recommend what?
[20:24] <Fryguy--> John117: on 7.10 it should just work
[20:24] <trident523> sco50000: hold on a second, let me go find it again. :P
[20:24] <pubuntu> i haven't yet installed ubuntu.... i'd like to make it 85% windows 15% ubuntu
[20:24] <m1r> john117, write from XP to ubuntu
[20:24] <wirechief1> trident523 i had issues with ATI too but found that a way to install 8.41.7 and now works fine
[20:24] <beni> pubuntu: how come?
[20:24] <k5ehx> yeah, trident523. I just need to figure out what package it is, I think. THanks for your help, I'll do more googling
[20:24] <Fryguy--> it's one of the big newbie-enhancements of 7.10
[20:24] <BHSPitLappy> pubuntu, that's a terrible ratio
[20:24] <sco50000> pubuntu: that's exactly what i did
[20:24] <pubuntu> why terrible?
[20:24] <John117> m1r well... all of my external drives are in NTFS
[20:24] <pubuntu> what heppened when you did it?
[20:25] <FotoPhocus> I'm installing Ubuntu tomorrow night when I get my new PC built.  I've got a 400gb hard drive and 200gb hard drive.  400 will go to XP, pics, music, etc.  The other drive will go to Ubuntu
[20:25] <beni> pubuntu: because the majority of the code would be buggy as hell
[20:25] <Jban> Fryguy--: What was the non-newbie way... ?
[20:25] <sco50000> pubuntu:it worked fine
[20:25] <John117> m1r no, i won't access the ubuntu partition from windows.. is that what you mean?
=== TheDreamer is now known as Youri
[20:25] <beni> pubuntu: Just boot windows.. *rr*
[20:25] <BHSPitLappy> pubuntu, I was still a primary windows user.
[20:25] <Fryguy--> FotoPhocus: sounds like you are wasting a lot of space
[20:25] <trident523> wirechief1: I ended up having to fix mine by fixing a display error.
[20:25] <m1r> john117 , yes ok
[20:25] <FotoPhocus> Could be, but I don't have anything else to do with it
[20:25] <John117> m1r okay.. What is the name of the file system that Linux uses?
[20:25] <wirechief1> trident523: i used the script from kanotix
[20:26] <FotoPhocus> I had a 200gb first, and the 400gb I got on special for $100
[20:26] <BHSPitLappy> FotoPhocus, give me the 200GB, and partition the 400GB
[20:26] <pubuntu> what should be the proper ratio on my 160gb HD if i'm a primary windows user?
[20:26] <m1r> john117, u have many, ubuntu uses ext3
[20:26] <trident523> sco50000: People with ATI display adapters may get a blank screen when loading X due to the driver being unable to initialize certain hardware. Upstream is working on it, and hopefully we'll be able to release an update for 7.10 soon after the release. In the meantime, add 'Option "LVDSBiosNativeMode" "false"' to the driver section of xorg.conf. Bug #132716
[20:26] <Fryguy--> FotoPhocus: you should make a like 50gb windows partition, 15gb ubuntu/swap, and make the rest be separate data partitions so it's easier to work with
[20:26] <omegaweopon> A while ago I stumbled onto a VMware virtual machine creator.  Upon running it though It would appear I forgot to add a cdrom drvie to it.  Does anyone know what I found?  Almighty google is failing me
[20:26] <sco50000> John117: it uses ext3 and ext2 on older kernels
[20:26] <beni> John117: ext3 mainly

[20:26] <beni> omegaweopon: dont run vmware
[20:26] <omegaweopon> Beni: Oh?
[20:26] <John117> OKay.. When i install ubuntu as a dual boot, and do manual partition sizes, does it make 3 partitions or two?
[20:26] <beni> yesterday i wrote a Howto explaining how to run windows on ubuntu
[20:26] <wirechief1> trident523: it worked great no problems, not like i had when i used Ubuntu's
[20:26] <TaBo> how i can open server in other window?
[20:26] <pubuntu>  what should be the proper ratio on my 160gb HD if i'm a primary windows user?
[20:26] <FotoPhocus> I'm not really familiar enough with Ubuntu or Linux to do anything other than the guided partitioning
[20:26] <BHSPitLappy> omegaweopon, I prefer VirtualBox, personally

[20:27] <trident523> wirechief1: I don't use 3D anything, so, I'm good. :P
[20:27] <riotkittie> Badpenguin86: if you open /boot/grub/menu.lst  there's an example towards the top that might be helpful
[20:27] <astro76> omegaweopon, easyvmx.com ? I'm not sure what your question is
[20:27] <Suchthefool> can anyone help me get my wireless internet working again? having problems with gusty!
[20:27] <beni> BHSPitLappy: my tutorial uses Virtualbox
[20:27] <Fryguy--> pubuntu: ubuntu needs at most 15GB including swap, windows needs whatever it needs depending on what you are using it for, and then make the rest be a separate data partition
[20:27] <beni> And it just works..
[20:27] <sco50000> trident523: can you give me a link to the bug's page?
=== Xjs_ is now known as Xjs
[20:27] <murkyMurk> John117: it makes one partition in auto mode...sticks it all in / whcih is good enough for most people most of the time
[20:27] <BHSPitLappy> beni, virtualbox needs no tutorial, it's dead simple
[20:27] <omegaweopon> Wow simple
[20:27] <function1> does networkmanager support phase2 auth now?
[20:27] <[[Charlie]]> I need some help here. When I hit the quit button, neither Shut down nor restart are choices. Only stand by and hibernate.
[20:27] <beni> BHSPitLappy: yes

[20:28] <beni> Lejzi: wmaster0 means that you radaptor needs drivers.
[20:28] <murkyMurk> John117: ahhh..forgot about swap partiotin..there's that as well
[20:28] <sco50000> trident523: thanks
[20:28] <beni> omegaweopon: have phun!
[20:28] <Matic`Makovec> Is there any special place where Gutsy stores "print screens"? Is the management of that screenies any different then before?
[20:28] <Lejzi> beni so i can simply use ndwrapper and thats it ?? no more problems? :)
[20:28] <John117> mukymurky okay.. so about 60gb for a man part and then 2-4 for a swap is cool?
[20:28] <BHSPitLappy> Matic`Makovec, when you hit the button, it asks you where you want to save it.
[20:28] <[[Charlie]]> I need some help here. When I hit the quit button, neither Shut down nor restart are choices. Only stand by and hibernate. please help
[20:28] <murkyMurk> Lejzi: just use wlan0 as normal,,i think wmaster is for ipv6
[20:29] <omegaweopon> HEy beni
[20:29] <beni> Lejzi: Yep ndiswrapper should be the solution
[20:29] <Matic`Makovec> So it isn't any different. I wonder why it didn't do that just now. Thank you BHSPitLappy
[20:29] <beni> !ndiswrapper | Lejzi
[20:29] <ubotu> Lejzi: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[20:29] <k5ehx> trident523: it was "compizconfig-settings-manager", btw
[20:29] <Lejzi> ty
[20:29] <Fryguy--> Matic`Makovec: hitting print screen (for me at least) pops up a dialog asking where to save the image to
[20:29] <Suchthefool> i use ndiswrapper on gusty and it works perfectly
[20:29] <wirechief1> trident523: when i used Ubuntu's script it screwed up my xorg.conf bigtime
[20:29] <Suchthefool> but it doesnt seem to work
[20:29] <Suchthefool> with 7.10
[20:29] <Jban> Fryguy--: Ok, so I tried opening a Word2003 document that's normally on my Windows' desktop while in Ubuntu now... but it opens up with my name visible in the document, and the rest are a bunch of random ##########'s and triangle-question marks.  Do I need to install a new pluggin or something?
[20:29] <murkyMurk> John117: yep if a little heavy on swap...generally same swap as you have RAM up to about 1G
[20:29] <linux1> hiya ppl im using " make CC=/usr/bin/gcc -j3 " to compile so i use both core in my cpu how do i set that permanently
[20:29] <Suchthefool> properly i mean
[20:29] <beni> omegaweopon: hum.. Are you gutsy?
[20:29] <Matic`Makovec> Fryguy--, yesh
[20:29] <omegaweopon> Yeah
[20:29] <Judgegeo> I setup a dual boot last night, between Vista and Ubuntu 7.10. I changed the boot file wrong so neither system would boot. I did a system recover and changed the boot file in Vista again. But when i select to boot into Ubuntu i get an error asking me to insert sysdisk
[20:29] <omegaweopon> Nno
[20:29] <BHSPitLappy> Suchthefool, so it works with 7.10, but not with 7.10, eh
[20:29] <BHSPitLappy> sounds tricky
[20:29] <astro76> Jban, opened it with what? openoffice?
[20:29] <Fryguy--> Jban: probably.  I don't use openoffice much so I can't answer that specific question

[20:30] <beni> [[Charlie]]: you are kidding me, aren't ya?!

[20:34] <omegaweopon> Im fiesty for those who think Im gutsy
[20:34] <MasterShrek> Judgegeo, you need to load ubuntu from grub
[20:34] <fairway> MasterShrek: by package management system?
[20:34] <BHSPitLappy> garu, dvd comes with more software on it.
[20:34] <Badpenguin86> Is there a way to just reinstall grub so it picks up all os'es without messing with the config?
[20:34] <isaacj87> i was hoping to get some help?
[20:34] <MasterShrek> fairway, yes, sudo apt-get install irssi
[20:34] <Doofus_Magoo> Can anyone recommend a good resource for troubleshooting connectivity issues with ndiswrapper after a new 7.10 upgrade?
[20:34] <trident523> sco50000: Oh, drats, I thought you were that other person. >.>
[20:34] <LiMaO> omegaweopon: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads --> download virtualbox here. no matter what your version is, there is a .deb for it.

[20:34] <BHSPitLappy> garu, software you can easily install over the internet otherwise
[20:34] <crdlb> Dyus, #hardware
[20:34] <Judgegeo> MasterShrek: How can i do that?
[20:34] <isaacj87> MasterShrek: My system sounds don't work correctly. They were working fine in Feisty
=== mat__ is now known as matmax
[20:35] <Jban> Dan2552: Ah, ok, so I could just grab that from Add Progs by typing in "Crossover" ?
[20:35] <sco50000> trident523: i was just using whatever drivers come with ubuntu
[20:35] <isaacj87> MasterShrek: my guess is it has something to do with ESD
[20:35] <sco50000> trident523: i have a ATI Radeon 9550
[20:35] <Ind[y]> Sorry, is your "System"-->"About Ubuntu" there (Gutsy)?

[20:35] <flick> if i want to pursue development in gnome, any ide in particular (for c++, python, or any other language that may be the norm) you suggest?
[20:35] <trident523> sco50000: Okay, so you either use flgrx,ati, or vesa.
[20:35] <Dan2552> Jban: no, it's proprietry, you have to pay .. in theory
[20:35] <Fryguy--> flick: use vim
[20:35] <isaacj87> MasterShrek: my sound works....but I'm using custom sounds for my system sounds and they don't play
[20:35] <beni> Jban: Crossover is a Program to run Microsoft Office in Linux. Don't you Like Open Office?
[20:35] <flick> (please don't say vi)
[20:35] <garu> flick I use Netbeans
[20:35] <Jake1> Is there a way in linux to navigate to some directory with nautilus and then switch to a terminal in that specific directory?
[20:35] <murkyMurk> vi
[20:36] <MasterShrek> isaacj87, im not really good with sound issues, but u should pastebin the output, if any, of: lsmod | grep snd
[20:36] <Fryguy--> flick: fine i won't say vim, even though i already did.  emacs
[20:36] <sco50000> trident523: so what should i do?
[20:36] <jnc> flick: I've had good experience with Ruby and RubyGtk bindings, with glade to build the UI
[20:36] <Seveas> Jake1, apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
[20:36] <Dan2552> beni: open office gets formatting extremely wrong in my experience
[20:36] <MasterShrek> oh nvm then isaacj87 dont pastebin that
[20:36] <trident523> sco50000: Do you have a backup of your xorg.conf?
[20:36] <kishan_> jake u need to install a scripts in nautilus
[20:36] <omegaweopon> There is a resource I need to add! Bleh I kept asking.  Bleh
[20:36] <Dyus> crdlb: ty
[20:36] <astro76> Jban, maybe from Word try saving as an older version doc format
[20:36] <BHSPitLappy> flick, Eclipse is somewhat popular (for an IDE, at least), though it is fat and java-based
[20:36] <murkyMurk> Jake1: just navigate in the terminal, it's easy
[20:36] <jnc> flick: many developers swear by Python and PyGtk bindings, I can't stand the Python language though
[20:36] <linux1> ok no when i set export CC=/usr/bin/gcc -j3   i get this message bash: export: `-j3': not a valid identifier
[20:36] <isaacj87> MasterShrek: haha okay
[20:36] <sco50000> trident523: i don't even know what that is
[20:36] <Jban> beni: Like I was saying before beni, I just tried now to open an Word2003 document from my Window's partition using OpenOffice on Ubuntu7.10, and non of the info came up correctly.
[20:36] <flick> Fryguy--, sorry... i will try vim - only i find it complicated to learn
[20:36] <Judgegeo> MasterShrek: I used easyBCD to add the linux boot, so i dont understand why it wont work?
[20:36] <teeheehee> what is the best resource for learning how to use IRC clients on ubuntu? anyone?
[20:36] <Seveas> linux1, export CC="/usr/bin/gcc -j3"

[20:36] <travkin> RUSSKIJ DRUMANDBASS SDELANO V ROSSII!
[20:36] <Fryguy--> flick: sure.  After you get over the initial learning curve though you are going to wonder why you didn't learn it a long time ago
[20:36] <flick> jnc, PyGtk is an ide?
[20:37] <MasterShrek> isaacj87, what u choose your custom sounds does it allow you to change the sound device or driver or something
[20:37] <sco50000> trident523: why?
[20:37] <fairway> i use wine with real office
[20:37] <jawee_> where is the lock file for apt-get?
[20:37] <MasterShrek> Judgegeo, i dont know, never used easyBCD
[20:37] <beni> Dan2552: Ok this will end in a war, but imho its the other way round. Most new MOffice 200X are NOT compatible with older versions! OO can save to PDF and any other free format thats much enough.
[20:37] <trident523> teeheehee: learning? The man pages? The help file?
[20:37] <garu> BHSPitLappy so, in terms of stability, there is no difference whatsoever?

[20:38] <beni> Dan2552: If you present this reason for using MS Office that "Microsoft-only Presentations Stuff" which are closed-source etc is not supported by OO then we may staywith InternetExplorer because we miss ActiveX controls!
[20:38] <hexno> !compiz-fusion
[20:38] <Fryguy--> flick: you can do whatever you want in vim.  as for specific resources, i'd suggest reading the books/faqs on vim.org to start

[20:39] <BHSPitLappy> garu, it runs slow on my systems, but I have old hardware
[20:39] <Pici> kkathman: The only thing needed is ccsm to config it.
[20:39] <sco50000> trident523: i can get files off my ubuntu partition from here in windows, so i can get that file you were talking about
[20:39] <hexno> Hey Pici, how do I set it up so I can config compiz-fusion?

[20:40] <TheMafia> beni, and then it will simply be in an "up" state?
[20:40] <joerack> Could somebody assist me in installing Vmware? i really can't do it... been trying hours
[20:40]  * murkyMurk is going for a kebab
[20:40] <trident523> teeheehee: Which IRC client are you using?
[20:40] <patricknev> hi, is there a dock for ubuntu that works without compiz/xgl
[20:40] <Judgegeo> MasterShrek: Thanks
[20:40] <BHSPitLappy> garu, well, actually, I -upgraded- a feisty system, and it's... problematic.  I did fresh installs on two other systems, and it's smooth sailing.
[20:40] <Jake1> seveas how do i use nautilus-open-terminal ? i see no difference
[20:40] <kevin_121> anyone know where else i can download themes other than gnome-looks? it appears to be down right now
[20:40] <trident523> joerack: Don't use vmware, install it really. It's much more cooler.
[20:40] <Jake1> how do i use it?
[20:40] <MasterShrek> joerack, i would use virtualbox if i were you
[20:41] <Seveas> Jake1, rightclick on a folder in nautilus and select 'open terminal here'
[20:41] <beni> TheMafia: euhm if you remove the "auto" eth1 will just be deactivated because it has no ip config stuff etc
[20:41] <MasterShrek> vmware is quite bloated
[20:41] <Jban> *raises hand* Well, that's nice you have your opinions but lol, I'm just looking for a quick pluggin fix or a recommendation for a Linux "Office" replacement, because I despise Windows.  So... new package for OO or is there something that would allow me to finish up my degree without having to change to Windows?
[20:41] <joerack> virtualbox? is it good?
[20:41] <flick> how can i remove all kde applications?
[20:41] <beni> joerack: try virtualbox its a lot easier!
[20:41] <TheMafia> beni, this is an interface I am using with snort and port mirroring, I want it active, but with no ip, etc.
[20:41] <Jake1> seveas after i have installed it do i have to restart x-windows?
[20:41] <beni> joerack: made a tutorial on this one http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/how_to_run_windows_applications_easily_under_ubuntu_linux_yes/

[20:41] <Mehlron> Hey, I installed 7.10 on Friday and have been having connectivity problems since. I connect to DSL through linkysys WRT54G router -- I can ping the router and local computers, I can ping various addresses (ie www.google.com, www.msn.com, etc). Traceroutes go for a while and eventually get no reply.  And applications like firefox, pidgin, and synaptic's downloader can't access anything  -- any ideas?
[20:41] <trident523> Jban: There's some website for downconverting .docx and the new offices files to regular ones.
[20:41] <joerack> Ok thanks
[20:42] <astro76> Jban, openoffice is probably the best at MS formats... you do realize that even old version of Word will not be able to read your file?
[20:42] <trident523> !wireless | Mehlron
[20:42] <ubotu> Mehlron: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs

[20:42] <Tarkus> anyone use "emesene" as IM client? im wondering why its not in the ubuntu repos.. in other distros it is..
[20:43] <TheMafia> beni, you can do a tcpdump on an interface that has no ip bound to it?  That is how I want eth1 to be
[20:43] <garu> BHSPitLappy I didnt ask anything about upgrading...but anywayz...I had the release candidate before, and then upgraded to the final release.Big Problems
[20:43] <garu> lol
[20:43] <patricknev> hi, is there a dock for ubuntu that works without compiz/xgl
[20:43] <trident523> Mehlron: Make sure that you have your network settings set for a wired connection, not a wireless one?
[20:43] <beni> Tarkus: We got Pidgin etc
[20:43] <Burlynn> im loving the darklooks theme
[20:43] <trident523> patricknev: Probably, but why don't you want 3D?
[20:43] <Fryguy--> Tarkus: if it's not in the repositories, and you want to use it, just compile it yourself

[20:44] <Pete1234> there's some guys that have ported an RPM of my printer's driver to work in ubuntu but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work in Gusty
[20:44] <Mehlron> It is, there's no wireless functionality on this box, and ubuntu is correctly not showing it in the network settings...
[20:44] <patricknev> trident523:i have a laptop with integrated video card, so no 3d :(
[20:44] <beni> TheMafia: but if your interfaces has no IP address, it will be not active -> deactivated?! Anyway, only if there's a HUB used for routing (or not routing..) you will be able to listen to the network
[20:44] <Judgegeo> MasterShrek: I did exactly as https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows says. And thats where im stuck
[20:44] <astro76> Jban, I realize that, I'm saying you should save them as and older format from windows
[20:44] <trident523> patricknev: I bet there is one, but I don't know if it.
[20:44] <garu> BHSPitLappy but now, i got a clean install, they work fine,but, in one of the computer, the only problem I have, is that it keeps asking me if I want to keep X setting for the keyboard, or the Gnome ones
[20:44] <percival> (Brand newbie here)...I decided I wanted to get into linux, so I got Ubuntu to load on my gateway using live CD, and since everything seemed fine, I want to intall it as a second OS, I click on install and it wants to partition my harddrive, will this destroy my windows?
[20:44] <Dan2552> astro76: older formats lack in certain features though..
[20:44] <kale> need some help for a issue on an ubuntu system
[20:44] <patricknev> i use awn on my  desktop though trident523, but that doesnt work, akamaru or engage dont work either

[20:45] <MasterShrek> Judgegeo, you booted the livecd and ran the grub-install command

[20:45] <beni> percival: probably
[20:45] <astro76> Dan2552, big difference between wordxp and word2003?
[20:45] <Fryguy--> percival: not if you follow the guided install
[20:45] <Judgegeo> MasterShrek: No, ill try
[20:45] <TheMafia> I want eth1 to come up but without any ip or dhcp, what do I need to enter in the interfaces file?
[20:45] <Seveas> percival, you'll want the "guided partitioning, resize first disk and use free space" option
[20:45] <Fryguy--> percival: if you read the messages, you'll note that it's resizing your windows partition to make room for ubuntu
[20:45] <beni> percival: try to grab an advanced user which supports you during the migration process!

[20:46] <astro76> Dan2552, sometimes compromises must be made :P
[20:46] <TheMafia> I could just add ifconfig eth1 up to rc.local, but I would rather put the correct syntax in the interfaces file

[20:46] <Mr_Giraffe> Jban, look at how dos progressed to windows xp
[20:46] <astro76> Jban, it's an issue for organizations or people with lots of legacy documents that can't be converted, sure

[20:46] <astro76> Jban, but I would imagine linux converts would want to use free open source office software
[20:46] <Altk> is there anyway to re-run an initial setup script for 7.10 GG?
[20:47] <garu> BHSPitLappy the other one, it wont even save my key for the wireless networks (gotta type it everytime I start the machine). also, when I'm connected wirelessly, and I start a download, I lose my connection until I restart again
[20:47] <garu> lol
[20:47] <Dan2552> fairway: it adds the columns in header/footer for example
[20:47] <Pete1234> how long has gusty been released?
[20:47] <trident523> Altk: Why? What do you need to change?
[20:47] <kkathman> flick system-preferences- appearance I believe
[20:47] <Fryguy--> Altk: dpkg-reconfigure
[20:47] <astro76> Jban, and openoffice is available for windows
[20:47] <MasterShrek> Pete1234, like 4 days
[20:47] <fairway> Dan2552: is it an extended doc file?
[20:47] <Altk> i get a spinning cursor instead of alogin screen.
[20:47] <Dan2552> fairway: it's the new office 2007 format, with all they're new stuff
[20:47] <rupertg> Gutsy won't set the maximum resolution (1650x1050) for my Samsung X60. The configuration utility has a maximum res of 1200x800.
[20:47] <Pete1234> MasterShrek: that'll explain why i'm having problems with my printer driver that everyone says works fine in fiesty the :
[20:47] <Pete1234> then
[20:47] <fairway> Dan2552: I see
[20:47] <flick> kkathman, thanks... i think i found it, i wanted to actually decrease the resolution (DPI) it seems
[20:48] <Jban> astro76: I see, but if I were to turn in a paper or something to a professor, I would have to still work in Office right?  As in, turning it in via a digital dropbox or whatnot.
[20:48] <trident523> rupertg: set your minintor in the new display confuguration window.
[20:48] <Box|UK> i like Deluge not too dissimilar to utorrent
[20:48] <crossout> one question, the linux partition on my hardrive, GRUB on the other hand still tries to load at boot (giving me error 22). Any idea on how to stop this so it would boot normally? Thanks in advance.
[20:48] <MasterShrek> Jban, just use an rtf
[20:48] <astro76> Jban, there's pdf.. but I'm afraid we're straying offtopic
[20:48] <rupertg> trident - it's on the internal LCD panel
[20:48] <Fryguy--> crossout: what specifically do you want to do?
[20:48] <rupertg> which the display configurator doesn't seem to recognise
[20:48] <Dan2552> purhaps we should make an #ubuntuoffice
[20:49] <Jban> astro76: I can view the documents that I have that are in PDF format.
[20:49] <kale> after an upgrade hda, changed to sda, fstab were updated, but not for hdb, which changed to sdb. Why is this?
[20:49] <BHSPitLappy> garu, that's weird.  Both of my clean installs were RC's.
[20:49] <astro76> Jban, ... Openoffice saves to pdf
[20:49] <trident523> rupertg: Yes, but if you set the monitor to your minitor, it usually unlocks the size options you need.
[20:49] <astro76> Jban, for your professor :p
[20:49] <rupertg> my monitor isn't on the list
[20:49] <Pingviller> anyone know why my $ mount -o file /media/cdrom stopped working since my last reboot? getting "mount: special device /dev/scd0 does not exist"
[20:49] <crossout> oops let me rephrase, I deleted linux partition, grub still tries to load how can I fix this?
[20:49] <Burlynn> just bought a new dvd burner, ubuntu accepted it fine, awesome, but how do i verify if dma is turned on or not?
[20:49] <Pingviller> with SU
[20:49] <Dan2552> astro76: my teachers complained when i zipped a word doc, think how confused they'd be if it were PDF
[20:49] <Stormx2> !dma | Burlynn
[20:49] <ubotu> Burlynn: dma is Direct Memory Access/Addressing. It makes hard disks & optical drives transfer data faster, and is almost always enabled in Ubuntu 6.06. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DMA
[20:49] <MasterShrek> crossout, what os are you trying to boot now?
[20:50] <MrKeuner> hi, how can I increase my agpaperture size? Do I have to edit the /etc/Xorg.conf manually or is there a more appropriate way?
[20:50] <MasterShrek> crossout, windows?
[20:50] <Burlynn> ty
[20:50] <garu> BHSPitLappy I still think that they should'v worked a little bit more on it.Its too buggy
[20:50] <crossout> windows. yup
[20:50] <pubuntu> what is the difference between Primary, Logical and Extended partition? :-S
[20:50] <Stormx2> crossout: Take this to ##windows
[20:50] <lillpelle> Hi. i upgraded from feisty to gutsy, and my previous locale (typically LANG=en_GB.UTF-8) was changed to LANG=en_US.UTF-8. Moreover I cant find the localeconf package in the repository. Any ideas?
[20:50] <Pete1234> i'd like to install a package but it wants libglib1.2 - how do i make a link to fool it into thinking i have that library?
[20:50] <Jban> astro76: Haha, yeah, that's good for him but you know how [censored refence to a certain part of the butt] professors are... Word format only! Cause they are computer deficient.
[20:50] <crossout> oh k thanks :)
[20:50] <Seveas> Pete1234, you don't
[20:50] <trident523> !offtopic | Jban
[20:50] <ubotu> Jban: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[20:50] <end0r57> is there one media player that's recommended to play almost anything pretty well?
[20:50] <BHSPitLappy> Dan2552, PDF is extremely common and widely used, even among teachers.
[20:50] <MasterShrek> crossout, pop your windows cd in, when it loads hit r for recovery console, follow the prompts and when u get a command line run: fixmbr
[20:50] <Fryguy--> pubuntu: the x86 architecture allows 4 primary partitions, and as many extended partitions as you want.  With any sort of reasonably modern computer this doesn't mean anything
[20:50] <astro76> Jban, it saves as word format too
[20:51] <BHSPitLappy> garu, like I said, no problems here.
[20:51] <pubuntu> okay, thanks friend
[20:51] <Pete1234> Seveas: i obviously have libglib but a newer version. how do i install this package then?
[20:51] <Jban> astro76: I see, so it is just a problem from the Word side.
[20:51] <Fryguy--> end0r57: vlc will play everything except realvideo
[20:51] <Dan2552> BHSPitLappy: you'd think ZIP would be too though, especially with Windows XP - it has a built in client
[20:51] <trident523> end0r57: vlc has been known to play nearly everything.
[20:51] <crossout> nice MasterShrek thanks for the tip
[20:51] <astro76> Jban, indeed
[20:51] <MasterShrek> yep
[20:51] <end0r57> how can i get VLC to work in mozilla tho?
[20:51] <Seveas> Pete1234, glib2 is completely different from glib1.2. You'll need it
[20:51] <BHSPitLappy> Dan2552, not really.  Normal people don't understand compression.
[20:51] <CheesyMonkey> end0r57, mozilla-vlc
[20:51] <Jban> astro76: I understand it better now, thanks.  I was just trying to understand all the concepts so I know how to work around the problem.
[20:51] <Altk> So any ideas about my spinning cursor on boot? I was upgrading from FF to GG, and it seemed to go fine until the reboot at the end.
[20:51] <Pete1234> how do i install glib1.2 in ubuntu then? it's not in the repository...
=== theman is now known as blahabalah
[20:52] <Dan2552> BHSPitLappy: you'd think an IT practitioners course teacher would
[20:52] <Seveas> Pete1234, it is
[20:52] <garu> BHSPitLappy that's good. but, considering the amount of people that had problems... :o
[20:52] <astro76> Jban, no problem
[20:52] <Seveas> !find libglib1.2
[20:52] <ubotu> Found: libglib1.2, libglib1.2-dbg, libglib1.2-dev
[20:52] <BHSPitLappy> Dan2552, no you wouldn't
[20:52] <Seveas> !info libglib1.2
[20:52] <ubotu> libglib1.2: The GLib library of C routines. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.2.10-17build1 (gutsy), package size 119 kB, installed size 280 kB
[20:52] <Fethman> damn quake wars plays great on gutsy :)
[20:52] <blahabalah> Anyone know about grub?
[20:52] <Vista|G33Z3R> HAHAHAH running mirc :P~ in ubuntu
[20:52] <Dan2552> BHSPitLappy: but compression was even one of our assignments, which they had to mark...
[20:52] <Pete1234> oh yeah
[20:52] <Fryguy--> blahabalah: ask the question you really want to ask
[20:52] <omegaweopon> Ok I have virtualbox installed, how do I get to it?  I had to download the .deb and I cant find it
[20:52] <Fryguy--> Vista|G33Z3R: :( use irssi :(
[20:52] <rupertg> does anyone know how to make the system/administration/screen and graphics preferences recognise the LCD in my laptop?
[20:52] <end0r57> CheesyMonkey: can that be done with apt-get? it says the package could not be found.
[20:52] <garu> BHSPitLappy one thing that shoulnt happen.Everyone that had ubuntu perfectly working on their computer, should still have no problem.lol
[20:52] <MasterShrek> Altk, try hitting ctrl+alt+f1, logging in and then: sudo apt-get update   then: sudo apt-get upgrade    then rebooting
[20:52] <CheesyMonkey> end0r57, One sec ill grab you the exact name
[20:53] <Vista|G33Z3R> fryguy i like mirc its  neat
[20:53] <blahabalah> I installed ubuntu on another computer and the first restart it went fine.. grub worked and everything
[20:53] <rupertg> xresprobe doesn't return anything sensible, as far as i can tell
[20:53] <Pete1234> Seveas: it's not in my list :-S
[20:53] <Fryguy--> Vista|G33Z3R: have you used other, better irc clients?
[20:53] <Seveas> Pete1234, enable universe
[20:53] <blahabalah> then i shut it down and started it .. "operating system not found"
[20:53] <Jban> astro76: If I asked you a question about porting a windows Pizza into Ubuntu, would that be office topic? Hehe, just joking, I was up here early in the morning and wasn't used to topic rules :), so I apologize.
[20:53] <Altk> MasterShrek: Thanks, will do

[20:53] <Antiphonal> I'm running into a problem on the LiveCD. It boots up but then X-windows restarts several times, then throws an error, then restarts over and over again. I have a feeling I'm making a dumb mistake somewhere. Radeon X1650, btw. Any tips? I'd love to try this Gutsy thing out. I looked on the forums, but no luck. :-(
[20:53] <end0r57> CheesyMonkey: thanks, i appreciate it.
[20:53] <Vista|G33Z3R> Fryguy-- tried xchat but i think its a bit gh3y
[20:53] <Fryguy--> Vista|G33Z3R: it is
[20:53] <Fryguy--> Vista|G33Z3R: so use irssi
[20:53] <Pete1234> Seveas: many thanks i'll tak ea look
[20:53] <astro76> Jban, I think questions related to using openoffice in ubuntu are on topic
[20:53] <Seveas> Vista|G33Z3R, keep the foul language out of here
[20:53] <blahabalah> i can boot up when i put the alternate CD in and go to boot from first hard disk.. but i dont wanna have to keep doing that
[20:54] <CheesyMonkey> end0r57, mozilla-plugin-vlc
[20:54] <blahabalah> know a solution?
[20:54] <Vista|G33Z3R> Seveas you no what gh3y means?
[20:54] <juano> hello all, im having a dns issue, i have a router belkin, 2 pcs connected directly to the router, under windows in both pcs, everything seems fine, name resolving, dhcp, etc... , on one pc when i boot into linux, if i check the configuration of my router, at dhcp client list, it sais hostname unknown instead of the local machine name, and if i check under windows it resolves fine to the local name
[20:54] <juano> the problem is that after i get ip , etc. from dhcp server, when i start navigating through mozilla browser it gets stuck like 5 to 10 seconds searching names
[20:54] <Altk> How do I get my wireless to connect from the console?
[20:54] <MartinW> How do I delete a podcast from rythmbox?
[20:54] <Burlynn> i have a laptop ssh'd into my desktop, trying to stream video, totem claims it cannot play it. can you not stream media via ssh? (running through nautilus)
[20:54] <Vista|G33Z3R> ill google  irssi
[20:54] <Dan2552> CheesyMonkey: would mozilla-plugin-vlc even work with divx/stage6?
[20:54] <rupertg> ok, if nobody knows about internal LCD resolution hassles on Gutsy - where's the best forum to ask?
[20:54] <MenZa> !ubuntuforums | rupertg
[20:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ubuntuforums - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[20:54] <beni> juano: thats everywhere. Linux has no "hostsnames" in the Windows Way
[20:55] <MenZa> !forums | rupertg
[20:55] <ubotu> rupertg: The Ubuntu forums can be found at http://www.ubuntuforums.org. There is also a channel on IRC Freenode #ubuntuforums.
[20:55] <MenZa> hmm
[20:55] <MasterShrek> Altk, iwconfig and iwlist, check the man pages for those commands
[20:55] <omegaweopon> If I downloaded the .deb for virtualbox and ran it, how would I access it?  I tried running it but nothing came up, and it didnt install into my applications menu
[20:55] <PriceChild> !ubuntuforums is <alias> forums
[20:55] <astro76> Dan2552, with stage6 you have to save the file instead of streaming
[20:55] <ubotu> I'll remember that, PriceChild
[20:55] <CheesyMonkey> Dan2552, It should work with anything that VLC can play
[20:55] <blahabalah> anyone know how to fix the start up problem??
[20:55] <PriceChild> MenZa, ^
[20:55] <nahoo> hola
[20:55] <Fryguy--> rupertg: I dunno, my resolution was set correctly to 2560x1600 without any problems.  I'd suggest just editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually if you are having problems
[20:55] <astro76> Dan2552, or maybe it will work with the vlc plugin, not sure
[20:55] <juano> beni so this does not have to do with my browsing latency ?
[20:55] <DanaG> dang, I wish there were an unofficial-plugins repo for compiz-fusion.
[20:55] <DanaG> For Gutsy, I mean.
[20:55] <Dan2552> i use opera browser anyway though...
[20:56] <blahabalah> Fryguy: u know of a solution
[20:56] <astro76> Dan2552, yeah you can just save the file
[20:56] <Fryguy--> blahabalah: install grub correctly..
[20:56] <endo> I'm having so much trouble with Gutsy, what is the reason for banshee not recognizing my ipod anymore?
[20:56] <blahabalah> Fryguy: reinstall it?
[20:56] <beni> juano: Nope. Why should you browser search for hostnames?
[20:56] <endo> and, why cannot I not open AWN or compiz-settings-manager, they just are inactive after I click them

[20:56] <Dan2552> astro76: is there a good download manager you could recommend? flashget for windows is great
[20:56] <Fryguy--> blahabalah: probably
[20:56] <beni> juano: I mean LAN hostnames...
[20:56] <blahabalah> Fryguy: it booted up the first time
[20:56] <Fryguy--> blahabalah: so?
[20:57] <Jban> Dan2552: I was using Opera also Dan, but I ran into some sites that didn't support it very well (a university site or two).
[20:57] <Genotrius> Fryguy: I'm having resolution problems in Gusty, too. I actually changed xorg.conf to get my correct resolution while I was in Feisty, but it's set back to 1024 x 768 in Gusty.
[20:57] <Jban> Dan2552: So now I just went back to Firefox
[20:57] <juano> beni yep well i know it looks for domain names, but maybe since the router is having an issue resolving my own pc name, thats what the delay is all about
[20:57] <nsaba> Hi all , Is any  gutsy's  repository iso image available for download ?
[20:57] <kkathman> endo try running them from a terminal window and see if you get any error messages
[20:57] <Dan2552> Jban: i think compatabilities got quite a bit better in the later versions, even google pages works now
[20:57] <grndslm> I thought Gutsy was replacing Beagle with Tracker, is this correct?
[20:57] <astro76> Dan2552, not sure, I don't use one, there is flashget plugin for firefox... but I usually use wget in a termial
[20:57] <astro76> Dan2552, I think there are frontends for wget
[20:57] <flick> can i refresh the desktop manager without restarting gnome?
[20:57] <PriceChild> grndslm, by default. however either may be used.
[20:57] <MasterShrek> !mirrors | nsaba

[20:57] <Dan2552> astro76: omg i totally forgot about wget :p
[20:57] <rupertg> fryguy - I never managed to edit xorg.conf successfully
[20:58] <astro76> Dan2552, wget is great ;)
[20:58] <BHSPitLappy> Dan2552, wget -c
[20:58] <Fryguy--> rupertg: that's unfortunate
[20:58] <grndslm> PriceChild:  well, I was never a big fan of Beagle, can I disable it, just using tracker
[20:58] <rupertg> to be more precise, I never got the system to recognise the new resolutions, no matter how I tried
[20:58] <streather> hey guys im having a little problem getting my wifi card working
[20:58] <endo> kkathman:  how do I find the commands to run those applications? I don't know them off by heart
[20:58] <PriceChild> grndslm, beagle doesn't work by default afaik
[20:58] <Jban> astro76: Was AbiWord the other Office suite that was recommended to me?
[20:58] <mic> how i'm able to start xfce?
[20:58] <rupertg> but then, I never found a good explanation of how xorg,conf actually worked
[20:58] <PriceChild> grndslm, by "work", i mean its not enabled
[20:58] <kkathman> endo awn is awn I think :)
[20:58] <astro76> Jban, it's just a word processor
[20:58] <Dan2552> so is there a good wget frontend?
[20:59] <Seveas> PriceChild, it also doesn't work ;)
[20:59] <endo> nope, didn't work
[20:59] <Genotrius> Fryguy--: I'm having resolution problems in Gusty, too. I actually changed xorg.conf to get my correct resolution while I was in Feisty, but it's set back to 1024 x 768 in Gusty.
[20:59] <DUUUUUDE> anyone know how to make limewire download from more hosts? instead of 8 :/
[20:59] <PriceChild> Seveas, :)
[20:59] <astro76> Jban, it's part of gnome's "office suite"
[20:59] <MasterShrek> endo, go to the menu editor and edit the specific program and look at the command for it
[20:59] <hexno> anyone know what plugin is the one that lets windows stick out of my rotating cube?
[20:59] <sco50000> help please, i'm logged on as root in gutsy and it won't let me get into "System-->Administration-->Network"  it says: "The configuration could not be loaded      -    You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[20:59] <Fryguy--> Genotrius: i heard you the first time... why are you telling me this?  you edited it once, why not just edit it again?
[20:59] <grndslm> PriceChild:  well, beagle-helper is still running wild on my friends computer after a fresh cd upgrade to Gutsy...
[20:59] <Antiphonal> hexno, it is called 3d windows.
[20:59] <uvercinka> does anyone know how to compile on anjute 2.2
[20:59] <hexno> ty

[20:59] <nsaba> ubotu: thx , but I want iso images for complete repository on DVDs
[20:59] <FurryNemesis> sco50000, how are you logged in?
[20:59] <Flannel> sco50000: Why are you logged in to gnome as root?
[20:59] <sdasd> i am new with ubuntu can someone explain how to config  motorola usb surfband cable modem for internet?
[20:59] <Fryguy--> Jban: if you are having so many problems with alternative word processing applications, why not just use microsoft word?
[20:59] <streather> can anyone help?
[20:59] <nortcele> Hello, when i play Second Life my audio stutters terribly, this worked fine on fiesty but on gutsy its terrible.
[20:59] <Jban> Fryguy--: I dont want to use Windows?
[21:00] <nortcele> Any fixes
[21:00] <nsaba> ubotu: thx , but I want iso images for complete repository on DVDs
[21:00] <Genotrius> Fryguy: Because it hasn't changed. I have it up in the terminal right now, and it's exactly the same way I left it before I upgraded.
[21:00] <sco50000> i am logged in as root because i am setting up wireless network stuff
[21:00] <Antiphonal> VMWare is my friend for tricky MSOffice files that don't load in OpenOffice
[21:00] <Fryguy--> Jban: so don't? there's plenty of ways of running microsoft word without leaving linux
[21:00] <seanj> nortcele: I noticed that too with a couple apps... sound is stuttering and delayed but no idea why
[21:00] <Seveas> nsaba, those don't exist.
[21:00] <flick> can i setup some folders to be visible on a windows network on the laptop my wife uses?
[21:00] <Genotrius> And I still can't change to the proper resolution.
[21:00]  * DanaG uses Virtualbox.
[21:00]  * Dan2552 uses crossover
[21:00] <Seveas> flick, system -> admin -> shared folders
[21:00] <Fryguy--> vmware, qemu, virtualbox, wine, crossover office to name like 5.  And if you are having so many problems, why not just run windows?
[21:00] <DanaG> Seamless mode is cool, but I don't usually use it.
[21:00] <Flannel> sco50000: you don't need/want to be logged in as root, nor do you need to be logged in as root to setup wireless networking
[21:00] <Jban> Fryguy--: I'm not sure if you have been following what I've been discussing with astro, but it's been covered thoroughly already.
[21:00] <DanaG> My Windowblinds theme is a nice blue, and my Ubuntu theme is a nice orange.
[21:00]  * riotkittie uses virtualover and crossbox 
[21:01] <Altk> iwconfig lists my network, how do I connect to it now?

[21:01] <Antiphonal> VirtualBox is pretty sweet, but I already had DRM crap setup on the VMWare image. No transfer. :-(
[21:01] <DanaG> They look wonderful separately, but they clash if put together.
[21:01] <Fryguy--> Jban: I have been following, and I'm curious as to why you are still here instead of following the numerous suggestions given
[21:01] <MasterShrek> riotkittie, whats crossbox?
[21:01] <nsaba> Seveas: but I've seen that for feitsy and all previous releases
[21:01] <bulmer> Altk: try dhclient wlant0
[21:01] <rupertg> genotrius: I think there are definitely issues here, I've seen people mention them on various forums. I wish I knew the best forum to hang out in to find out what's actually going on.
[21:01] <Tarkus> for adding codecs for restricted formats (gstreamer, etc..).. do i install the same way as i did in 7.04?
[21:01] <sco50000> well, i still want to know why i can;t open this as root
[21:01] <flick> Seveas, thanks
[21:01] <omegaweopon> If I downloaded the .deb for virtualbox and ran it, how would I access it?  I tried running it but nothing came up, and it didnt install into my applications menu
[21:01] <Seveas> nsaba, the repository is way too big for one dvd
[21:01] <riotkittie> MasterShrek: nothing, really <hides>
[21:01] <lauchazombie> jdong, finally i decide to try deluge hahahahha
[21:01] <MasterShrek> sco50000, sudo?
[21:01] <Seveas> so you're talking rubbish :)
[21:01] <grndslm> Nobody else who upgraded to Gutsy still has beagled-helper running?
[21:01] <Jban> Fryguy--: I am, but that doesnt mean that I am not entitled to still be here and ask questions that come to mind.
[21:01] <MasterShrek> lol @ riotkittie
[21:01] <jdong> lauchazombie: awesome
[21:01] <streather> s
[21:01] <sco50000> MasterShrek: what?
[21:01] <Altk> bulmer: thanx worked
[21:02] <Antiphonal> omegaweopon, it showed up in my applications menu.
[21:02] <MasterShrek> sco50000, use sudo to run things as root
[21:02] <astro76> omegaweopon, to find the command try: dpkg -L packagename | grep bin
[21:02] <nsaba> Seveas: yes , it was 4 DVDs for feitsy , and will be about 6 for gutsy
[21:02] <sdasd> someone know how to config usb cable modem?

[21:02] <sco50000> MasterShrek: i know
[21:02] <gabbarinho> I am having problems booting to ubuntu
[21:02] <Fryguy--> Jban: it certainly doesn't except you are pretty much wasting our time at this point.  qemu, virtualbox, vmware, crossover office, wine, abiword, openoffice, suck it up and boot to windows to run office.  one of those solutions is guaranteed to be the answer to your question.  Go do some research and figure out which suits your needs the best
[21:02] <sco50000> MasterShrek: but why can't i open the network manager?
[21:02] <DUUUUUDE> anyone know how to make limewire download from more hosts? instead of 8 :/ msg me please
[21:02] <MasterShrek> riotkittie, does it have alot of nice packages? worth a download?
[21:02] <gabbarinho> with the Live CD, I had trouble installing it; I've installed it with the alternate CD, but it still won't boot
[21:02] <MasterShrek> sco50000, whats the error?
[21:03] <Seveas> !repeat | DUUUUUDE

[21:03] <Pete1234> Seveas: many thanks i just hadn't enabled all the repositories. it confused me as i used dapperfor a while and used to see all of them,
[21:03] <Antiphonal> Anyone have tips for getting the Gutsy livecd to boot? X keeps restarting and I have to reboot.
[21:03] <alromaithi> kubuntu ( compiz System tray icon ) how to get that running? so i can have wide range of controls
[21:03] <Fryguy--> Antiphonal: you try the safe graphics mode? second option on the list

[21:03] <erat123> I'm trying to configure a dns server on ubuntu server.  The attempt is to decrease my ping rate so i can play online games faster.  can anyone throw some expertise my way?

[21:03] <Jban> Fryguy--: Alright, you know what, the only one who is wasting your time is you by talking down to me.  I'm not wasting time by asking a question, and you are choosing to respond to me when you weren't helping to begin with.  Thanks for making me feel welcomed.
[21:03] <omegaweopon> Ok I think I found it using you command but now how do I run it? Its in usr/bin
[21:03] <sco50000> it won't let me get into "System-->Administration-->Network"  it says: "The configuration could not be loaded      -    You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[21:03] <MasterShrek> lol riotkittie then whats the point of carrying them around?
[21:03] <Seveas> Romme, if it depends on them, they are needed
[21:03] <Antiphonal> Fryguy, I tried it. Same error. :-(
[21:03] <garu> I just realised what my big wireless problem is
[21:04] <Fryguy--> Jban: what do you want from us man.  I just gave you SEVERAL solutions to your problem, what more do you want
[21:04]  * nsaba searching for complete repository  DVD ISO images !!!
[21:04] <riotkittie> MasterShrek: fashion statement. :x
[21:04] <joerack> beni: I have a question on virtualbox: Can I install on a native harddisk (not virtual) like vmware does?
[21:04] <MasterShrek> omegaweopon, just type the name of the executable
[21:04] <streather> anyone know how to get a intel pro wireless 3945 working properly in the new version of ubuntu?, its saying that the restricted drivers are installed but its not actually picking up a wifi card at all
[21:04] <Seveas> Fryguy--, please relax
[21:04] <Antiphonal> Radeon X1650 works fine in 7.04.
[21:04]  * nsaba is searching for complete repository  DVD ISO images !!!
[21:04] <Flannel> nsaba: Just create your own with ndiswrapper
[21:04] <Seveas> nsaba, stop repeating
[21:04] <Flannel> nsaba: and please stop repeating
[21:04] <PriceChild> nsaba, make them yourself with !aptoncd
[21:04] <fatcatmatt> joerack: yes
[21:04] <PriceChild> Flannel, ndiswrapper?
[21:04] <Fryguy--> Jban: this is an extremely busy channel, I'm sitting here spending a few hours trying to help out some people, and instead I get people  yelling at me when I concisely give them 5+ solutions to their problem, that's awesome
[21:04] <sco50000> MasterShrek: it won't let me get into "System-->Administration-->Network"  it says: "The configuration could not be loaded      -    You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[21:04] <Seveas> PriceChild, aptoncd can't handle that much ;)
[21:04] <fatcatmatt> joerack: do you have msn messenger?
[21:04] <kevin_> anyone know where i can get themes other than gnome-look?
[21:04] <Flannel> PriceChild: sorry, no idea where that came from.  nsaba, I meant aptoncd
[21:04] <Fryguy--> Seveas: lol
[21:04] <bulmer> sco50000: can you log on as root or can you sudo ip a ?
[21:04] <joerack> cool, must be a really good program
[21:04] <akorn> hey does anybody know how i can use Emerald themes with Compiz-Fusion running?
[21:05] <Pete1234> ubotu sounds like that guy from Zoolander
[21:05] <MasterShrek> riotkittie, interesting, i didnt know debian was fashionable
[21:05] <PriceChild> Seveas, maybe you should try harder :P
[21:05] <Fryguy--> akorn: emerald --replace
[21:05] <PriceChild> !offtopic > Pete1234
[21:05] <Dan2552> kevin_: you could make your own :)
[21:05] <Stormx2> Fryguy--, happens. Calm yourself :)
[21:05] <sco50000> bulmer: i am logged on as root right now
[21:05] <akorn> Fryguy: where?
[21:05] <Gigglez> hi
[21:05] <MasterShrek> sco50000, can that user use sudo? like in a terminal?
[21:05] <PriceChild> !root | sco50000
[21:05] <ubotu> sco50000: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth.. there is no root password. Then you will see that it is sudo that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[21:05] <Jban> Fryguy--: What are you talking about? I am taking all the advice astro gave me fine. I wasnt asking for any more help, just asking knowledge questions. Dont TYPE if you are BUSY.
[21:05] <Romme> Seveas: well, i can install it by hand, and it will work without them, but is there a way to stop the package manager to complain about missing dependencies then?
[21:05] <Fryguy--> akorn: anywhere you can type a command in
[21:05] <joerack> fatcatmatt: have to install it... skype?
[21:05] <Gigglez> i have this error :  dependency is not satisfiable : linux-image-generic
[21:05] <kevin_> Dan2552: haha, im not so sure about my artistic skills... gnome-look is down :F
[21:05] <erat123> I'm trying to configure a dns server on ubuntu server.  The attempt is to decrease my ping rate so i can play online games faster.  can anyone throw some expertise my way?
[21:05] <fatcatmatt> joerack: nope, just msn
[21:05] <Gigglez> any idea ?
[21:05] <akorn> Fryguy: so in console just put that in?
[21:05] <sco50000> MasterShrek: yes
[21:05] <Fryguy--> akorn: sure
[21:05] <Seveas> Gigglez, your sources.list is busted or you're not on x86 :)
[21:05] <lamego> eracc, a dns server is not relevant for game play
[21:06] <akorn> Fryguy: wow haha that was simple...thanks!
[21:06] <Flare183> kevin_:> then use opendesktop.org
[21:06] <Varanger> !codecs

[21:06] <kevin1> hello Im wondering if someone can help me, On my workstation I have a extra partition (sda4), and I have another pc (PC-2). I want to set up a ssh folder on PC-2 so I can browse the extra partition on my workstation. When I go to Places>Connect to server and choose ssh, i enter the ip address of my workstation, but what i cant figure out is what folder to open, i try /mnt/sda4, and /dev/sda4 but they dont work, any ideas?
[21:06] <ckin2001> erat123, how will that help your game?
[21:06] <Antiphonal> Jban, what is the question?
[21:06] <Antiphonal> jban, what was your question?
[21:06] <seanj> erat123: I doubt running a DNS server will improve your ping
[21:06] <Gigglez> Seveas, i am on i386 how can i resolve it ?
[21:06] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> Does any1 use Parallels Workstation with the new Ubuntu release ?
[21:06] <sco50000> bulmer: i logged on as root at logon screen
[21:06] <haru> flash player for firefox isnt producing sound.. any ideas??

[21:06] <Jban> Antiphonal: I dont have any more questions... that's what I as trying to say to fry... astro did a fine job helping me out.
[21:06] <akorn> Anybody know how to make the windows get that 3D look with compiz (i'm too used to using beryl)
[21:06] <sdasd> can somebody help me with makin internet connection with motorola usb cabl modem?
[21:06] <Varanger> Does anyone know if mplayer has problems in Gutsy?
[21:06] <Fryguy--> Antiphonal: he wants to edit word documents, and open office isn't meeting his needs
[21:06] <akorn> when you spin the cube...
[21:06] <Gigglez> Seveas, how ?
[21:06] <Seveas> !sources.list | Gigglez

[21:06] <Altk> MasterShrek: sudo-apt get commands you gave didn't resolve the issue.
[21:06] <omegaweopon> Ok I found the virtual box exectutable, how do I put a shortcut into my applications menu?
[21:06] <Antiphonal> Ahhh, good deal then. Sorry - I have a lot of experience running windows apps on Linux. Thought I could lend.
[21:07] <streather> guys?
[21:07] <Stormx2> omegaweopon: Right click applications > edit menus

[21:07] <grndslm> ok, after a fresh upgrade on my friends computer from Dapper to Gutsy, Beagle is still running... how do I disable it?
[21:07] <flick> how can i see and operate another laptop in the same workgroup by remote desktop?
[21:07] <sauvin> dmesg is glutted with what look like firewall "I blocked this access attempt" messages. Is there any way to divert these messages to someplace else? dmesg is so crowded with access attempt blocks that I can't get info on OTHER events.
[21:07] <PriceChild> !msgthebot > DUUUUUDE (see the pm from ubotu)
[21:07] <sco50000> MasterShrek: it didn't do anything when i typed that in
[21:07] <MasterShrek> Altk, it was worth a shot, try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
[21:07] <akorn> Fryguy: Thanks...also now that i have emerald themes running, they worked for 2 seconds and now i have no bars ont he tops of my screens haha
[21:07] <kevin_> hey can someone check and see if they can get to gnome-looks.org for me -- I think i might have a dns problem
[21:07] <captine> from what i can see, there is no proper support for smartphones/blackberry's,  right?
[21:07] <haru> flash player for firefox isnt producing sound.. any ideas??
[21:07] <erat123> ckin2001: i've heard it's possible to decrease ping rate by setting up a server that can resolve names locally instead of going out on the cloud and resolving names.  maybe that's wrong
[21:07] <Fryguy--> akorn: did it happen after you closed the terminal?
[21:07] <grndslm> flick:  ssh -X username@192.168.1.x
[21:07] <joerack> I see virtualbox is donateware
[21:07] <akorn> Fryguy: Yup
[21:07] <Seveas> kevin_, it's gnome-look.org ;)
[21:07] <MasterShrek> sco50000, interesting, i should think it would, or at least tell you the file wasnt found
[21:07] <Fryguy--> if so, then hit alt-f2 and type the command again
[21:07] <joerack> cool
[21:08] <Gigglez> Seveas, thanks
[21:08] <Antiphonal> Akorn, try typing emerald --replace &, then typing exit.
[21:08] <Flare183> kevin_:> yeah sure
[21:08] <Fryguy--> akorn: into the window that pops up
[21:08] <bulmer> sauvin: look at your firewall rules to see if any is logging
[21:08] <seanj> running a DNS server won't improve your ping

[21:08] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> Does any1 use Parallels Workstation with the new Ubuntu release ?
[21:08] <Jban> Antiphonal: I'd hate to beat a dead horse by asking any more questions about it; don't want to get talked down to again. I'm new to Linux, and was only continuing to talk about it to educate myself about additional topics that related to it.  But thanks.
[21:08] <akorn> Fryguy: worked like a charm...thanks again haha
[21:08] <sauvin> bulmer: firstarter.
[21:08] <sco50000> mastershrek: it won't let me get into "System-->Administration-->Network"  it says: "The configuration could not be loaded      -    You are not allowed to access the system configuration."
[21:08] <ckin2001> erat123, once you have the dns lookup it caches the address for a long time, so that you dont go out on the "cloud" but once per addy
[21:08] <sco50000> oops
[21:08] <Dan2552> kevin_: try gnome-look.org
[21:08] <sco50000> nvm

[21:10] <sco50000> why did i get kicked?
[21:10] <Seveas> Powerking89670, vlc

[21:10] <gabbarinho> does anyone have ubuntu hang before booting?
[21:10] <Powerking89670> looks like the concensus is VLC
[21:10] <nortcele> anybody have a solution for the gutsy stuttering problem
[21:10] <Dan2552> smallfoot-: windows button
[21:10] <Flannel> smallfoot-: usually the windows button by default

[21:10] <Fryguy--> akorn: linux is pretty obvious, google has a large wealth of information available for any conceivable problem, most of the time people ask questions in here and I just google the answers and repeat them in here.  I get yelled at when telling people to just google for themselves, so I just do it for them
[21:11] <magnetron> !dvd > Powerking89670
[21:11] <sco50000> MasterShrek: should i reboot?
[21:11] <bulmer> gabbarinho: yes..so restart the boot process
[21:11] <Pete1234> PriceChild: i had finished my question, so it wasn't technically offtopic ;-)
[21:11] <attunix> astro76: I'm not sure
[21:11] <windows_convert> i have a problem installing 7.04; i boot up from the cd and everything appears to load fine, however then i get an x-window error and get dumped to the command line
[21:11] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> its one of the best if not thee best Powerking89670
[21:11] <smallfoot-> Dan2552, Fl3gma, Flare183, oh thanks guys
[21:11] <benzss> VLC is easily the best multimedia app available... mplayer and totem are so fickle
[21:11] <Flare183> np
[21:11] <omegaweopon> Ok time for more questions.  When it asks how much memeory I want to allocate to it, is that asking me how much it WILL set aside, or the max it can set aside?
[21:11] <MasterShrek> Altk, try reinstalling your gdm maybe, sudo apt-get remove gdm  then sudo apt-get install gdm
[21:11] <astro76> attunix, you really should for qt development, it's a great ide for anything especially qt
[21:11] <Antiphonal> Omega - max.
[21:11] <Powerking89670> magnetron: thanks :D
[21:11] <Altk> ok.
[21:11] <Stormx2> windows_convert: Could you give us the error?

[21:11] <MasterShrek> sco50000, i didnt tell you to reconfigure your gdm

[21:11] <attunix> astro76: cool thanks :)
[21:11] <ScottAS> My current Ubuntu Linux 7.04 installation is broken in that it can't see its root partition in order to begin booting. Would I be able to insert an Ubuntu Linux 7.10 installation CD-R and install it, thus having it upgrade the Ubuntu Linux 7.04 installation or would it simply overwrite it?
[21:11] <Fryguy--> akorn: the ops get mad at me when I tell people to google
[21:12] <Varanger> Does anyone know if mplayer has problems in Gutsy?
[21:12] <omegaweopon> So if I set it to 700 megs linux can still perform well and the only comflict will occur when I somehow use that much memory?
[21:12] <Seveas> Fryguy--, just google it ;)
[21:12] <Gigglez> Seveas, it is a new install so i don't understand how it can be broken : /
[21:12] <Antiphonal> Windows will try to use the memory for cache.
[21:12] <MasterShrek> sco50000, as far as that netowrk thing not opening, its probably not a big deal, just use the command line for networking, thats what i do
[21:12] <techjim> in feisty, I would plug my ipod into my firewire port.  now, with gutsy, I'll plug my ipod into the firewire port but the /media/device doesn't mount.  what's the deal?
[21:12] <Antiphonal> So, a bad idea.
[21:12] <omegaweopon> I have .99 gigs of RAM
[21:12] <Fryguy--> akorn: even though 80% of the time I get an answer from the I'm feeling lucky result, and 95% of the time the answer is on the first page
[21:12] <Antiphonal> I'd go 256 unless you NEEDED more for some app.
[21:12] <akorn> Fryguy: hahaha really? google's got an answer for AYNTHIGN linux...or they could go to any ubuntu forum and find it out....it's just sometimes way quicker to ask in here ;)

[21:12] <omegaweopon> Well I plan on playing games on it
[21:12] <astro76> Fryguy--, I think it would be acceptable to provide a google link ;)
[21:12] <windows_convert> Stormx2, it's saying that it can't find a supported video mode for x-window to run
[21:12] <attunix> Dan2552: you mean off the live cd?
[21:12] <Antiphonal> what kind of games, omega?
[21:12] <spinoza> currently you can only ftp to my ubuntu server via ssh i want to enable regular ftp access how do I ?
[21:13] <Dan2552> attunix: i mean copy the entire live cd to ram, and run
[21:13] <Stormx2> windows_convert: Eek. Just a default 6.10 live cd?
[21:13] <omegaweopon> The kind that WINE doesnt like >.>  It hates gameguard

[21:14] <Jban> astro76: Does Word make two different types of files for the same document? I've noticed that sometimes... weird.

[21:14] <slipttees> ayo
[21:14] <DRuNKeN-MAsTEr> Has any1 been able to use Parallels Workstation v2.2 with the new Ubuntu release ? Which of the two would you recommend ?
[21:14] <Antiphonal> Omega, I'd be wary of anything over 1/2 your memory.
[21:14] <Stormx2> windows_convert: Could you verify the CD? It's an option as soon as the CD loads.
[21:14] <Antiphonal> So, I guess for you - 512.
[21:14] <Fryguy--> omegaweopon: 15GB is a reasonable maximum to set aside for ubuntu, you cna set aside much less than that if you desire.  my current install is using just over 3 GB, and that's reasonably full featured
[21:14] <astro76> fronthat's ok, once you install go to system > administration > restricted drivers manager and check the Broadcom one
[21:14] <slipttees> ubuntu 7.10 don't have LTS support ?
[21:14] <omegaweopon> I think I could go with 512 seeing as how thats what my OLD laptop worked
[21:14] <dopel> Seveas, is there an easy way of installing the NTLDR without messing up either install?
[21:14] <Pici> slipttees: correct.

[21:27] <Paxton> PeacefulCheet1: Well we need to know the model of the router or at least the model of your card
[21:27] <oxeimo2> does anyone here have compiz working on a dual-head ati setup?
[21:27] <Puppy_> Is it possible that my computer is slower after upgrading?
[21:27] <bulmer> kamesh_: then fix up your internet access?
[21:28] <Paxton> PeacefulCheet1: Or if you're using one of those USB adapters like I am, that.
[21:28] <N-i-X> on the internet i found a link to a file that stars with deb... its "deb http://url...."   how do i install it?

[21:28] <Fryguy--> optx: make sure your repositories are properly set up, because it's definetely there
[21:28] <Adlai> optx: it's in universe, so you might have to enable some repos
[21:28] <Tranto1> Probably you are using incorrect authenitcation mode (WPA, WEP...). I think Gutsy has WPA enabled

[21:28] <N-i-X> bulmer man dkpg deb url?

[21:28] <Adlai> bengt_: google

[21:28] <jnc> Burlynn: any reason you are not doing an NFS mount?

[21:28] <bulmer> N-i-X: man dpkg on a terminal
[21:29] <bengt_> Thanks
[21:29] <Paxton> PeacefulCheet1: ndiswrapper is probably your best hope for that sort of thing. the ubuntu forums usually has a post for how to make your wifi work if you just search for the model
[21:29] <Fryguy--> bengt_: just install ubuntu, it's installation process takes care of everything necessary to dual boot
[21:29] <Burlynn> jnc, well i read through the nfs wiki page and it justs seems rather complicated
[21:29] <Kaitlyn2004> my friend has windows and downloading the .ISO from ubuntu.com... is it possible for them to install it without first burning to a cd?
[21:29] <bulmer> !dpkg |N-i-X

[21:29] <Paxton> Tranto1: I agree. I'm impressed
[21:29] <Pinchiukas> ubotu
[21:29] <PeacefulCheet1> Paxton:it's WMP54G, and it's a PCI card
[21:29] <Fryguy--> Kaitlyn2004: no, you can't properly install an operating system from inside of another operating system (unless you are doing virtualization or other things that aren't really proper OS installs)
[21:30] <Lejzi> !wlan
[21:30] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[21:30] <jnc> Burlynn: it's rather simple. you will need nfs-common installed.  then edit /etc/exports on the "server" machine.  then mount from the client.  that is an oversimplification, but there is no complicated ACL or further configuration needed
[21:30] <emsyr> Pinchiukas: Try the free driver to see. I had problems with the restricted. The free one has been OK (for me).

[21:30] <ubotu> Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (type also /msg ubotu Bot). Also avoid adding joke/useless factoids. Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[21:30] <jnc> Burlynn: alternatively, you can install autofs on the client, and navigate to /net/your.host.name/  and the NFS mount will appear
[21:30] <Dan2552> :( i'm sorry

[21:31] <neopsyche_> Hi, Im wanting to set up a server for a fairly vast network of users on an ISP to be able to feed them files through a server on the network.   I have a P4 which i am using and a lesser celeron machine... i want to setup a website on a LAMP server that will allow users to browse the site.. would it be secure if i hosted it on my OWN pc? or should i rather go for the CELERON pc? and setup ubuntu on that one?_
=== mcnesium_ is now known as mcnesium
[21:31] <crossout> jessie^^, just by mentioning name?
[21:31] <crossout> did it work?
[21:32] <jessie^^> yup

[21:32] <tapas> i use the mplayer plugin in firefox.. on some vids it caches, then it should start but it just blinks and continues to cache
[21:32] <crossout> oh nice thanks :)
[21:32] <youknowme> jnc, what do you need to know? wghat COULD be the problem?
[21:32] <Seveas> neopsyche_, either will work
[21:32] <Paxton> PeacefulCheet1: Alright. Are you using gutsy? On the forums some guy got your card working out of the box in gutsy
[21:32] <LordLimecat> im having a bunch of issues with my soundcard, and i really dont feel like taking the 10 hours to deal with it, i could just reinstall gutsy over top of my current install without wiping the data, right?
[21:32] <tapas> more and more and it never stops ;)
=== neopsyche_ is now known as neopsyche
[21:32] <jnc> neopsyche_: what do you mean "browse the site"
[21:32] <MenZa> Nope, LordLimecat
[21:32] <tapas> LordLimecat: i doubt that instllig over it wil fix you r soundcard "issues"
[21:32] <PeacefulCheet1> Paxton: Yes I am, the problem I'm having is that I keep getting a prompt for the WEP key
[21:32] <tapas> LordLimecat: what are those issues btw?
[21:32] <MenZa> Unless you have seperate /home and / partitions.
[21:33] <neopsyche> I want to setup a website on the server that people will be able to log into. To get files.

[21:33] <astro76> LordLimecat, only if you have a separate /home partition
[21:33] <Tranto1> PeacefulCheet1: did you try to configure it in Network manager, instead in the prompt you see?
[21:33] <jnc> tony: what is "h0 Master"

[21:33] <MenZa> tony: I do that.
[21:33] <thedonvaughn> tony: there is "master" in SATA.  You just setup grub to boot your sata disc and install]

[21:38] <LiMaO> joerack: get the appropriate .deb file on that site and install it. you'll have a fully working virtualbox installation

[21:38] <neopsyche> Does anyone know what the buton is to press to get a uers name in front of a sentence in xchat ? (for last user who replied) like in GAIM/PIdgion you just press tab.? tab
[21:38] <volvirflaneur> I'm having problems starting Jack with Gutsy. Any help?
[21:38] <jnc> Tranto1: something like tar jcvpf $HOME /tmp/home-backup.tbz2
[21:38] <joerack> Limao: I've already downloaded and installed virtualbox with repositories, and am stuck that I cannot start the console. Can i rewrite everything with this other method?
[21:39] <jnc> neopsyche: it's configurable
[21:39] <MasterShrek> neopsyche, tab
[21:39] <crossout> MasterShrek, damn, well that means I pretty much I have to repair it I guess, since there is no way I'm gona format. Thanks for you help though, nice to know how to revert the Master Boot :).
[21:39] <neopsyche> tab not working
[21:39] <neopsyche> jnc where do i configure it?
[21:39] <Odd-rationale> Tranto1: Try this: http://lubi.sourceforge.net/bubakup.html
[21:39] <astro76> neopsyche, most people use tab completion with the first few letters, you can change a setting in the xchat preferences to make it prefer nicks that have recently spoken
[21:39] <jnc> neopsyche: I don't use xchat
[21:39] <kevin1> how do i automount a partition on my hd?
[21:39] <LiMaO> joerack: forget about what you have installed. download the .deb and install this new .deb - it'll overwrite what you have downloaded using apt-get
[21:39] <jnc> neopsyche: when I did use xchat some years ago, it was configurable
[21:39] <jnc> sorry
[21:39] <MasterShrek> no prob crossout, try booting that windows disc again, then hitting enter when it loads up and when it finds your existing windows install tell it to repair it, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt
[21:39] <neopsyche> what do you use jnc?
[21:39] <jrgp> I just upgraded to gutsy and my sound quality sucks. Before it didn't. My sound card is integrated into my nforce4 mb.
[21:40] <jnc> neopsyche: irssi
[21:40] <jnc> neopsyche: it's much nicer I think
[21:40] <neopsyche> Im using xchat because.. i find gaim better for IM's
[21:40] <Joshooa> anybody else having problems with 3d effects and desktop cube in 7.10?
[21:40] <neopsyche> irssi?
[21:40] <joerack> Limao: it will also install the kernel drivers?
[21:40] <Tranto1> jnc: thanks, I can make a copy of /home directory, but I've configured many other things, like kernel boot options (specifical of my laptop), and I would like to preserve all these options if I can't configure all of them in Gutsy. I heard about 'ghost', but not sure if that would be helpful
[21:40] <astro76> neopsyche, indeed, gaim is horrible for irc ;)
[21:40] <LiMaO> joerack: yes. it will install everything that is needed.
[21:40] <jnc> neopsyche: irssi is for the terminal, so I don't need X11
[21:40] <crossout> MasterShrek, k thank you, cya later :).
[21:40] <Kaitlyn2004> I installed emerald.. and go to sys->prefs->emerald theme manager.. but I can't seem to CHANGE the theme?
[21:40] <kevin1> how do i automount a new partition on my hard drive?
[21:40] <astro76> Tranto1, partimage is like "ghost"
[21:40] <Colro> i changed a setting on compiz config manager that made my windows minimize/maximize and my cube rotate ALOT slower, does anyone know what i messed up? :/
[21:40] <Jban> Joshooa: I had to turn my effects off and then turn them back on in Appearance, and then everything worked correctly... but that was just me.
[21:40] <LiMaO> kevin1: add it to the /etc/fstab file
[21:41] <MasterShrek> Kaitlyn2004, is emerald running?
[21:41] <joerack> Limao: cool. thanks a lot
[21:41] <neopsyche> ponders how to configrue keys to do stuff in xchat
[21:41] <davidthedrake> Can someone please tell me how to downgrade from Gutsy back to Feisty?
[21:41] <Kaitlyn2004> MasterShrek: umm not sure... haha
[21:41] <jrgp> where can I find updated sound card drivers?
[21:41] <astro76> davidthedrake, you can't
[21:41] <Pici> davidthedrake: reinstall.
[21:41] <LiMaO> joerack: you're welcome. if you happen to have any problem with it, just tell me here, i'll try and help ya
[21:41] <Tranto1> astro76: so, can partimage save my current installation in a CD, DVD? And then, once saved... is this CD bootable?
[21:41] <LiMaO> davidthedrake: format and reinstall
[21:41] <davidthedrake> Wonderful.
[21:41] <LiMaO> =D

=== Carnage` is now known as Carnage\
[21:41] <kst-> how come my gutsy boots much slower than feisty? and where did the boot splash go?
[21:41] <kevin1> what about all this i have no idea hoe to create this info UUID=0f0d555b-796f-402d-8b05-9c80e8ea5d86 none swap sw 0 0
[21:42] <astro76> Tranto1, yes it's a complete imaging and restoration system. Get the system rescue cd.
[21:42] <kevin1> LiMaO:
[21:42] <LiMaO> i guess gutsy is the most troublesome release ever heh
[21:42] <tony> thedonvaughn: Okay, so does it matter that my old IDE drive is h0 in the BIOS and SDA in my Ubuntu setup? It's empty. The problem is that whenever I have a kernel upgrade, I have to go into /boot/grub/menu.lst and change it up to get Ubuntu to load.
[21:42] <Joshooa> I get some desktop effects but no matter what no cube, once I had a flat screen i could flip over but that's gone now too
[21:42] <LiMaO> considering the huge amount of people with problems
[21:42] <jnc> Tranto1: oh.   if you boot a SysRescCd or similar live cd distro, you can mount your partitions and backup the information from them.  You can just do a full gzip compressed disk image, a tarball, or whatever.  Tar at least knows how to preserve file permissions if you tell it to
[21:42] <kamesh_> Hi all, well when I type.. sudo apt-get update.. it says Err http://archive.ubuntu.com gutsy Release.gpg, Could not connect to archive.ubuntu.com:80 (1.0.0.0), connection timed out....I know that I have a working internet connection because I am using it right now
[21:42] <Tranto1> astro76: many thanks, I will try it. This is what I was looking for
[21:42] <stemount> 7.10 works fantastic here LiMaO :(
[21:42] <jnc> Tranto1: the functionally easy way to do this is borrow a spare hard disk
[21:42] <jnc> ;)
[21:42] <LiMaO> kevin1: yes?
[21:42] <Kaitlyn2004> MasterShrek: thanks! haha I was running "replace --emerald"
[21:42] <Colro> i changed a setting on compiz config manager that made my windows minimize/maximize and my cube rotate ALOT slower, does anyone know what i messed up? :/
[21:42] <kst-> I think I'll go back to feisty :( or can anyone tell me a good reason why I should use gutsy?
[21:42] <akorn> Anybody here know how to make the windows look separated when rotating cube in Compiz?
[21:42] <MasterShrek> LiMaO, not really, people always tend to have these same problems when upgrading lol
[21:42] <scottfro> hello
[21:43] <jnc> kst-: you like to complain = use Gutsy
[21:43] <jnc> heh
[21:43] <kevin1> LiMaO:  what about all this i have no idea hoe to create this info UUID=0f0d555b-796f-402d-8b05-9c80e8ea5d86 none swap sw 0 0
[21:43] <LiMaO> stemount: wanna see that it doesn't?! change your theme to 'crux' then load openoffice writer.. and try to format a page.. it'll hang ;)
[21:43] <oxeimo2> I'm using an open-source ati driver, why can't I enable desktop effects?
[21:43] <scottfro> i am a totally noob to linux and was hoping to get a little help
[21:43] <DUUUUUDE> i extracted the files from frostwire-4.13.3.i586.deb, now what?
[21:43] <stemount> o rly :(
[21:43] <MasterShrek> ScottAS, whats your problem?
[21:43] <LiMaO> kevin1: you may skip the uuid part
[21:43] <scottfro> i goofed up my xorg file so someone recommended i delete it and it should get recreated
[21:43] <jnc> scottfro: haven't noticed you asking a question
[21:43] <athem> how do i make ubuntu 7.10 turn off my computer after shutting down?

[21:43] <scottfro> so i deleted it and my problem was fixed so i assumed it was recreated
[21:43] <threeseas> so you have to ghave alot of gutsy to upgrade ehhh?

[21:44] <Lejzi> did anyone had problems in gutsy with wlan0 and wmaster0 and ndwrapper didnt solve the problem ??
[21:44] <jnc> Korg: more ram, please
[21:44] <oxeimo2> why can't I enable desktop effects w/ my open source ati driver?
[21:45] <Korg> lol
[21:45] <Tranto1> jnc: I have a 250 Gb external disk, but I would like to go back to my previous system using some kind of wizard, and seems that partimage can do this...
[21:45] <kevin1> LiMaO:  Im not sure what to put, I want a sda4, or media/disk to be writable by all users
[21:45] <Korg> not here...
[21:45] <jnc> Korg: gnome desktop alone eats up 400mb
[21:45] <HPM> When I start Azureus, it flashes the main window for 1-2 seconds and then quits. Any ideas?
[21:45] <ExRarne> Hey, I had problems with Ubuntu so I deleted the partition, but GRUB still expects it to be there and gives me an error, how do I get my PC to boot into XP normally?
[21:45] <kamesh_> Hi all, well when I type.. sudo apt-get update.. it says Err http://archive.ubuntu.com gutsy Release.gpg, Could not connect to archive.ubuntu.com:80 (1.0.0.0), connection timed out....I know that I have a working internet connection because I am using it right now
[21:45] <ScottAS> MasterShrek: I upgraded openSUSE Linux 10.2 to openSUSE Linux 10.3, it re-insalled the GRUB Boot Loader. I had it installed alongside Ubuntu Linux 7.04 and I now can't boot Ubuntu Linux 7.04 because it can't parse the root partition's UUID in order to boot.
[21:45] <riotkittie> Korg:  i hope thats gutsy xubuntu style :o
[21:45] <dansku> how can I install  pyGTK-devel to make Listen work?
[21:45] <jnc> Tranto1: oh, "wizard" hmm.  don't know of any
[21:45] <Korg> so the " it works on older machine" line can be scrapped?
[21:45] <Tranto1> jnc: you know what I mean... Next -> Next -> Finish :)
[21:46] <jack> Does anyone know how to get a Wacom table working with my monitors in TwinView mode?
[21:46] <MasterShrek> ScottAS, edit the /etc/fstab on the ubuntu partition and change the uuid to the actualy /dev/xxxx  device
[21:46] <MasterShrek> actual*
[21:46] <riotkittie> ScottAS: then change uuid to good old fashioned /dev/whatever
[21:46] <zerotime> hi, does anyone know about fps games available for linux?
[21:46] <jnc> Tranto1: I just memorized some commands, I do this all the time.  Too lazy for GUI
[21:46] <scottfro> ok soi i'm running this reconfigure thing, what do i choose for my video chipset if it doesnt' auto detect?
[21:46] <neopsyche> hotkeys for xchat ?
[21:46] <jnc> oh my god lovely barbeque smells
[21:46] <Lejzi> zerotime: i think quake is available for linux
[21:46]  * jnc moans
[21:46] <LiMaO> kevin1: sorry, i'm a little busy right now, but now that you know what you have to do, just ask in the channel how to add an entry into fstab.. someone will guide you through it
[21:46] <tony> Question: Whenever /boot/grub/menu.lst is updated, I have to go in and fix file to get it to boot. This appears to be because my storage IDE drive is hd0 and SDA, while my SATA drive is hd1 and SDB. Is there a way to fix this so when menu.lst is updated I don't get Error 22?
[21:47] <ScottAS> MasterShrek: Are there no tools that'll re-install the GRUB boot loader for me and re-organise it so that I can boot into either Operating System?
[21:47] <MasterShrek> zerotime, sauerbraten
[21:47] <Colro> Is there a way to reset my compiz advanced settings back to default? i messed something up and all of my animations are EXTREMELY slow now........
[21:47] <zerotime> Lejzi, I am looking for a site to see whats aviable
[21:47] <kevin1> LiMaO:  what about: /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 01
[21:47] <amigamax> ditto on compiz
[21:47] <kevin1> oh sorry LiMaO

[21:47] <slipttees> Intel bought a iMac, which version of ubuntu working on it?
[21:47] <kevin1> ty
[21:47] <tony> Sorry to anyone I didn't respond to upthread about this. I had to go for a second
[21:48] <MasterShrek> ScottAS, it sounds like youll be able to boot ubuntu if you just change that in the /etc/fstab on the ubuntu partition, im not sure how the uuid is assigned, but ive heard of it changing
[21:48] <riotkittie> Tranto1: why not just leave your feisty install intact [you are not hurting for disk space with 200+GB!], create a partition for gutsy and install alongside?
[21:48] <Tranto1> jnc: I'm too lazy for commands :) well, really what I want is a process that configure Grub in a correct way, and restore the system. I'm not sure I'm able to do this only making a copy of the files in my linux partition
[21:48] <juanbond> Is VMWare Server available for gutsy in the repository yet?  If not, does anyone know when, or how I can install vmware server right now.
[21:48] <Korg> hmm can scrap this xrappy wifi to...lol
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> so... does anyone here STILL use Windows?
[21:48] <Odd-rationale> Colro: Do you have the compiz-config-settings-manager?
[21:48] <headphase> hello, I tried to install a webcam and now my tv tunercard is no longer recognized
[21:48] <Tranto1> riotkittie: this is an option, but I have a little problem with my disk... too many partitions, I can't create more
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> lol
[21:48] <slipttees> bought a Intel iMac, which version of ubuntu working on it?
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> delete some partitions
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> any
[21:48] <Lejzi> zerotime: enemy territory is for linux too
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> i would suggest 7.04
[21:48] <riotkittie> Tranto1: what did you do, go with primary partitions all the way? :o
[21:48] <MasterShrek> Tranto1, riotkittie makes a good point, install gutsy alongside and then u can copy configurations and stuff over until you are happy with it, then get rid of feisty later
[21:48] <pieisgood4589> 7.10 is still buggy
[21:49] <corpcomp> Has anyone here had anything to do with iSCSI, I am trying to find out about it and to get a working implimentation.
[21:49] <headphase> I am using gusty btw
[21:49] <DUUUUUDE> i use xubuntu
[21:49] <vocx> Tranto1, there is always the possibility of a Virtual Machine. How many partitions?
[21:49] <Tominator> hi!
[21:49] <Colro> Is there a way to reset my compiz advanced settings back to default? i messed something up and all of my animations are EXTREMELY slow now........
[21:49] <MasterShrek> nvm Tranto1 lol, i u cant make any more partitions...
[21:49] <bulio> how can I have an OSX-style application launcher in gutsy?
[21:49] <riotkittie> pieisgood4589: some people will tell you that 7.04 is still buggy, or 6.10, or 6.06
[21:49] <kevin1> hello im trying to add a partition to my fstab. I want to know if this entry will work properly; /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 01
[21:49] <Zambezi> If I want to encrypt my harddrives and don't want to use LUKS, what is there instead which is secure and stable?

[21:49] <bulio> I've seen screenshots of it and was wondering how I can install it
[21:49] <Korg> iisnt there a light version for lod crappy machines?
[21:49] <MasterShrek> =P
[21:49] <Pici> Colro: you can click the little sweep icon next to your animation settings to turn them back to default.
[21:49] <riotkittie> if you're finding bugs in 7.10, do everyone a favour and report them.
[21:49] <scottfro> whats the difference between ImPS/2 and ExplorerPS/2 when i reconfigure my xorg?
[21:49] <sadjsanjsad> hi can anyone tell me why i can't change the permissions for my windows partition even though when i am the root?
[21:49] <slipttees> please
[21:49] <MasterShrek> Korg, xubuntu, or even fluxbuntu
[21:49] <bulio> anyone?
[21:49] <erUSUL> !xubuntu
[21:49] <jnc> Tranto1: there's nothing too special about a linux setup. Files with permissions on ext3 filesystem, sockets, device nodes. Then you want to have some way to chroot into that after restoring the data and run grub to install it to the MBR
[21:49] <ubotu> xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop". | For support, see #xubuntu | See also: !ubuntu and !xubuntu-channels
[21:50] <Tranto1> vocx: In fact, I'm already using VirtualBox to use my developing tools in Windows. But the kind of things I want to test in Gutsy need to be done in a real machine
[21:50] <Colro> Pici: I don't know what setting I messed up, though.
[21:50] <tony> Can any give some more advice with this? I keep getting Error 22 when menu.lst is updated.

[21:50] <bulio> how can I have an OSX-style application launcher in gutsy?
[21:50] <jnc> Tranto1: really though, borrow somebody's hard disk and install to that, if you are doing this for work
[21:50] <bulio> I've seen screenshots of it and was wondering how I can install it
[21:50] <Pici> Colro: ask in #compiz-fusion :)
[21:50] <kevin1> thanks LiMaO :)
[21:50] <riotkittie> window manager. ie: fluxbox.

[21:50] <Korg> kk.. got it
[21:50] <pieisgood4589> how do i PM someone in xchat?
[21:50] <neopsyche> in other words... If HTTP docs is hosted on by default the install dir on first drive.. how do i chage it to be another drive.. for website.?
[21:51] <Ashex> neopsyche, yup. Mount the partitions to folders

[21:51] <leobru> Gutsy does not allow me to set screen resolution higher than 800x600 - I was happily using 1400x1050 in Fedora!
[21:51] <pieisgood4589> thanks
[21:51] <oxeimo2> does anyone know what the difference is between xorg-xserver-video-ati and xorg-xserver-video-radeonhd?
[21:51] <neopsyche> huh?
[21:51] <neopsyche> mount to folderS?
[21:51] <Fryguy--> neopsyche: edit the apache configuration to point to a different location
[21:51] <neopsyche> oh...
[21:51] <neopsyche> ok
[21:51] <Iceflame22> evening. um. i've been experienced random freezes (machine stops responding) all day. there hasn't been any time or app pattern to it, although sometimes there's been an error notification from knotify, whatever that is. are there any threads or guides for random freeze-ups?
[21:51] <akorn> leobru: what's your video card?
[21:51] <riotkittie> akorn: you need to compile compiz. from GIT.
[21:51] <Ashex> neopsyche, so add them into /etc/fstab, you can copy the one for root when making the others
[21:51] <neopsyche> So first HD will run apache..
[21:51] <jack> Does anyone know how to get a Wacom tablet working with dual monitors?
[21:51] <akorn> riotkittie: how do you do that? haha
[21:51] <jnc> Tranto1: if you can figure out how to boot a SysRescCD and talk to me via IRC using irssi client on it, then I won't mind to walk you through the process in privmsg
[21:51] <kevin1> hello im trying to add a partition to my fstab. I want to know if this entry will work properly; /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 01
[21:51] <brobostigon> hi, can mplayer play a .ram file. i have install w32codecs, but no luck, any ideas.
[21:51] <Ashex> neopsyche, mount /dev/sda1 /disk/folder
[21:51] <neopsyche> hmm
[21:51] <neopsyche> thanks
[21:51] <akorn> riotkittie: i know it was just a simple option in Beryl
[21:51] <neopsyche> wanted to know if possible
[21:51] <neopsyche> im just going to install it now
[21:52] <Fryguy--> akorn: install compizconfig-settings-manager and turn on the cube
[21:52] <tony> brobostigon: Go to the Realplayer site and download their linux player. It works great.
[21:52] <riotkittie> akorn: i've never messed with GIT so i can't tell you. there's probably a HOWTO on the forums, if not something in the compiz-fusion wiki itself.
[21:52] <akorn> Fryguy: i already did that...what i want is the windows to look separated from each other when i spin the cube, and i can' tfind that option anywhere (but found it easily in beryl)
[21:52] <Colro> Pici: No one there is sure either, I even reset my profile and it's -STILL- doing it
[21:52] <pieisgood4589> lol
[21:52] <brobostigon> i have no sound using real pl ayer
[21:52] <Odd-rationale> BTW Why isn't ccsm installed by default?
[21:52] <pieisgood4589> who here still uses win"bloze"?
[21:52] <akorn> riotkittie: thanks
[21:52] <brobostigon> nope
[21:53] <tony> brobostigon: Well, that I can't help you with. Sorry!
[21:53] <Tranto1> jnc: thanks, I can't do this right now, but I have copy/pasted your previous message :)
[21:53] <bulio> how can I have an OSX-style application launcher in gutsy?
[21:53] <bulio> I've seen screenshots of it and was wondering how I can install it
[21:53] <Fryguy--> akorn: being awfully picky for what is essentially a pure eyecandy effect, heh.  Play around with the configs some more. My cube does pretty much exactly what that picture does
[21:53] <kevin1> bulio get g-desklets
[21:53] <Odd-rationale> bulio: Do you mean AWN?
[21:53] <ba5e> why are the x234 codecs so bad? I get choppy video on my core2 duo and slight tearing in 710
[21:53] <arooni> hey folks... i just upgraded to 7.10; when i log in it warns me of low graphics mode; then i just see two cursors
[21:53] <akorn> Fryguy: haha yea mine does too except for the 3D part...i love the eyecandy because i show it off to Mac/Vista users (my friends) and rub it in their faces ;)
[21:54] <arooni> , nothing else happens
[21:54] <brobostigon> any more ideas from anyone??
[21:54] <arooni> ieas?
[21:54] <Fryguy--> akorn: ah, I use my computer to get work done.
[21:54] <Fryguy--> akorn: :)
[21:54] <stemount> thing is though akorn, most of them things are ripped from Vista  / mac :P
=== p is now known as Peste
[21:54] <ba5e> or 264 I mean
[21:54] <Fryguy--> akorn: only reason I have compiz running is for expose
[21:54] <bulio> Odd-rationale: I'm not sure, it looks like the application launcher from osx
[21:54] <akorn> Fryguy: hahaha yea, me too, sometimes....as if i do any work for my classes anyways...haha
[21:54] <kevin1> arooni, sounds like its not recognizing your graphics card
[21:54] <flick> if anyone here has used vnc, how can i prevent Alt+Tab handling on the client and instead send it to the remote server?
[21:54] <Odd-rationale> bulio: Let me get the link. I'm using it in gusty right now.
[21:54] <trippin445> i gotta question maybe one of you all could help me but i am running wine 9.33 and steam seems to crash after alil of downloading hl2 ? any one know might cause this?
[21:54] <kevin1> arooni, make sure you have the proper drivers loaded fo it
[21:54] <Sp4rKy> hi
[21:55] <kevin1> hello im trying to add a partition to my fstab. I want to know if this entry will work properly; /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 01
[21:55] <marcus_> Hello. Was wondering how to activate desktop effects in ubuntu 7.10?
[21:55] <Peste> anyone knows a way to use once a video card with VGA and DVI outputs to configure multiheads?
[21:55] <flick> right now Alt+Tab switches the VNC window instead of server handling it
[21:55] <akorn> stemount: i can see some things being ripped from MAC but i dont think vista had any original eye candy, did they? except maybe Flip 3D
[21:55] <bulio> Odd-rationale: thanks
[21:55] <arooni> kevin1, i have an nvidia graphics card ..........  i ned to manually install nvidia drivers right
[21:55] <kevin1> Peste, are you using a nvidia card
[21:55] <jnc> flick: remap Alt+Tab to something else on the local machine
[21:55] <stemount> hmm there is the screenshot at the bottom thing I guess though :/
[21:55] <stemount> thats it.. most of the rest is mac :P
[21:55] <kevin1> arooni, no use the restricted drivers
[21:55] <Peste> kevin1, yes! I am! nvidia 7200
[21:55] <akorn> Fryguy: yea i love expose
[21:55] <jnc> flick: System|Prefs|Keyboard Shortcuts
[21:55] <Tranto1> jnc: and this is not for work... in fact, my job encourages me to use Windows, but I really want to use Ubuntu with VirtualBox (as I need to use Visual Studio)
[21:55] <arooni> kevin1, really?
[21:55] <akorn> Fryguy: nice mac ripoff hehe
[21:55] <stemount> :(
[21:55] <jnc> Tranto1: ah.  Well good luck
[21:56] <Sp4rKy> i know it's not the good chan for this question which is out of topic, but i'm looking for an algorithm of a Multi writer multi reader register implementation, so if someone knows that :)
[21:56] <kevin1> Peste at aterminal type gksudo nvidia-settings
[21:56] <kevin1> arooni, yes im positive
[21:56] <Pinchiukas> what's the fastest network-mountable filesystem?
[21:56] <Pici> Sp4rKy: try ##programming :)
[21:56] <Peste> kevin1, ready...
[21:56] <arooni> kevin1, why do you say that?  i have already used nvidia's binary drivers before
[21:56] <Odd-rationale> bulio: Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/awn
[21:56] <Odd-rationale> Wiki: http://wiki.awn-project.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
[21:56] <kevin1> arooni, if you have already installed the real nvidia drivers uninstall them then enable the restricted drivers
[21:57] <leobru> akorn: my video card is permedia 3dlabs, monitor ranges are 30-96 horizontal, 50-160 vertical
[21:57] <jnc> Pinchiukas: NFS, sometimes.
[21:57] <Sp4rKy> Pici: thx
[21:57] <akorn> leobru: i'll see what i can find out
[21:57] <Pinchiukas> jnc sometimes?
[21:57] <crossout> MasterShrek, I solved the problem :D. it turns out while I was scrambling trying to figure out how to fix the boot, I loaded the optimize settings in the BIOS, needless to say that screwd things up :). Again thank you very much :).
[21:57] <arooni> kevin1, no i havent installed them yet; i was planning on it, because thats what i did in past versions of ubuntu.  what changed in 7.10?
[21:57] <Colro_> I can't switch between desktops for some reason, can anyone help? ;x
[21:57] <Tranto1> another question (sorry, I have a lot). Does anyone know why Linux doesn't stop my external hard disk drive when I execute 'umount' command? It doesn't stop spinning until I power off the machine
[21:57] <jnc> Pinchiukas: AFS is probably the best, but it is not trivial to use and has a design more suitable to huge institutions
[21:57] <Peste> kevin1, what I do now?
[21:58] <dansku> how do I install listen in ubuntu????
[21:58] <kevin1> arooni, I just know they work properly with everyhting, and thats what i was told by everyone here, ask someone why and they might be able to get more technical
[21:58] <jnc> Pinchiukas: CIFS (Samba) and NFS are on a par, while poorly configured NFS servers are often very slow
[21:58] <arooni> is there any way to make fonts look sexier in 7.10?  something like cleartype or such
[21:58] <kevin1> Peste did it bring up a settings window for nvidia?
[21:58] <jnc> poorly configured CIFS setups are just a bad idea
[21:58] <Clinton__> which services are modifying my CPU speed?  I've removed powernowd, disabled the service in System->Administration->Services, and yet something is *still* forcing my CPU to run at "power-saving" speeds.  My CPU needs to run at 100% speed all the time.
[21:59] <boubbin> i am playing aroundwith grub and its gfxmenu etc kind of things, is it possible to testrun the grub with this new configuration, or do i just have to boot ?
[21:59] <jnc> Pinchiukas: if you need unix permissions, use NFS
[21:59] <stemount> Clinton__, is it an AMD processor?
[21:59] <Clinton__> stemount: yes
[21:59] <arooni> how do i get sound working in gutsy?  i have a sound blaster live card that worked great in feisty?
[21:59] <Peste> kevin1, yes! It's on my front!
[21:59] <Tranto1> arooni: I achived this in Feisty, I think in Gutsy it is possible too. There's an option that enable some sort of 'Clear Type' in Ubuntu fonts
[21:59] <Fryguy--> Clinton__: sure you don't have something turned on in bios?
[21:59] <stemount> Clinton__, isn't it enabled at bios?
[21:59] <Pinchiukas> jnc samba also has permissions
[21:59] <jnc> Pinchiukas: uh, "read, write, system"
[21:59] <dansku> could any one help me how can i install listen in gnome ubuntu?
[21:59] <shane_> I need some help with a laptop install,...I keep getting hung on the partioning part of the install.  Is there a way to change the file system from the ubuntu desktop?
=== Shinto is now known as CHC
[22:00] <kevin1> Peste, now enable the second monitor, select its position in relation to your existing monitor
[22:00] <Vlet> arooni: the cleartype option in in the appearance control panel
[22:00] <Pici> dansku: sudo apt-get install listen
[22:00] <Fryguy--> dansku: sudo apt-get install listen
[22:00] <jnc> Pinchiukas: you'd lose pipes, device nodes, read/write/execute/sticky/uid
[22:00] <Peste> kevin1, humm
[22:00] <arooni> Vlet, yup better.  any idea on how to get sound working?
[22:00] <jim__> Hi all, looking for some help - I reinstalled 7.04 - got all my DVD players etc up and running, but after a reboot the system does not recognise my cds or dvds? All help is greatly appreciated ;)
[22:00] <albertmk> How can I configure my Ubuntu to show only specifics windows on the panel, instead of showing all of them?
[22:00] <seth> Gnomad2 keeps closing when i try to transfer files to my harddrive!
[22:00] <dansku> tk
[22:00] <akorn> leobru: backup your xorg and then download, through Synaptic Package Manager, the xserver-xorg-video-glint package (you can simply just serach Permedia and it'll come up) and try using that...it should have drivers for your video card
[22:00] <Pinchiukas> jnc you mean if I mount another computers /dev directory, I can take full advantage of the hardware it has?
[22:00] <jnc> Pinchiukas: no
[22:01] <seth> is anyone familiar with that program?
[22:01] <albertmk> because, I want to know which are the windows that are beeing used in this workspace
[22:01] <jnc> Pinchiukas: but if you were doing backups or software development... etc.
[22:01] <albertmk> How can I configure my Ubuntu to show only specifics windows on the panel, instead of showing all of them? Because, I want to know which are the windows that are beeing used in this workspace.
[22:01] <Pinchiukas> I don't do those :)
[22:01] <kevin1> Peste its pretty self explanitory, click on X server Display configuration from the list
[22:01] <Fryguy--> albertmk: right click on the window list panel, preferences the option is right there "window list content"
[22:01] <jnc> Pinchiukas: NFS is machine level authentication, Samba is user level authentication
[22:01] <HPM> When I open Azureus I see the main window for 1 second and then it closes. (JRE 1.5.0_13) Any ideas?
[22:02] <kevin1> peste if you have two monitors hooked up you should see two boxes
[22:02] <Clinton__> my BIOS has power saving disabled
[22:02] <leobru> akorn: thanks!

[22:02] <kevin1> Peste you could click detect displays

[22:02] <oxeimo2> how do I find out which driver I'm using?
[22:03] <arooni> Vlet, pluggin in my speakers helped a lot
[22:03] <oxeimo2> how do I find out which video driver I'm using for my ati card?
[22:03] <Pinchiukas> jnc what is machine-level authentication?
[22:03] <akorn> leobru: you're welcome :) hopefully that solves it
[22:03] <Colro_> I can't switch between desktops for some reason, can anyone help? :/
[22:03] <jnc> Pinchiukas: only a.b.c.d gets to mount
[22:03] <kevin1> Peste, then you have to choose which mode you want, seperate x screen or xview
[22:03] <jnc> Pinchiukas: all other hosts are denied
[22:03] <juanbond> Is VMWare Server available for gutsy in the repository yet?  If not, does anyone know when, or how I can install vmware server right now.
[22:03] <Clinton__> Ubuntu Gutsy AMD64 has been doing extremely poorly, on Feisty everything worked great.  No random lockups for two minutes (like what just happened), no videos scrambling 90 seconds into play, no intermittent reduction of CPU usage just to save power when I need my CPU at 100% availability at all times.  What the hell happened in this new release?  Things were working so greatly before.  And yes, I did a clean install for those who will
[22:03] <pietshah> Hi room! I've installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and now I would like to create another partition for installing windows also. Could someone help me with a reference how to proceed?
[22:03] <akorn> after you install, go to System, Preferences, and Screen Resolution
[22:03] <Pinchiukas> jnc you mean authentication is done per-ip?
[22:03] <arooni__> when trying to install the restricted nvidia driver, i got: E: /var/cache/apt/archives/nvidia-glx-new_100.14.19+2.6.22.4-14.9_i386.deb: trying to overwrite `/usr/bin/nvidia-xconfig', which is also in package nvidia-xconfig
[22:03] <arooni__>  ... any ideas on what to do next?
[22:03] <jnc> Pinchiukas: per host
[22:03] <amigamax> Colro: you can go to compiz settings click on preferences and click reset to defaults.

[22:04] <Tranto1> juanbond: I think the only that matters here is the kernel version. I have updated Feisty to 6.2.22 and VMWare server works, after recompiling some modules.

[22:04] <id> Hi! I need help. My 2 windows partitions are locked in Gutsy. Others are working fine
[22:04] <Altk> I've been working on this a bit, and when I boot up, i no longer get a spinning cursor before the login, but i get an error "There was an error loading the theme Human", and I can click OK, but the same dialogue just comes back
[22:04] <flick> if anyone used vnc for remote desktop from windows, is there any way to ask it to send over the Alt+Tab instead of letting Windows handling it?
[22:04] <pietshah> Hi room! I've installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and now I would like to create another partition for installing windows also. Could someone help me with a reference how to proceed?
[22:04] <juanbond> So, it's not an easy solution for right now?
[22:04] <jnc> I gotta leave, this is horribly busy.
[22:04] <kevin1> peste im sorry but i have to go for now, ill be back in a while, im sure someone can help you here if you still cant figure it out
[22:05] <wirechief1> jnc this is normal
[22:05] <heraclitus> pietshah, splitting a partition is extremely dangerous, better don't do that... i think the easiest solution, buy another hard disk, and install windows there...
[22:05] <riotkittie> pietshah: you really should install windows first, then ubuntu for the sake of cutting down on headaches
[22:05] <headphase> I tried to install a webcam and now my tv tune rcard is no longer recognized
[22:05] <oxeimo2> wirechief1: It says: "Section "Divice" ..."Driver    "vesa"""
[22:05] <Peste> kevin1, ok! thank you!
[22:05] <Tranto1> juanbond: yes, download VMServer (latest version) and it will install correctly... Maybe it will have to compile some modules, but it's transparent tou you
[22:05] <erik78se> Can someone tell me how to disable error-messages on STDOUT? It keeps spamming on my terminal
[22:05] <jim__> jnc: Did you mention that you may be able to help with a dvd/cd issue earlier?
[22:05] <jnc> wirechief1: heh, yeah I know.  it's just bad for me, I dropped in to ask if there was someone with experience with Xen + Gutsy, and I end up helping random people
[22:05] <Peste> I'm trying to turn on the second monitor.. it just don't work
[22:05] <threeseas> Before I do a fresh install, I'd like to backup my home directory to dvd.... but so much has been disabled in the failed install I don't know how to do it
[22:05] <wirechief1> oxeimo2: your using vesa
[22:05] <Peste> :(
[22:05] <Vlet> woot - compizfusion 0.6 released :)
[22:05] <oxeimo2> wirechief1: how do I change the driver that it's using? I just downloaded the xorg-xserver-video-radeonhd" package
[22:06] <juanbond> Tranto1: just download it from vmware's site?
[22:06] <wirechief1> jnc i helped at least twenty last night

[22:06] <dudesmn> how do i fix the boot selector after removing ubuntu
[22:06] <wirechief1> jnc kinda like fishing hauling one in at a time
[22:06] <albertmk> Fryguy: where's the window list panel?
[22:06] <pietshah> heraclitus: Hmm since it's a laptop another disk would mean external... not optimal. Consider that I dont mind erasing my Ubuntu installation if I did it wrong (since I've just done it). Can't I split my hard disk in 2 so I can run Ubuntu and Windows?
[22:06] <scottfro> and it wont autodect it at all
[22:06] <wirechief1> jnc lol it was fun better than sidux
[22:06] <Tranto1> juanbond:  yes, Server version is free. I did it this way... download from VMWare site and execute the install.pl script

[22:08] <Clinton__> My Linux experience is vast, I'm quite experienced in Debian releases.  However, I cannot figure out what the hell is going on here.  Someone tell me in the next two minutes what the hell is modifying my CPU speeds.  It is *NOT* bios, it is *NOT* powernowd.  Cpufreq is *not* installed.  It is *something else*.  What is it?  Failure to inform of what is modyfing my CPU speeds will not only see Ubuntu removed from this computer, but will
[22:08] <wirechief1> jim__: hehe well we probably have to do some bailing first a lot of water here today

[22:09] <cornucopia> How to get AppArmor running with a custom kernel such as 2.6.23 since in gutsy the apparmor-modules-source are no more?
[22:09] <riotkittie> pietshah: for simplicity's sake [if you've got time to kill and your current ubuntu install contains nothing of value] I'd pop the windows install CD in, let it remove the ubuntu partition, specify X amount of space for Windows while installing and leave whatever amount of space you want for ubuntu unallocated [or create another partition, which can be transformed] ... but... hold on a sec
[22:09] <MasterShrek> Clinton__, ubuntu i believe throttles your cpu when its not being used
[22:09] <shane_> Hello. Could someone please help me. I am on my 3rd version of ubuntu and I can't get my laptop past the file system setup/parition.
[22:09] <Clinton__> Tranto1: thank you for offering to help.  It is a desktop.
[22:09] <PriceChild> cornucopia, we don't support custom kernels here.
[22:09] <DjViper> cliebow: first of all, we don't care if you uninstall ubuntu, help is a priviledge, not a right, before flaming us here did you try to google?

[22:10] <riotkittie> pietshah: you can also fire up gparted from a live CD and use it to resize your ubuntu partition and create free space to install windows to. BUT windows can be cranky if its not installed to the beginning of the drive. ymmv
[22:10] <jim__> id: Have you tried installing ntfs-3g
[22:10] <smax> /boot/grub/menu.lst
[22:10] <Vlet> youknowme: well, look at the line in your menu.lst that you're trying to load, and check what disk it is claiming it is on
[22:10] <cornucopia> PriceChild, sure, is thetre a dev channel?
[22:10] <Fryguy--> jim__: ntfs-3g is enabled by default
[22:10] <wirechief1> oxeimo2: hmmm i have you clicked on but no message
[22:10] <jim__> id: You could also instal smbfs
[22:11] <riotkittie> pietshah: and if you install windows 2nd, you will need to fix the ubuntu bootloader because windows cant boot linux
[22:11] <Colro_> Odd-rationale: It just uh, doesn't work. I have it set to four desktops and it's showing two. I try to switch and I still see my windows from the other desktop in the gnome panel and sometimes my desktop icons disappear
[22:11] <MasterShrek> well Clinton__ if it bothers you that much, compile a new kernel without support for changing cpu frequencies
[22:11] <PriceChild> cornucopia, for development of ubuntu, not support.
[22:11] <Clinton__> Fryguy--: I have on demand services that normally complete in about 100ms.  With this damn throttling they are taking 3200ms
[22:11] <PriceChild> cornucopia, why are you using a custom kernel?
[22:11] <heraclitus> pietshah, you can if you are absolutely sure that losing your data would do you no harm...
[22:11] <wirechief1> oxeimo2: check for a box on bottom of the screen
[22:11] <cornucopia> PriceChild, because its there
[22:11] <Clinton__> MasterShrek: that should not be necessary.  I should have the ability to disable it without recompilation.
[22:11] <PriceChild> cornucopia, because its there?
[22:11] <Odd-rationale> Colro_: You have compiz-config-settings-manager installed. Correct?
[22:11] <oxeimo2> wirechief1: hmm, do you have aim?
[22:11] <wirechief1> oxeimo2: just clik on my nick
[22:11] <Tranto1> Clinton__: I have a laptop and my problem was that, with 6.2.20 kernel, it was always running at the maximum speed, so 'On demand' mode was not working. It was a bug, and in 6.2.22 it was solved. it was related with some specific models of laptops, including my sony vaio. But you use a desktop... don't know if this has something to do with your problem
[22:11] <id> jim_: I've installed NTFS-3g
[22:11] <Vlet> cornucopia: it's not there. you put it there.
[22:11] <riotkittie> brb.
[22:11] <Colro_> Odd-rationale: Correct, resetting its profile is what created this problem.

[22:25] <eodchop> fastn:not unblocked. Just blackilsted.
[22:25] <billy> hi to all i am new here
[22:25] <PriceChild> slylock, from where?
[22:25] <cpt> Tranto1, could you send me your xorg.conf please?
[22:25] <Vlet> Fryguy--: well, you're probably intuitive by nature :)
[22:25] <slylock> from a remote
[22:26] <PriceChild> billy, most are, no need to mention it :)
[22:26] <slylock> machine which is ubuntu
[22:26] <cpt> Tranto1, I messed it up myself you see
[22:26] <slylock> and my local machine is windows
[22:26] <asbani> MaxRandor: people might shout at me telling you this, but I'd recommend a fresh gutsy install, download gutsy.iso and do a fresh install :)
[22:26] <Fryguy--> Vlet: I dunno, seems obvious to me
[22:26] <RoC_MasterMind> slylock, there are many ways
[22:26] <slylock> i am connected via ssh to that machine
[22:26] <Fastn> eodchop: well its deny me to use visual effects, have you a clue when its removed from blacklist
[22:26] <cpt> PriceChild, nothing is working after i tryed changing the standard driver setings :)
[22:26] <billy> has any one had experience running wine with veoh
[22:26] <PriceChild> slylock, samba is one way... /msg ubotu samba
[22:26] <slylock> so is there any command that can help me get hte files
[22:26] <aleka> Is there a package gnome-dock in the repos? if not where can I get the source?
[22:26] <Fezzler> Fryguy: With 7.10, I don't have to use Samba to share files across Windows network anymore, right?
[22:26] <PriceChild> cpt, so you broke it... and complain it doesn't work out of the box
[22:26] <Fryguy--> Vlet: 10s of thousands of google results for ubuntu <insert any 4 words related to a problem here> helps out too
[22:26] <MasterShrek> !samba | slylock
[22:26] <ubotu> slylock: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[22:26] <PriceChild> !xconfig | cpt (second command)
[22:26] <ubotu> cpt (second command): To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type « sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg » - To configure only the driver and resolution, type « sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh » - See also !FixRes
[22:26] <eodchop> fastn: i read it recently. Let me see if i can find the link
[22:26] <james296> ok, what the heck happened to doc.gwos.org? it looks like its no longer any kind of documentation site...
[22:27] <Tranto1> cpt: In fact I don't know where that file is in! :) When I installed Feisty, it configured with the correct resolution without doing anything else
[22:27] <Fezzler> Fryguy: But I need Samba for networking with my G5 iMac, right?
[22:27] <juanbond> in ubuntu, where's the directory that contains the init directories?
[22:27] <Fastn> eodchop: yeah thx ;)
[22:27] <billy> i would like to get veoh running i get it to install but i cannot find the app files to run it
[22:27] <Fryguy--> Fezzler: you don't have to use samba, but you have to use SOMETHING (nfs, cifs, shfs(
[22:27] <arooni> i cant get any output now.........  when i try to start up i get no output :9
[22:27] <savvas> which package includes the whois command? I get "fgets: Connection reset by peer" when I try to whois an IP
[22:27] <cpt> Tranto1, ok
[22:27] <MaxRandor>  DShepherd seems to be doing something
[22:27] <PriceChild> james296, database lost several times after attacks. Further discussion in #ubuntuforums
[22:27] <DShepherd> MaxRandor, hmm ok.
[22:27] <slylock> cant i use ssh
[22:27] <DShepherd> MaxRandor, cheer it on
[22:27] <fairway> will the ubuntu install let me resize an nfts partition to make place for ubuntu?
[22:27] <Joikast> how do I enable the extra repositories in synaptic package manager??
[22:27] <james296> so did they give up or something?
[22:28] <Fryguy--> fairway: yes

[22:28] <ubotu> maxkelley: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[22:28] <Fryguy--> Joikast: it's in one of the menus
[22:28] <MasterShrek> oops
[22:28] <Fryguy--> Fezzler: no, neither it nor samba are built in.  and you want to use samba
[22:28] <DShepherd> MasterShrek, hehe
[22:28] <Fryguy--> Fezzler: nfs is a poor choice for desktop use imo, samba is much better supported for the typical user in typical circumstances
[22:28] <eodchop> fastn: go here www.compiz.com/users/faq
[22:28] <MSTK> can anyone help me get my desktop back up and running?  I think I might haev accidentally deleted a startup process or something, because nautilus doesn't launch and all that is on my desktop is the wallpaper
[22:29] <MaxRandor> :-(
[22:29] <Fastn> eodchop: Thx i check :)
[22:29] <arooni> how do i do that sudo dpkg reconfigure thing?
[22:29] <MasterShrek> MSTK, create a new user and see if the problem persists
[22:29] <Fryguy--> arooni: dpkg-reconfigure <package name>
[22:29] <oxeimon> does anyone have compiz working on an open source ati driver?
[22:29] <arooni> Fryguy--, i want reconfigure the xorg thing
[22:29] <eodchop> I read it on compiz website about. That is a great place to start.
[22:29] <slackern> oxeimon, the radeonhd driver doesn't have any accelleration like that yet.
[22:29] <RoC_MasterMind> oxeimon, ATI's driver is not open-source.
[22:29] <MasterShrek> arooni, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[22:30] <Innomen> how would one go about viewing rm and mov files?
[22:30] <billy> i guess none has any exp with veoh under wine then , thanks 4 your time every one
[22:30] <Joikast> Iv'e added the ones in the third part softwares .. still does not work :(
[22:30] <toed> I don't know if this is an ubuntu (gutsy) problem or a firefox problem, but all of a sudden firefox isn't getting anything from my keyboard: keyboard shortcuts don't work, I can't type in the address bar, etc.
[22:30] <frojnd> I was trying to install feisty and gutsy but the same problem: after running local script /etec/rz.load gnome failed. Everytime also in safe mode... ( I was trying to install it with live cd) I have inspiron 6400 (0122) Anyone??
[22:30] <MasterShrek> !medibuntu | Innomen
[22:30] <oxeimon> slackern: I downloaded the xorg-xserver-video-radeonhd driver
[22:30] <ubotu> Innomen: medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
[22:30] <billy> have a nice day/night where ever you are
[22:30] <MaxRandor> how do you tell apt-get to redownload the .deb
[22:30] <erUSUL> !mp3 | Innomen
[22:30] <MSTK> MasterShrek - thanks, I'll try that.  But I"m pretty sure it might be something I did with the startup process.  I was trying to "embed" a shell onto the desktop, which involved taking out the items.  but i'm not sure how to reenable them now.  it's probably just a simple process
[22:30] <StrawberryAngel1> the proprietary radeon driver makes my video crash
[22:30] <TNDT> hey, i havent had any luck finding help on the forums. i installed gutsy on my laptop last night, and it worked fine. i installed acer_acpi and vlc, and that seemed to go fine (i doubt theyr the problem). once i restarted the machine, the screen resolution decided to go down to 640x480. in the screens/graphics manager, it says plug'n'play for the monitor type, and although i can test out other monitors and resolutions, it wont actually apply
[22:30] <ubotu> Innomen: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[22:30] <Fryguy--> Innomen: use mplayer or realplayer for realmedia files, and quicktime files will play in totem with the proper gstreamer codecs installed
[22:30] <cpt> PriceChild, Do i need to reboot after this?
[22:30] <DShepherd> MaxRandor, apt-get isntall <package>
[22:30] <PriceChild> cpt, just restart X
[22:30] <MasterShrek> MSTK, probably, but i wouldnt know where to look
[22:31] <oxeimon> slackern: will the xorg-xserver-video-ati driver work with my radeon x1950? Its pretty new
[22:31] <slackern> oxeimon, that one is quite old, there's usually a new version pushed via git every day, but there is just basic 2d support still
[22:31] <MSTK> are there any startup processes that involve nautilus?
[22:31] <slackern> oxeimon, i have a X1950Pro AGP card also and mine is working fine for normal use.
[22:31] <james296> OH whats the best area for me to go to so I can easily theme sudo apps when using 3rd party themes?
[22:31] <oxeimon> slackern: do you have compiz working?
[22:31] <PriceChild> james296, why do you need to theme sudo apps? :/
[22:32] <Fryguy--> MSTK: every user of the system has their own startup process, so just create a new user and see if that works
[22:32] <slackern> oxeimon, but it does not support anything 3dish nor any accellerated video playback or anything like that, it's still just very basic
[22:32] <nownot_> anyone here have any experinece with openvpn?
[22:32] <Joikast> Can someone please help me with my graphic card? I cant enable the "Nvidia accelerated graphics driver, it says "the software source for the package nvidia-glx-new is not enabled.. I have a geforce fx5200 card.
[22:32] <branstrom> Tracker isn't giving me any results since a week or so
[22:32] <Innomen> is there a way to install all of these packages at once?
[22:32] <Dekkard> well. it worked.. i have gutsy..
[22:32] <altf4>  dopo il login in gusty e prima del caricamento desktop mi apapre uno sfondo marroncino per uno o due secondi .. come lo elimino?
[22:32] <branstrom> Common problem?

[22:32] <james296> because I dont like it when it looks ugly when I open synaptic...
[22:32] <Fryguy--> Joikast: like we said before, open up synaptic and enable the extra repositories

[22:32] <PriceChild> Pici, check the hostmask
[22:32] <Joikast> I did
[22:32] <Pici> PriceChild: oops :p
[22:32] <kyaneos> hi
[22:32] <MSTK> fryguy - I could do that, but i figured it might be faster to just ask here if anyone had it.  it'd be a bit faster.
[22:32]  * N3bunel away
[22:32] <slackern> oxeimon, it'll probably be like 6months till they get to the 3d parts of it, could be more or less i really don't know, you could ask in #radeonhd which is the development channel for the driver
[22:32] <Fryguy--> MSTK: it will be far faster to create a new user
[22:33] <Fryguy--> MSTK: creating a new user takes like 5 seconds
[22:33] <MSTK> i'll try it, then
[22:33] <Fryguy--> Joikast: so if you did that, then install the driver
[22:33] <oxeimon> slackern: so there are no open source ati drivers that will work with compiz?
[22:33] <cherva> what is Anacron job 'cron.daily' ?
[22:33] <cherva> !anacron
[22:33] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about anacron - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[22:33] <Fryguy--> oxeimon: not with your card, no
[22:33] <bulio> gnome-look.org seems to be down
[22:33] <PriceChild> !offtopic > bulio
[22:33] <slackern> oxeimon, no not yet, not for our r5xx cards atleast
[22:33] <bulio> is there any where else I can get themes for Ubuntu?
[22:34] <PhilAirtime> bulio: anywhere else as opposed to where?
[22:34] <DShepherd> bulio, gnome-looks.org
[22:34] <oxeimon> slackern: Has anyone gotten dual head AND compiz to work with the proprietary driver?
[22:34] <rhalff> hi for some reason my sound stopped working, what is a good way to debug this ? when I use 'test' in the sound configuration I can here a *poof*  but no sound, so something is connecting I just don't get the proper sound.
[22:34] <Fryguy--> oxeimon: not with your card, no
[22:34] <arooni> where can i get a changelist of what gutsy has over feisty?
[22:34] <Joikast> Fryguy: I still cant enable it
[22:34] <DShepherd> bulio, http://art.gnome.org/ maybe?
[22:34] <slackern> oxeimon, hmm i've seen them talking about it or if it was in the mailing list, but im not sure, sorry
[22:34] <bulio> PhilAirtime: as opposed to gnome-look.org
[22:34] <Innomen> can someone suggest a way to download all of http://packages.medibuntu.org/pool/ ?
[22:34] <bulio> DShepherd: I only found wallpapers there
[22:34] <Fryguy--> Joikast: then you horribly broke your setup
[22:34] <stemount> Innomen,
[22:34] <Innomen> i have no idea what i need but i have plenty of space
[22:35] <stemount> wget -R http://URL
[22:35] <MSTK> fryguy-- i've made a new user, but how can I check the startup processes without logging out?
[22:35] <DShepherd> bulio, hmm,, deviant art then?
[22:35] <ompaul> bulio, wait a while for the other thing to return
[22:35] <Pici> arooni: Check the release notes / features on ubuntu.com
[22:35] <Joikast> hmm
[22:35] <Joikast> wierd
[22:35] <arooni> how can i get my dual montiors working in gutsy?  i have an nvidia grphaics card and its not working :(
[22:35] <Fryguy--> MSTK: you can't really
[22:35] <Joikast> I had the same problem with my ATI card
[22:35] <Fryguy--> just log out for a second
[22:35] <james296> so yeah where can I go to find out how to theme synaptic w/ 3rd party themes?
[22:35] <oxeimon> okay, so what about dual head without compiz
[22:35] <DShepherd> bulio, http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2/ did you check here.. there's some links on the right
[22:35] <MSTK> fryguy - is there a "quick" log out and session resume?
[22:36] <MSTK> ah, wait
[22:36] <IndyGunFreak> oxeimon: dual head will work with compiz.. it does for me anyways, i just don't mess withi t much
[22:36] <MSTK> i see it
[22:36] <Fryguy--> MSTK: there is, but i wouldn't recommend using it while testing to make sure this works right
[22:36] <oxeimon> IndyGunFreak: what driver are you using/card
[22:36] <MSTK> i just want to see what the startup process are with a blank user
[22:36] <muzzlol> Need some help with chmod

[22:37] <Fryguy--> TNDT: ask the question you really want to ask
[22:37] <muzzlol> i tryed chmod 777
[22:37] <TNDT> hey, i havent had any luck finding help on the forums. i installed gutsy on my laptop last night, and it worked fine. i installed acer_acpi and vlc, and that seemed to go fine (i doubt theyr the problem). once i restarted the machine, the screen resolution decided to go down to 640x480. in the screens/graphics manager, it says plug'n'play for the monitor type, and although i can test out other monitors and resolutions, it wont actually apply

[22:37] <RoC_MasterMind> muzzlol, chmod o+rw /directory
[22:37] <stemount> Innomen, come to #discuss-ubuntu :)
[22:37] <IndyGunFreak> oxeimon: thats your prob, ATI.
[22:37] <Fryguy--> oxeimon: I'm going to say this one more time.  You can't use compiz with your graphics card.
[22:37] <hikenboot> so how do i get rid of the problem it appears not to deboostrap everything i need
[22:37] <slackern> oxeimon, that one doesn't support the r5xx/r6xx gpu's as far as i know, only the older cards
[22:37] <ec158148> hello all, i dont seem to have the manpage for scanf
[22:38] <ec158148> could somebody guess as to why?

[22:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about portforwarding - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[22:57] <MasterShrek> Innomen, you just have to install the codecs, and the players should pick them up
[22:57] <arang2> guys anyone could tell me the proper way to install opera 9.24 in ubuntu gutsy (Gnome?) cos i've seen many ways online and some lead to problems

[22:58] <rokia> can anyone help me with a Xubuntu problem? its going to be a hard one.
[22:58] <riotkittie> rokia: ask it, and find out ;P
[22:58] <MasterShrek> hozano, i dont know for sure then, its really easy with nvidia because the nvidia driver installs a nice config program
[22:58] <cpt> Powerix, ?
[22:59] <bubu> what if it is aproblem with adept
[22:59] <Powerix> cpt: I don't see it.
[22:59] <gabbarinho> is there a list of common reasons that makes ubuntu hang during boot-up?
[22:59] <cpt> Powerix, the message ?
[22:59] <Powerix> cpt: does it say you have direct rendering
[22:59] <arang2> kkathman: dling from the page leads to an antialiased opera, and using the qt-shared works only (as far as i know?) with Kubuntu , thats why i ask
[22:59] <cpt> Powerix, yes
[23:00] <Powerix> cpt: cool :) Thats one thing then
[23:00] <Vlet> !u | cpt
[23:00] <hozano> MasterShrek: Ok. :( I will try again asking in the channel... Thanks

[23:00] <rokia> well, I fresh installed 7.10 on my laptop and its running horrifically slow, but in waves,  going back and fourth between normal speeds and snail pace
[23:00] <hozano> Hi. I am using Gutsy. How to configure the S-Video port to display an video in my TV (Intel i810)?
[23:00] <riotkittie> bubu: your problem with adept may very well have been caused by automatix.
[23:00] <OVM> hola, como puedo enviar un correo?
[23:00] <kkathman> arang2,  well its seemd to work ok in previous versions- I havent tried in Gutsy tho

[23:00] <faiaookami> I like Gusty so far
[23:00] <rokia> i dont even know where to start.
[23:00] <cpt> Powerix, hehe yes, but it im no further :)
[23:00] <faiaookami> But, how do I configure Compiz Fusion?
[23:00] <riotkittie> rokia: the beginning's always a good place.
[23:00] <arang2> kkathman: anyone knows?
[23:01] <riotkittie> !ccsm | faiaookami
[23:01] <ubotu> faiaookami: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[23:01] <bubu> It would be nice to fix the problem, where ever it originated
[23:01] <faiaookami> Okay
[23:01] <kkathman> arang2,  of course, you could just install via the repos - probably wont be 9.24 tho
[23:01] <faiaookami> Thanks
[23:01] <Powerix> cpt: I'd go back to the Cedega website now and check their forum... I seem to remember something on there
[23:01] <riotkittie> hmmm. and thhis is xubuntu?
[23:01] <PhilAirtime> kkathman: 9.24 is in the Feisty commercial repo
[23:01] <cpt> Powerix, ok ill try.
[23:01] <hozano> Hi. I am using Gutsy. How to configure the S-Video port to display an video in my TV (Intel i810)?
[23:01] <riotkittie> does xubuntu have any silly graphical flashiness going on in 7.10?
[23:01] <mpeters> riotkittie: i know what you're talking about
[23:01] <Powerix> faiaookami: right-click, change desktop background, visual effects
[23:01] <Vlet> riotkittie: like xorg?
[23:02] <mpeters> i could never find a fix for that issue
[23:02] <kkathman> PhilAirtime, right - I just assumed that he was asking about Gutsy
[23:02] <jmagder> Anyone have a problem with corrupted consoles? (Ctrl Alt F1/2/3/4/5/6)
[23:02] <Innomen> Package w32codecs is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source E: Package w32codecs has no installation candidate
[23:02] <pramz> hi
[23:02] <rokia> riotkittie: yes, i was running vector before this and it was fine, but xubuntu is only just running
[23:02] <faiaookami> It's already enabled
[23:02] <jmagder> In Gutsy that is.
[23:02] <faiaookami> I just configure it
[23:02] <arang2> kkathman: i cant find it thru the repos, and at the wiki it says that it should be installed from the developer cos the repos version has security issues
[23:02] <mpeters> it had something to due with apps written with gecko engine for me
[23:02] <PhilAirtime> kkathman: I've no idea; Gutsy is beyond me, I'm still on Feisty!
[23:02] <faiaookami> *want to
[23:02] <riotkittie> Vlet: er. xorg isnt flashy.  :P   i was thinking along the lines of desktop effects.

[23:03] <fpauls> i need some virtualbox help
[23:03] <Innomen> "A problem occurred while loading a library or a decoder (cook.so)." still
[23:04] <juanbond> i just created a new partition for misc data at /dev/sda3 and i am trying to mount it to /data, how can i create that mount point?
[23:04] <Vlet> fpauls: what's your question?
[23:04] <faiaookami> Where can I find "compizconfig-settings-manager"
[23:04] <scguy318> juanbond: mkdir /data
[23:04] <Vlet> faiaookami: you need to install it
[23:04] <faiaookami> I don't see it anywhere in Synaptec

One; my NTFS drives will not mount in ubuntu gutsy, it says there was an improper shutdown, and that they need to be removed, but I have done that. Also, how do I disable my on-board graphics card and enable a Radeon X 1600 PCI E, (the original card is Nvidia) Anyone that could help me out I would appreciate it
[23:04] <mpeters> try sudo apt-get install compizconfig* and see if you get lucky :)
[23:05] <mpeters> compiz-config
[23:05] <faiaookami> okay
[23:05] <juanbond> awesome!  thanks for the tips :)
[23:05] <Pici> !ccsm

[23:05] <bubu> my system is not removing lock files, which prevent me from using other file managers
[23:05] <Innomen> Powerix: E: Package w32codecs has no installation candidate any ideas?
[23:06] <Fastn> Does anyone know why Intel 965 chipset is blacklisted of compiz? any information are appricieted
[23:06] <ootm> I have LIRC installed for my remote control. What package can I use to set up my IMON remote to control applications?
[23:06] <MasterShrek> Innomen, did u add the medibuntu repositories?
[23:06] <ootm> for example, control the volume
[23:06] <Cryoniq_> Anyone know how to fix the missing title bar in Wine applications when using compiz fusion?
[23:06] <Innomen> MasterShrek: i believe so
[23:06] <ThunderStruck> fastit lacks support for texture_8
[23:06] <ThunderStruck> -8 +*
[23:06] <MasterShrek> Innomen, did u apt-get update?
[23:06] <threeseas> Its rather interesting how the so called upgrade has removed all the programs or broken them such that a recovery or even a backup of data is not possible
[23:06] <Innomen> MasterShrek: probably not
[23:07] <riotkittie> rokia: i'm clueless. for what its worth, the one time i tried xubuntu, i too found it to be unbearably slow in comparison to the xfce desktop on zenwalk :|
[23:07] <kkathman> anyone know what happened to the built-in emerald themes ?
[23:07] <kkathman> if you run emerald-theme-manager you used to get like 20 themes or so
[23:07] <Fastn> Does anyone know why Intel 965 chipset is blacklisted of compiz? any information are appricieted
[23:07] <MasterShrek> kkathman, no idea, i didnt have any either, had to install them manually
[23:07] <tlarkin244> Hello everybody, I had a couple of questions to ask...

Also, how do I disable my on-board graphics card and enable a Radeon X 1600 PCI E, (the original card is Nvidia) Anyone that could help me out I would appreciate it
[23:07] <juanbond> and in what way to i have /dev/sda3 mount to /data everytime ubuntu starts?
[23:07] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, 2 things cause that. 1 you didnt use the version of update-manager from feisty-updates or 2. you didnt use update-manager
[23:07] <Fryguy--> kkathman: they are contained in another package now
[23:07] <Innomen> MasterShrek: how would i do both of those things?
[23:07] <juanbond> init.d?
[23:08] <ChrisC35> i'm installing ubuntu (alternate install) for the 1st time, i have a new machine with 2 500gig sata's. I want to set it up with both these in RAID1. Can I set this up in the isntall? right now i'm at the point at paritioning method - guided, lvm etc.
[23:08] <threeseas> Ubuntu really doesn't need to compete with MS upgrade
[23:08] <kkathman> Fryguy--,  ahhh
[23:08] <arooni_> how do i use the new integrated desktop search?
[23:08] <MasterShrek> Innomen, sudo apt-get update     then     sudo apt-get upgrade
[23:08] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, always the chance you had unsupported packages
[23:08] <riotkittie> threeseas: that usually results from having installed something wonky on the upgrader's part [unsupported software, automatix, so on so forth]
[23:08] <kkathman> Fryguy--,  do you happen to know the name?
[23:08] <fpauls> can anyone help me install guest additions in vbox?
[23:08] <mpeters> arooni:
[23:08] <mpeters> alt f3
[23:08] <MasterShrek> Innomen, actually not the second one, use this instead: sudo apt-get install w32codecs
[23:08] <Bupuntu> hi all
[23:08] <Fryguy--> kkathman: unfortunately not, I was looking it up for you but I can't find it right now, try google
[23:08] <kkathman> ok thx
[23:09] <Fryguy--> kkathman: I use gtk-window-decorator so :/
[23:09] <Bupuntu> if i would change the home icon on the desktop, which name i should look for?
[23:09] <TNDT> (riotkittie): thanks, it seems to have fixed the screen resolution problem. just one sidenote and its not a big deal. when i type in the user/pass at the login screen, the characters are about half the size of the screen. just a wierd side effect i guess
[23:09] <Innomen> MasterShrek: Package w32codecs is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source E: Package w32codecs has no installation candidate
[23:09] <riotkittie> TNDT: i'm having that issue on one of my gutsy installs. i cant figure out why :|
[23:09] <threeseas> Guess this failed upgrade means I go out and buy a nother hard drive so to be able to save my data
[23:09] <TNDT> heh
[23:09] <MasterShrek> Innomen, pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[23:10] <murkyMurk> can a different wallpaper be set on each desktop in gnome yet?
[23:10] <threeseas> Which HD company does Ubuntu have stock in?
[23:10] <Cpudan80> seagate I think
[23:10] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:10] <Fryguy--> threeseas: why not just restore the backup you made before you made major changes to your operating system?
[23:10] <murkyMurk> threeseas: you mean you didn't backup before upgrading?
[23:10] <IdleOne> threeseas: what is going on with your machine perhaps we can get it fixed
[23:10] <ThunderStruck> TNDT, that due to the res you have set in /etc/gdm.conf most likely
[23:10] <foug> I get the error "Error Reading Boot CD" when trying to install Ubuntu. Has anyone had this error before? I can't even check the CD for defect's
[23:10] <The_Joe_> I'm on Gutsy
[23:11] <ChrisC35> i'm installing ubuntu (alternate install) for the 1st time, i have a new machine with 2 500gig sata's. I want to set it up with both these in RAID1. Can I set this up in the isntall? right now i'm at the point at paritioning method - guided, lvm etc.
[23:11] <The_Joe_> 500?!!?! *envy*
[23:11] <ThunderStruck> foug, sounds like a bad ISO or bad durn
[23:11] <mpeters> well i figured out the issue my friend was having
[23:11] <IdleOne> !raid | chris0101
[23:11] <ubotu> chris0101: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[23:11] <Innomen> MasterShrek: what are you looking for inside it?
[23:11] <mpeters> network manager failed to detect the WPA encryption type, but when he set it manually, it worked
[23:11] <foug> ThunderStruck: ughh, i hate my life. So I need to redownload ubuntu then?
[23:11] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: AFAIK ubuntyu doesn't support installing to raid1, it might on the alternate disk though.  IMO raid1 is a waste so I haven't looked into it much
[23:11] <mpeters> thanks all
[23:11] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:11] <MasterShrek> Innomen, the medibuntu repositories
[23:11] <Creed> Hirvinen, I have a server setup with vncserver running 7.04, I cant get anything to show up on remote vnc aside from a brown screen, sometimes the gnome loading splash screen with Nautilus loading, anyone have a fix?
[23:11] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:12] <lufis> Anyone else having trouble with pidgin and spellchecxk?
[23:12] <threeseas> The gutsy upgrade failed so badly that it removed snaptic, update manager, aptget and the gnome cd/dvd writer fails
[23:12] <ThunderStruck> foug, yep or check md5sum of the one you have if it is ok burn at lowest speed possible
[23:12] <ChrisC35> RAID1 is the best for backup's sake
[23:12] <arooni_> where do i go in gutsy to tell it to auto index my /home directory?
[23:12] <Innomen> MasterShrek: it in there
[23:12] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, `you had unofficial packages that depended on those
[23:12] <Hirvinen> Creed: Please fix your irc client's nick completion settings.
[23:12] <pulseezar> ok urgent question
[23:12] <foug> ThunderStruck: what's md5sum?
[23:12] <pulseezar> why doesn't my mic work on skype?
[23:12] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:12] <murkyMurk> different backgrounds on each desktop in gnome?
[23:12] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:12] <MasterShrek> Innomen, well then you didnt do: sudo apt-get uodate
[23:12] <Creed> Sorry about that Hirvinen
[23:12] <MasterShrek> update*
[23:12] <pulseezar> mic is unmuted in sound options
[23:12] <Fastn> Does anyone know why Intel 965 chipset is blacklisted of compiz? any information are appricieted
[23:12] <ThunderStruck> !verify | foug

[23:12] <foug> ThunderStruck: nvm i found it, what am i looking for?
[23:13] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: raid1 is NOT a backup
[23:13] <fpauls> how do i install guest additions?
[23:13] <foug> ThunderStruck: it's a big'ol text file
[23:13] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: a backup is a backup
[23:13] <threeseas> it even removed "unknow_command" hehehe
[23:13] <Creed> Hi I have a server setup with vncserver running 7.04, I cant get anything to show up on remote vnc aside from a brown screen, sometimes the gnome loading splash screen with Nautilus loading, anyone have a fix?
[23:13] <ubuntu_Iz> i recentely installed the 915Resolution package to fix my resolution problems in ubuntu 6.06.  by dumb mistake i uninstalled my i810 driver, and edited my xorg.conf to read Driver "915resolution" rather than i810, now X won't start.  can i reinstall the i810 driver and re-edit my conf and return to normalness?
[23:13] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:13] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:13] <oxeimon> what are devel files?
[23:13] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, im 99% sure on that but without seeing the 3 files in /var/log/dist-upgrade its hard to telll
[23:13] <pulseezar> how to make my mic work in skype
[23:13] <riotkittie> dont blame the upgrade, blame whatever unsupported packages you installed :P
[23:13] <Innomen> MasterShrek: running it now
[23:13] <Fryguy--> oxeimon: libraries and source code for developers to program with
[23:13] <ChrisC35> Fryguy-- its a good backup plan against HD failure
[23:13] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:13] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:14] <foug> Is upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10 the same as installing from a 7.10 CD? Will there be any differences in repo's or anything? Will stuff from 7.04 be carried over?
[23:14] <Innomen> MasterShrek: may i suggest that you write a tutorial for how to do this in english and post it somewhere? you're very effective.
[23:14] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: eh. It's ok.  IMO you should be doing proper backups, and if you care about raid for the purpose of raid (redunant data), then raid5 is a better solution
[23:14] <threeseas> I can get it up in failsafe gnome mode but can't do much
[23:14] <pulseezar> urgentness!
[23:14] <NedHiden> pulseezar: go to the sound setting... click the applet on the top panel.
[23:14] <end0r57> does gparted not format in ntfs?
[23:14] <pulseezar> damn it!
[23:14] <MasterShrek> Innomen, the instructions are on medibuntu's website
[23:14] <ubuntu_Iz> anyone have a second to answer an xorg driver question?
[23:14] <Fryguy--> and using raid on an OS install isn't really recommended because if/when things go wrong it becomes somewhat difficult to actually pull data off of the array
[23:14] <Fryguy--> end0r57: it does, just fine
[23:14] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:14] <ChrisC35> Fryguy-- raid1 is safer than raid5
[23:14] <riotkittie> foug: when you install from a CD, you get a clean instal. when you upgrade, your data/settings/ is maintained.
[23:14] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:14] <faiaookami> What about cssm?
[23:14] <Flannel> foug: There wont be differences, except youll still have everything you already installed (and it will be upgraded)
[23:14] <d4rkmonkey> foug updating to 7.10 will just keep all your files that you have right now, and upgrade all programs/repos. Installing from CD you'll have to copy over your files and stuff
[23:14] <Innomen> MasterShrek: in greek
[23:14] <faiaookami> Is that what I'm looking for?
[23:15] <Innomen> MasterShrek: if i knew enough to use those, i wouldent need them
[23:15] <faiaookami> To get  a configuration for compiz
[23:15] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: that's an arguable point
[23:15] <ChrisC35> Its also the best no-downtime backup opiton - just put a new drive in
[23:15] <end0r57> Fryguy--: i'm tying to now but i'm not able to select NTFS as an option. just some native *nix file systems and FAT32.
[23:15] <Innomen> very typical of tutporials, they are written by admins for admins
[23:15] <foug> allright thanks ya'll, my 7.10 CD is broken it seems but my 7.04 works fine i think
[23:15] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, install ubuntu-desktop
[23:15] <ubuntu_Iz> anyone have a second to answer an xorg driver question?
[23:15] <ChrisC35> with Raid5 is something goes wrong during a file write you can get corrupted files
[23:15] <Fryguy--> end0r57: i dunno, worked for me when I used gparted about a week ago
[23:15] <ThunderStruck> threeseas, should fix you if you can get to tty or a term. in GUI
[23:15] <murkyMurk> Innomen: what are you trying to do?
[23:15] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:15] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:15] <Innomen> murkyMurk: getting something to play rm files
[23:16] <Fryguy--> ChrisC35: with poor implementations of raid5 sure.

[23:16] <SuperPigs> ?
[23:16] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: truecrypt
[23:16] <flokuehn> ubuntu_Iz: it must be possible for you to reinstall your needed driver. but i would make an reconfigure of your xorg file instead of editing it manually
[23:16] <murkyMurk> Innomen: the default answer is to use RealPlayer
[23:16] <ChrisC35> besides with these two 500 gigs only cost me $200
[23:16] <arooni_> what is that package to install iefonts (for browsing)?
[23:16] <Pirate_Hunter> the package for compiling stuff in ubuntu is it called build-essentials?
[23:16] <Innomen> murkyMurk: is there one for ubuntu?
[23:16] <SuperPigs> fryguy got it. any other apps?
[23:16] <gcarrillo> hi all, I asked a question about losing audio after upgrading to gutsy a while ago.  Here's the answer: https://bugs.launchpad.net/dell/+bug/131133
[23:16] <Fryguy--> arooni_: :msttcorefonts
[23:16] <The_Joe_> I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[23:16] <ThunderStruck> Pirate_Hunter, yes
[23:16] <The_Joe_> I need to restart X to get it back again
[23:16] <Flannel> Pirate_Hunter: build-essential
[23:16] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: no, truecrypt is the one correct answer for doing secure encryption
[23:16] <ThunderStruck> ah - the s but yes
[23:16] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: RAID is for 1) Uptime 2) up-to-the-last-write backup solution for hardware failure, but is not a real backup solution.
[23:16] <ubuntu_Iz> how would i do that? apt-get install -phigh xorg?
[23:17] <Pirate_Hunter> Flannel, ThunderStruck: thanx

[23:17] <SuperPigs> fryguy how strong is that encryption?
[23:17] <murkyMurk> Innomen: I have always built it from the original binary....takes seconds and is VERY EASY
[23:17] <Jaymac> i upgraded and my gdm logo is the default gnome one. any easy way to get the ubuntu gdm theme?
[23:17] <jdong> lauchazombie / vocx: if you guys are interested, I fixed Azureus ;-)
[23:17] <SuperPigs> fryguy you know?
[23:17] <ChrisC35> Its not an offsite backkup solution, no
[23:17] <The_Joe_> Creed: I'm putting space in between!
[23:17] <The_Joe_> ^^
[23:17] <ChrisC35> but its a great backup solution
[23:17] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: highest that is known about now
[23:17] <luciano_uisk> hi all
[23:17] <Fastn> Does anyone know why Intel 965 chipset is blacklisted of compiz? any information are appricieted
[23:17] <lauchazombie> jdong, really?
[23:17] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: it's the best possible encryption you can do right now
[23:17] <arooni_> Fryguy--, do i need to restart?
[23:17] <PriceChild> !cfblacklist | Fastn
[23:17] <ubotu> Fastn: The following cards are blacklisted in Compiz due to stability & compatibility issues: Intel 965. ATI: Rs480, Rv350. ATI Mobility: x300, x600, x700. More info: http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist/
[23:17] <luciano_uisk> is there a way to change the default screensaver ofgnome?
[23:17] <vocx> jdong, how? This is very interesting...
[23:17] <Innomen> murkyMurk: easy for someone who knows what you mean by that :)
[23:17] <lauchazombie> jdong, master i will worship you forever
[23:17] <Fryguy--> arooni_: no
[23:17] <SuperPigs> fryguy so if someone wanted to break it. how long would it take?
[23:17] <Creed> The_Joe_, advertising every 30 seconds isnt really space...
[23:17] <ChrisC35> it also wont protect against theft
[23:18] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I'm pretty sure it has to do with video issues
[23:18] <riotkittie> Fastn: because it was causing problems for enough people with that chipset
[23:18] <The_Joe_> Creed: I'm anxious....
[23:18] <ChrisC35> but I have had HD's fail so many times
[23:18] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: depends on your specific implementation and stuff.  10s of years probably?
[23:18] <jdong> vocx / lauchazombie : see comments 117 and below by me, and attached gutsy .deb, on bug 57875
[23:18] <murkyMurk> Innomen:trust me, in 5 minutes you will have realplayer under linux
[23:18] <end0r57> Fryguy--: gparted also crashes every time i try to make a change or refresh everything.
[23:18] <Fryguy--> go read the site and learn some of the basics of encryption
[23:18] <luciano_uisk> i wish to use xscreensaver, but its default is the gnome one, ..
[23:18] <ChrisC35> so I am saying screwit, jsut put it in raid
[23:18] <Creed> The_Joe_, tried searching to forums for an answer?
[23:18] <SuperPigs> fryguy because i am using tor as onion proxy and freenet. but i want to encrypt it all now
[23:18] <vocx> PriceChild, we need better aliases for ubuntu factoids...
[23:18] <riotkittie> Fastn: you can override the blacklist.  SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz
[23:18] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I use that chipset, and I have just commented out the lines that blacklist it, but I have to turn it off to watch any videos in totem, or to use myth TV
[23:18] <jdong> vocx / lauchazombie : there you will find the cause of the bug, how I fixed it, my pleas to get it into Gutsy, and basically how I spent my past 4 hours
[23:18] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: well that's different, that's encrypting streams, not files
[23:18] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: It is not a backup solution, period. You're not doing a backup, you're doing RAID. They're different. If corrupt data is written, then that goes into all your drives. A real backup solution can recover from that -- RAID cannot.
[23:18] <Fryguy--> just use ssh tunnelling for that
[23:18] <Innomen> murkyMurk: i believe you
[23:18] <murkyMurk> Innomen: go here http://www.real.com/linux/ and download the file
[23:18] <riotkittie> Fastn: or add SKIP_CHECKS=yes to ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager
[23:18] <d4rkmonkey> riotkittie I would think that just commenting out the lines that blacklist it might be better than stopping it from checking, but I'm not sure
[23:18] <lauchazombie> jdong, again im worshiping you
[23:19] <flokuehn> ubuntu_Iz: just install your needed driver and then du an sudo dpkg --reconfigure xserver-xorg
[23:19] <SuperPigs> fryguy ok i have a ssh tunnel
[23:19] <Innomen> murkyMurk: i may have to, thank you
[23:19] <IdleOne> vocx: if you have any suggestions about factoids you can make them in #ubuntu-ops
[23:19] <flokuehn> ubuntu_Iz: this should work
[23:19] <ubuntu_Iz> how would i make an reconfigure of your xorg file?
[23:19] <SuperPigs> fryguy but i want to encrypt files, streams and everything so :))
[23:19] <jdong> lauchazombie: always glad to help
[23:19] <Fastn> thx for all answers, helped me alot :)
[23:19] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Hence, RAID should be paired with occasional backups.
[23:19] <ubuntu_Iz> thanks guy
[23:19] <murkyMurk> Innomen: when the file is downloaded, tel me where you have put it
[23:19] <ubuntu_Iz> i appriciate it
[23:19] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: truecrypt is the best choice for encrypting files
[23:19] <jdong> and now, I am starving, going to get food. please test the packages if you're interested and report back
[23:19] <Altk> i think i'm having trouble with my video card drivers, when i startup X, all i get is a black desktop and a X as my cursor. I have an ATI X300 card in my laptop. Any ideas?
[23:19] <Pici> vocx: or just suggest the factoids yourself, see !usage
[23:19] <SuperPigs> fryguy i also use extended 3 file format so no deleted files can be recovered
[23:19] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn if you don't want to skip checks, edit /usr/bin/compiz and just comment out the lines that have to do with the chipset
[23:19] <SuperPigs> fryguy ok thanks
[23:19] <ThunderStruck> jdong, welcome to ummmm fun :(
[23:19] <ChrisC35> i agree but for me first comes raid, then i'll setup backups
[23:19] <vocx> IdleOne, Pici  I was just wondering that some factoids have hard to remember names, so an easy alias would be fine
[23:19] <ChrisC35> but i dont want backup without raid
[23:19] <IdleOne> ubuntu_Iz: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[23:20] <flokuehn> ubuntu_Iz: please habe an look in google for the questions will be asked while doing the reconfiguration
[23:20] <jodi2> i have an ubuntu server running can i install gnome or kde but only use it on demand ie the server boots to a promt and not into gnome or kde?
[23:20] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, thx i try that, can it cause any problems
[23:20] <ChrisC35> anyways, should I be setting up different partitions here? I'm in a first time ubuntu install
[23:20] <Fryguy--> raid as part of an operating system install just unecessarily complicates things
[23:20] <ChrisC35> or just 1 partition for the whole drive?
[23:20] <GenNMX> Yes, everyone should RAID 1 at least, not everyone really needs occasional backups
[23:20] <Pici> vocx: suggest them then. !easy is <alias> hardtorememberfactoid
[23:20] <SuperPigs> fryguy i got a ssh tunnel from a guy. but how strong is it? can he monitor everything i do?
[23:20] <IdleOne> vocx: like I said make your recommendations in #ubuntu-ops . if they feel it is warranted they will make the changes
[23:20] <murkyMurk> Innomen: you got that file yet?
[23:20] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Software raid or hardware?
[23:20] <Pici> vocx: in a private message with ubotu preferably.
[23:20] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: yes
[23:20] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: this is the wrong channel for this discussion
[23:20] <Innomen> ok first of all if/when this works MasterShrek what do i open the rm with? totem or mplayer?
[23:21] <ChrisC35> software
[23:21] <Fryguy--> Innomen: mplayer
[23:21] <Innomen> murkyMurk: no, not yet i'm trying to open it with build in players before i download a second player
[23:21] <SuperPigs> fryguy so he can monitor waht i do with the ssh tunnel?
[23:21] <murkyMurk> Innomen: you will use realplay
[23:21] <jodi2> i have an ubuntu server running can i install gnome or kde but only use it on demand ie the server boots to a promt and not into gnome or kde?
[23:21] <Innomen> Fryguy--: thank you
[23:21] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn uh, not really. Totem crashes when I try to watch movies, and I have to turn it off to run MythTV, but thats why its blacklisted. I personally think that its better to just comment out the blacklist lines, instead of making it Skip Checks, because then you only stop the blacklist, not any other checks it might have to do
[23:21] <Fryguy--> SuperPigs: like i JUST said, yes, and like I also just said, this is the wrong channel for this discussion
[23:21] <SuperPigs> fryguy frguy sheesh calm down
[23:21] <Innomen> do i need ot reboot to make this work? does ubuntu work that way?
[23:21]  * SuperPigs away
[23:22] <vocx> jdong, just for the record, I tried azureus in Edgy didn't quite work so I've been using occasionally the tarball... It wasn't a big deal really.
[23:22] <Fryguy--> Innomen: you won't need to reboot
[23:22] <murkyMurk> Innomen: forget that, with out the proprietry realplay codecs many realplayer files simply won't open.
[23:22] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, okey, well do you uncomment it everytime you check mythtv or is it an easyier way to to it?
[23:22] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: I suggest making /boot, /home, /tmp, /usr, and /var partitions all separate.
[23:22] <Fryguy--> vocx: why not try another application for torrenting? like transmission, deluge, rtorrent, or utorrent via wine?
[23:22] <MasterShrek> Innomen, i would use mplayer
[23:22] <MasterShrek> no u shouldnt have to reboot
[23:22] <SlimG> Is it safe to delete /var/lib/dpkg/updates/* when dpkg isn't running?
[23:22] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn no, you just right click, choose appearance, choose visual effects, then turn it to off when I want to use mythTV/totem
[23:22] <Innomen> MasterShrek: is he right? is rm not gunna play?
[23:23] <jdong> vocx: using the tarball is a workaround, not an acceptable solution to the fundamental problem in Ubuntu's azureus package
[23:23] <threeseas> Of course the upgrade didn't show up until its going to be to late to go out and get another drive
[23:23] <Creed> VLC doesnt need codecs (it has its own) to play things on W32, is it the same on ubuntu/*nix?
[23:23] <vocx> Fryguy--, because it's not really my thing. I just wanted to use it. Besides... I like Azureus. Eats memory but so what?
[23:23] <murkyMurk> Innomen: depends on the file...old ones will, new ones might
[23:23] <arooni_> i have both a gutsy laptop & desktop now.  how can i see the files from one comptuer to another?  i dont see the machines in places => network.  what do i need to do?
[23:23]  * Pelo is still trying to figure out how to get bigger emblems
[23:23] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Add / in there too
[23:23] <Lam_> i got my bcm4318 working with ndiswrapper and i can connect to networks fine via NetworkManager, but i can't connect to my hidden network even if i manually enter in the essid and password.  is there a solution to this?
[23:23] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, Okey thx alot :) how do i comment it out trough terminal?
[23:23] <jdong> vocx: my stand is, either we fix the package (which I had done) or remove it altogether and tell users to go get the tarball rather than fooling them with a broken package
[23:23] <MasterShrek> Innomen, not with w32codecs, theres something else you need...one sec lemme find it
[23:23] <Innomen> MasterShrek: i belive i ran the update you wanted me to run
[23:23] <Creed> vocx, tried using utorrent in wine?
[23:23] <Pelo> arooni_, I think you need samba
[23:23] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: This way, if one of the partitions gets screwed up, it doesn't effect the others.
[23:23] <Innomen> MasterShrek: oky, thank you
[23:23] <arooni_> Pelo, ok how hard is that to setup?
[23:23] <MasterShrek> murkyMurk, i havent came across an rm that i couldnt play
[23:23] <ChrisC35> GenNMX althouhg my new MB does come with a raid onboard controller,  ATI SB600 SATA RAID, and comes with a util, WebPAM that i think you install after and setup the raid - should I be using that?
[23:23] <riotkittie> if you value your data, it's common sense to back it up before making serious changes to a system.
[23:24] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Your onboard RAID controller is probably hybrid
[23:24] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I guess you could use nano or vim to edit the file, I just used gedit then searched for intel, and there was a section with all the blacklist then I put # beside each line I was commenting out
[23:24] <murkyMurk> MasterShrek: BBC feeds especially the weather
[23:24] <SlimG> Is it safe to delete /var/lib/dpkg/updates/* when dpkg isn't running?
[23:24] <arooni_> Pelo, isnt there a way to do it by default as part of the OS?
[23:24] <vocx> jdong, exactly. All Ubuntu packages should work. I understand you.
[23:24] <Pelo> arooni_, no idea , there are probably a few howtos around , try in here should be the same proceedure  http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
[23:24] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Linux Software RAID is far superior to any hybrid RAID
[23:24] <codename> Need some video card help
[23:24] <codename> badly
[23:24] <codename> haah
[23:24] <MasterShrek> Innomen, sudo apt-get install
[23:24] <MasterShrek> Innomen, sudo apt-get install non-free-codecs
[23:24] <Pelo> codename, what video card ?
[23:24] <codename> NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT
[23:24] <cdm10> !enter | codename
[23:24] <ubotu> codename: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[23:24] <vocx> Creed, same response... I really don't care. I'm fine with the poisonous frog. Besides, utorrent now belongs to ... you know.
[23:25] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, okey, but i dont have compiz in my /usr/bin
[23:25] <Pelo> codename, start with  meny > system > admin < restricted driver, it that doesn't work use the binari driver
[23:25] <Innomen> MasterShrek: loading
[23:25] <alvaro> alguem br?
[23:25] <ChrisC35> ok i'll try it the linux way then
[23:25] <Creed> vocx, true :( Older versions are fine (I hope!)
[23:25] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn are you on Gutsy?
[23:25] <Pelo> !nvidia | codename
[23:25] <ubotu> codename: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[23:25] <attunix> alvaro: oi
[23:25] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, yes iam
[23:25] <attunix> !br  | alvaro
[23:25] <ubotu> alvaro: Por favor use #ubuntu-br ou #ubuntu-pt para ajuda em português. Obrigado.
[23:25] <alvaro> ok
[23:25] <Creed> codename, you can also try Envy (Google it), worked pretty fine for me.
[23:25]  * murkyMurk is making tea
[23:25] <riotkittie> !envy
[23:25] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[23:25] <kevin1> hello im trying to add a partition to my fstab. I want to know if this entry will work properly; /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 0 1
[23:26] <Pelo> Creed, vocx  bram is not the enemy
[23:26] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: I suggest ~1GB for /, 200MB for /boot, ~2GB for /tmp, ~8GB for /usr, ~16GB for /var, and 1.5x your RAM for swap.
[23:26] <cdm10> I'm having an issue with Evolution... I want to use spamassassin as my junk filter, but when I select it, it says "Spamassasin plugin is not available. Please check whether the package is installed." but I"ve installed spamassassin, and I've enabled the plugin...
[23:26] <lauchazombie> Creed, envy sometimes make a mess but well i admit it worked for gutsy and mi 6100
[23:26] <epp> hey, im trying to compile something, but when i ./configure it says i need intltool 0.23 or later. but i have 0.36
[23:26] <ChrisC35> GenNMX creating these partitions, is that something I do in the Ubuntu install? and do I need the 'alternate install' (I ready for raid and lvm use alternate) - or do I just install ubuntu normally and setup these partitions after install?
[23:26] <Fryguy--> woah GenNMX: why are we making everything into separate partitions?
[23:26] <vocx> Pelo, you got me there... I don't know what bram is.
[23:26] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I don't know why you wouldn't have it, maybe you typed something wrong?
[23:26] <attunix> How do I get Ubuntu to mount my floppy drive? It says "mount: I could not determine the filesystem type, and none was specified."
[23:26] <visik7> I can't start compiz on my 9800 pro with opensource driver I got no Glxfbconfig for default depth
[23:26] <Pelo> vocx, bram is the owner of bittorrent, the new owner of utorrent
[23:26] <GenNMX> Fryguy--: As I said before, it helps recover from partition corruption.
[23:26] <Creed> lauchazombie, yeah I suggest it as a last effort, everything else failed for me (geforce 2 ti) but envy worked, so its good as a last resort.
[23:27] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, well i dont know :/ i checked but in /usr/bin i dont have any file called compiz
[23:27] <end0r57> how can i grant write permissions to a new ext3 partition?
[23:27] <lauchazombie> Creed, it worked for me in edgy sometimes but feisty uffff that made me learn how to live in bash
[23:27] <cdm10> Never mind about my evolution question, I screwed up the spelling of spamassasin :)
[23:27] <epp> hey, im trying to compile something, but when i ./configure it says i need intltool 0.23 or later. but i have 0.36, how would i go about making a link to version .23
[23:27] <Pelo> end0r57, sudo chmod 755 /mountpoint
[23:27] <kevin1> hello im trying to add a partition to my fstab. I want to know if this entry will work properly; /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 01
[23:27] <jrib> !permissions > end0r57
[23:27] <riotkittie> Fastn: then do what i said :P which is the way everyone recommends it anyway :P
[23:28] <GenNMX> Fryguy--: If Linux makes a bad write and corrupts /home, you could at least boot fine until you recover from a backup.
[23:28] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn open a terminal, type /usr/bin/comp then press tab twice and see what comes up? I have no idea why it wouldn't be there...
[23:28] <Fastn> riotkittie, its seems smarter to do that d4rkmonkey say
[23:28] <Creed> Pelo, when a company gets bought over, specially by someone who sides with the MAFIAA, its wise to stop using anything new that gets released from their collaboration until it gets proven that there are no "backdoors" or monitoring tools. I mainly torrent unlicensed anime and linux distros but for many its a darker story.
[23:28] <Pelo> kevin1,  my suggestion is to copy an existing line and edit the devtree and the mount point
[23:28] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Ubuntu will give you the option to setup the partitions, or do it automatically. You want to setup the partitions yourself.
[23:28] <jrib> kevin1: no, 01 is wrong
[23:28] <jrib> !fstab > kevin1
[23:28] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: How many HDDs do you have for RAID, and what size are they?
[23:28] <Creed> lauchazombie, lol I love bash :) I woud live there forever if I could but I was giving this machine to a friend who wanted compiz
[23:28] <Fryguy--> GenNMX: are we launching missile silos or something? since when do linux file systems corrupt often enough to be coming  up with crazy overcomplicated partition setups?
[23:28] <moDumass> hey all, so last friday i "upgraded" distro changed to gutsy, i got compiz workin, but i have no system tray.. i cant tell if some apps are minimised to tray, once in a while i check on system processes and kill a whole lot of apps
[23:29] <Pelo> Creed,  go and review the issue, you are very missinformed
[23:29] <moDumass> how do i get my system tray back
[23:29] <attunix> Creed: lol
[23:29] <moDumass> ?
[23:29] <attunix> moDumass: you mean the panels?
[23:29] <ChrisC35> GenNMX I have 2 500gig satas
[23:29] <alvaro> como passo pra um chat br?
[23:29] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: OK, so you're doing RAID 1.
[23:29] <attunix> moDumass: or the little information bar in the upper right?
[23:29] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, i get this: compiz       compiz.real  compose
[23:29] <Pici> !br | alvaro
[23:29] <lauchazombie> Creed, well that made me love bash especially the browser linxs
[23:29] <ubotu> alvaro: Por favor use #ubuntu-br ou #ubuntu-pt para ajuda em português. Obrigado.
[23:29] <attunix> alvaro: escreve isso:
[23:29] <attunix> alvaro: /join #ubuntu-br
[23:29] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: What will be storing in /home?
[23:29] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn there, compiz, exactly the file you need
[23:29] <cpt> question: I ran the video test in Cedega, i Passed OpenGL, and i failed 3d Acceleration test, I have passed this test before, when i had 7.04. I heard there was some info on the Cedega forums, but that info didnt aply to my problem. I have a intel 915GM card. Anyone able to help me please?
[23:29] <end0r57> Pelo: that doesn't work...
[23:30] <Creed> lauchazombie, links is pretty sweet, comes in handy at work (pretty restrictive firewall...ssh is open though :)).
[23:30] <threeseas> ok, if there are certain directories I should backup to save my personal data what are they ? my home directory with hidden files too and ??? /etc???
[23:30] <ChrisC35> GenNMX yes RAID1. but i would prefer a simple process as possible, as Im just learning , and I need to get this setup today
[23:30] <Pelo> end0r57, try changing the owner  man chown
[23:30] <GenNMX> Fryguy--: "Overcomplicated"? It's the standard setup for most distros.
[23:30] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, so i need to get into /usr/bin/compiz then ?
[23:30] <kevin1> Pelo, jrib, thanks for responding, I did copy an existing one and edited it to what i think is right, is 01 wrong because it needs to be  0 1 ?
[23:30] <Fryguy--> GenNMX: can you name more than 1 distro that makes more than 2 partitions standard?
[23:30] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn yeah, so run something like sudo gedit /usr/bin/compiz
[23:30] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn that'll open up gedit to edit the file
[23:31] <kkathman> !emerald
[23:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about emerald - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[23:31] <kkathman> argh
[23:31] <jrib> kevin1: that is true, but it is still wrong to have a 1 there (see the note at the bottom of "man fstab")
[23:31] <Fastn> okey
[23:31] <Creed> Pelo, I'm not telling people not to use newever utorrent or utorrent in general because of the new owners, I'm simply expressing my opinion on the matter. If I am misinformed then thats my problem :) Everyone has faults...I'll learn the truth when I feel like it, but for now I'd rather just stick to my beliefs.
[23:31] <Pelo> kevin1,  yes,  0 and 1 are seperated
[23:31] <kevin1> jrib, my ubuntu install has that
[23:31] <fpauls> virtualbox help anyone?
[23:31] <GenNMX> Fryguy--: *shrugs* Look it up yourself.
[23:31] <jrib> kevin1: yes, I know
[23:31] <lauchazombie> Creed, well today when i upgraded and had to install mi nvidia driver linxs saved my big time
[23:31] <Pelo> !offtopic | Creed
[23:31] <jrcdude> Hey, can someone help me out in private chat?
[23:31] <ubotu> Creed: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[23:31] <Creed> fpauls, ask away
[23:31] <Creed> !offtopic | Pelo
[23:31] <jrib> kevin1: it is correct for the root partition
[23:31] <ubotu> Pelo: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[23:31] <kevin1> jrib , but for a partitio ot would be wrong?
[23:31] <Fryguy--> GenNMX: I have and I know the answer, which is 0.  I'm wondering why you are making unsubstantiated claims?
[23:31] <jrib> Creed: do not abuse the bot
[23:31] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Well you're installing the server version, right?
[23:32] <kevin1> jrib ok i see
[23:32] <end0r57> Pelo: thanks a lot... got it
[23:32] <fpauls> how do i install guest additions im new to linux
[23:32] <riotkittie> sigh.
[23:32] <jrib> kevin1: right, it should be 2 for other partitions
[23:32] <cosmodad> after upgrading to gutsy, my wifi device's name has changed from wlan0 to eth1. How can I revert that?
=== reconnect is now known as recon
[23:32] <lauchazombie> jdong, your deb make it, again thanks
[23:32] <Skratz0r> UBUNTU PWNS!
[23:32] <Pelo> fpauls,  guest additions ?
[23:32] <Skratz0r> I LOVE IT
[23:32] <lauchazombie> made it*
[23:32] <Skratz0r> :D
[23:32] <ChrisC35> GenNMX no the client install - not server
[23:32] <jrcdude> Can someone help me out with Xserver?
[23:32] <fpauls> in virtualbox
[23:32] <Pelo> jrcdude,  ask a specific question
[23:32] <Skratz0r> hey guys, I  had this one problem
[23:33] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: So you're doing a RAID 1 on your workstation?
[23:33] <Pici> !ask
[23:33] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[23:33] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, is it only this line that i need to comment out? T="$T 8086:2982 8086:2992 8086:29a2 8086:2a02 8086:2a12"  # intel 965
[23:33] <Pelo> fpauls,  you'll hvae to ask in a virtualbox chanel, i think it's  #vbox
[23:33] <ChrisC35> GenNMX my plan is to use ubuntu client ver, and run a vmware centos dev ser in there too
[23:33] <Skratz0r> I coldn't seem to get my ubuntu livecd to get airport to connect to my WIFI
[23:33] <vocx> Attention all users: there is a new subforum on virtualization in ubuntuforums.org   The sticky has a lot of useful information to get you started. Personally I think VirtualBox is really easy for the novice, and is smaller than VMWare Server.
[23:33] <Skratz0r> Any reason why?
[23:33] <rambo3> !nvu
[23:33] <ubotu> kompozer is a WYSIWYG HTML editor for easily creating web pages, and the continuation of the dead Nvu project.  It will be in the Ubuntu repos for 7.10 ("gutsy"); meanwhile for other versions add the following to your /etc/apt/sources.list:  "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/tonyyarusso/ubuntu {edgy,feisty} universe"  (pick your release and list it without brackets, and no quotes)
[23:33] <kevin1> jrib, 0 2? i want to make it readable and writeable for all users, does this look right? -- /dev/sda4 /media/disk ext3 defaults, errors=remount-rw 0 2
[23:33] <ChrisC35> GenNMX yes it will be my file server,  my linux try out workstation, and my dev server running as a vmware
[23:33] <Pelo> Skratz0r, try in the forum
[23:33] <rjonesx> so, I am trying to get the desktop cube back since installing feisty...
[23:33] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I think so, in mine there was another one that also had to do with the intel 965 that said something like x3000 beside it, if thats there comment it out too
[23:33] <jrib> vocx: I am going to ban you if you do that again... you were warned before...
[23:33] <rjonesx> I installed the compiz settings manager
[23:33] <Creed> fpauls, http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/10/13/installing-guest-additions-for-ubuntu-guests-in-virtualbox/
[23:33] <Innomen> MasterShrek: that worked, its a little choppy and slow but its a start, thank you very much
[23:33] <J-_> I don't get it, when I installed gutsy my screen resolution was running at 1024x768 85Hz, now it runs at 1024x768 at 50Hz with no option to bring it back up to 85Hz. What can I do to bring it back to how it was? Or, should I just leave it? the monitor is running at 1024x768 85Hz.
[23:34] <michae2> needing help with a pantech px-500 pcmcia network card. it worked before 7.10 upgrade. please help.
[23:34] <rjonesx> but I can't get the cube to turn on...
[23:34] <cpt> I failed 3D acceleration test in Cedega, I have passed it before on this PC on the 7.04. I have intel 915 card, anyone able to give some assistance please?
[23:34] <GenNMX> Fryguy--: They may be unsubtantiated claims to you, but not to me. It is not my job to provide proof to you. If you want to change my mind, you have to provide proof yourself. Otherwise, this isn't a debate.
[23:34] <Innomen> thanks all :)
[23:34] <jrcdude> Ok, well something should be coming up called "Restart Xserver with each login" under the  System -> Administration -> Login Window, but it doesn't appear there?
[23:34] <MasterShrek> Innomen, what are u using to play it? totem?
[23:34] <Fryguy--> GenNMX: change YOUR mind? i'm the one asking you questions! lol!
[23:34] <Marco> hello
[23:34] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, i think you mean this one? T="$T 8086:2972" # i965 (x3000)
[23:34] <Innomen> MasterShrek: no mplayer
[23:34] <Skratz0r> Hey Marco
[23:34] <jrib> kevin1: I do not know what the errors part does, I usually omit it
[23:34] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: If you want to make it a file server, I suggest using the server (alt) install, not the standard desktop install. The desktop install is quicker, but especially with the complexities of VMWare, you want to make sure you do all this right.
[23:35] <Marco> I've traditionally used linux on a seperate partition
[23:35] <Marco> but I've been reading about WUBI
[23:35] <Skratz0r> - Thanks Pelo, just saw your text. xD
[23:35] <rjonesx> how do i turn back on the desktop cube (beryl on feisty). just installed gutsy gibon
[23:35] <Innomen> nm
[23:35] <Marco> is there any reason not to use WUBI?
[23:35] <Pici> !ccsm | rjonesx
[23:35] <ubotu> rjonesx: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[23:35] <Innomen> MasterShrek: totem works perfectly
[23:35] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn yeah, that also has to do with the chipset, I think thats for like the same chipset on a different graphics card or something, I commented it out to be safe
[23:35] <cpt> what is needed to get that cool 3d box thing when alt tabbing ?
[23:35] <MasterShrek> Innomen, ok, well just make sure you install gstreamer, along with plugins for that, and i installed almost everything that medibuntu had, seems like they run pretty good for me
[23:35] <MasterShrek> oh cool Innomen
[23:35] <Fryguy--> rjonesx: install compizconfig-settings-manager and use that dialog to change the settings to whatever you want
[23:35] <Innomen> MasterShrek: seriously write a tutorial for users like me, it would be helpful to the people i convert to ubuntu
[23:35] <Lunks> Is there any way I can search a windows partition for viruses on Ubuntu/any linux?
[23:35] <Innomen> MasterShrek: you rock
[23:35] <Marco> Lunks: clamav
[23:35] <Innomen> i gotta go
[23:35] <riotkittie> if youve just gone through it, why not write it yourself :P
[23:35] <Innomen> l8r guys, thanks again
[23:35] <ChrisC35> GenNMX I see
[23:35] <MasterShrek> lol Innomen
[23:35] <cosmodad> fonts in Firefox look terrible after Gutsy upgrade. What would be the fix for that?
[23:35] <MasterShrek> later
[23:36] <Creed> Marco, Wubi has some pretty noticable speed issues, specially when copying files or extracting archives. Other than that, its pretty good to try out an OS. I would go with a real physical install though.
[23:36] <Lunks> clamav, ok
[23:36] <J-_> I don't get it, when I installed gutsy my screen resolution was running at 1024x768 85Hz, now it runs at 1024x768 at 50Hz with no option to bring it back up to 85Hz. What can I do to bring it back to how it was? Or, should I just leave it? the monitor is running at 1024x768 85Hz.
[23:36] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: You can get a nice simple install, then install something like gnome, kde, xubuntu, etc. later
[23:36] <kevin1> jrib, now that i edited the fstab, do i have to reboot?
[23:36] <Lunks> I really appreciate the info. :D
[23:36] <rjonesx> yeah, i installed CCSM, and I checked off things like rotate cube, desktop cube, etc...
[23:36] <Fryguy--> kevin1: no
[23:36] <MasterShrek> kevin1, if u want the changes to occur
[23:36] <rjonesx> but it wont work - am I not applying the setting sor something?
[23:36] <Skratz0r> Ubuntu is secure, right?
[23:36] <ChrisC35> GenNMX What I mean by file server, is I'd like to be able to access it from my windoze machine and store files there - a place where I know everything is backed up - like photos, etc
[23:36] <MasterShrek> kevin1, unless you added something, then u shouldnt ahve to
[23:37] <Creed> rjonesx, is compiz running at all?
[23:37] <MasterShrek> Skratz0r, that depends on the user
[23:37] <jrcdude> A setting should be coming up called "Restart Xserver with each login" under the  System -> Administration -> Login Window, but it doesn't appear there?
[23:37] <ChrisC35> GenNMX do I need server for that?
[23:37] <kevin1> yeah i need the changes to occur, i did add something thanks
[23:37] <Pir8> Guys is there a way to set a shortcut in the top bar and calls out an alias that I setup, which actually uses ssh to login to another server ?
[23:37] <verb3k> rjonesx, do you know how to rotate the cube?
[23:37] <altf4> org
[23:37] <Skratz0r> MasterShrek, me? :P
[23:37] <MrKeuner> hi, which one(s) is the bug reporting page for ubuntu eclipse package?
[23:37] <rjonesx> ummm, it used to be holding cntrl and moving to the left or right
[23:37] <Skratz0r> I normally use OS X with mah firewall and UDP disabled
[23:37] <casey_> all right... can someone give me the apt-get commands to upgrade everything to gutsy?
[23:37] <Skratz0r> Can id o this in Ubuntu?
[23:37] <cpt> anyone with some Cedega experience able to answer a question please?
[23:37] <Fryguy--> Pir8: sure, you can add an application launcher up there that executes whatever command you want
[23:37] <DShepherd> Pir8, yeah. you wanna know how?
[23:37] <MasterShrek> Skratz0r, yes it is
[23:37] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Well if you're not running anything like a LAMP then I suppose not.
[23:37] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, Oh this works great :) , what was the only two problems with this chipset?
[23:37] <rjonesx> not working anymore...
[23:37] <casey_> I'm running the development kernel and want to upgrade to the released
[23:37] <kitche> rjonesx: still is just need to enable it since it's disabled by default
[23:37] <Pir8> Fryguy--,  great. Thanks.
[23:38] <verb3k> rjonesx, try pressing the middle mouse button in the desktop and keep holding it and move the mouse
[23:38] <ChrisC35> GenNMX no i'll use virtual machines for the dev servers
[23:38] <MasterShrek> u should be able to Skratz0r, i dont know about disabling udp, but theres sure to be a way, and u dont hve to install a firewall if u dont want to
[23:38] <oxeimon> I'm on an ati graphics card using fglrx, why do I see a diagonal split when I scroll up and down?
[23:38] <ChrisC35> doing all ruby/rails stuff
[23:38] <pwuertz> skarface: if you don't install/misconfigure any additional services like webservers.. and update your system regulary... your system will be rock-solid
[23:38] <murkyMurk> casey_: if you had all the upgrades throughout development then you already have the released version
[23:38]  * rjonesx doesnt have a middle mouse button - laptop
[23:38] <jimmygoon> Who is disabling udp and why?
[23:38] <rjonesx> but the flip doesnt happen at all
[23:38] <rjonesx> it wont move from desktop to desktop
[23:38] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I'm not sure, theres a website somewhere that has to do with all the problems, but I'm not sure where
[23:38] <Pir8> DShepherd,  sure
[23:38] <DShepherd> Pir8, Add to Panel .. there's a custom application launcher button. That should help you out. I think you can just drag and drop stuff on the bar too. Whatever makes you happy
[23:38] <Pirate_Hunter> Is this a correct way to write a directory '/home/pirate/Games/ePSXe\ - /Linux/ePSXe' if it has spaces?
[23:38] <ChrisC35> the main ubuntu install will jsut be for home use
[23:39] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey okey :)
[23:39] <verb3k> rjonesx, when you press win+E   , does anything happen?
[23:39] <DShepherd> Pir8, right-click.. add to panel*
[23:39] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, do you know how i get the cube to work?
[23:39] <jrcdude> Great :( I guess noone knows an anser
[23:39] <jrcdude> answer*
[23:39] <Pir8> ok but what I am trying to do is have that app launcher link call an alias that I setup within the shell :)
[23:39] <Khronnus> I need help about chipset sis (PCI)
[23:39] <casey_> murkyMurk: so its really just upgraded packages and stuff?  I can just apt-get upgradeall and get everything I need?
[23:39] <ChrisC35> GenNMX so then should I be setting up partitions during the install? or after i install ubuntu? and do I really need this alternate install?
[23:39] <rjonesx> i used to just hold the mouse to the right side and it would at least move to the 1 of 4 desktps
[23:40] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[23:40] <Pir8> aaah now I know why it dont work :)
[23:40] <Pir8> n/m
[23:40] <murkyMurk> casey_: sudo apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade    <<<< if you want to but yes, it's just upgraders
[23:40] <kitche> rjonesx: yes compiz-fusion disabled rotate cube by default you need to enable it by checking the box in ccsm
[23:40] <Skratz0r> Cool, MasterShrek
[23:40] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn that program lets you customize things
[23:40] <Pir8> thanks DShepherd  and Fryguy--
[23:40] <Skratz0r> Thanks. :)
[23:40] <rjonesx> i did check the rotate cube box
[23:40] <rjonesx> :-(
[23:40] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Yeah, it'll be simplier to do it during the install
[23:40] <DShepherd> Pir8, no prob
[23:40] <Skratz0r> I cant seem to get it to connect to my WIFI, though. :P
[23:40] <Pirate_Hunter> could someone please answer my question it is for a script
[23:40] <Skratz0r> Does it work off the live cd?
[23:40] <Khronnus> I need help about chipset sis (PCI) !!!
[23:40] <LifeNomad> How do I make something like....beryl and beryl-manager start on login?
[23:40] <vik> Since upgrading to gutsy, my WPA wireless connection has stopped working. Unsecured wireless still works though. Any ideas?
[23:40] <verb3k> rjonesx, how do you know compiz is running on your laptop?
[23:40] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: How much space are you giving your Ubuntu install, total, out of the 500GB?
[23:41] <rjonesx> not sure - i have the cool wobbly effect
[23:41] <Pirate_Hunter> Is this a correct way to write a directory '/home/pirate/Games/ePSXe\ - /Linux/ePSXe' if it has spaces?
[23:41] <Skratz0r> Lol
[23:41] <Skratz0r> The wobbly is nice
[23:41] <rjonesx> yeah
[23:41] <casey_> murkyMurk:  thanks.. theres still 322 packages to be updated ;)
[23:41] <jrib> Pirate_Hunter: enclose it in quotes
[23:41] <Fryguy--> Pirate_Hunter: no, put a \ in front of each space
[23:41] <jdong> lauchazombie: my deb works for you?
[23:41] <ChrisC35> GenNMX i'm in the alternate install - do i need LVM? or should I use the regular install
[23:41] <murkyMurk> casey_: whhops,,,maybe you missed some during development ;-)
[23:41] <rjonesx> its weird, it appears as if, perhaps, the settings manager is not actually affecting my settings
[23:42] <cpt> I failed 3D acceleration test in Cedega, I have passed it before on this PC on the 7.04. I have intel 915 card, anyone able to give some assistance please?
[23:42] <rjonesx> like there should be an "apply now" button
[23:42] <Khronnus> I need help about chipset sis (PCI)
[23:42] <verb3k> rjonesx, that means its on , strange ........try playing with the try looking at the bindings to make suree of them (or change them as you want)
[23:42] <ChrisC35> GenNMX I am giving the ubuntu the total 500 - because I'll jsut install vm's in there for any other servers i need
[23:42] <lauchazombie> jdong, yup it does i little more slow than usual but it does work
[23:42] <casey_> I probably have.  I havn't used ubuntu in after I couldnt get my sound to work.  kind of gave up on it
[23:42] <jrib> Pirate_Hunter: either what I said or what Fryguy-- said, but not both
[23:42]  * rjonesx doesnt understand what bindings are...
[23:42] <jdong> lauchazombie: what's your default Java currently?
[23:42] <LifeNomad> How do you make a program run on login?
[23:42] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, done, how to start? just as any other? just write "compizconfig-settings-manager"
[23:42] <GenNMX> Pirate_Hunter: If you're using 'foo', then you don't need to worry about escaping. For "foo", you only need to worry about event magic characters (like !). Otherwise, use \ for each space.
[23:42] <DShepherd> LifeNomad, at it to your sessions

[23:42] <Pir8> Has anyone gotten dual monitor working in gutsy (specifically with a nvidia geforce 8 series)
=== vik_ is now known as vik
[23:43] <Pir8> I've had no luck with it :(
[23:43] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn its actually ccsm to start, it should also be system>preferences>Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
[23:43] <GenNMX> Pirate_Hunter: Example: mv './Fantasic Foo' './Fantasically Foo'
[23:43] <Pirate_Hunter> GenNMX: so the way i did the directory is correct than? yes/no?
[23:43] <lauchazombie> jdong, 1.5.0
[23:43] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn you might have to change compiz settings to custom though, I'm not sure

[23:43] <rjonesx> any way to preview effects w/ advanced desktop setting
[23:43] <jdong> lauchazombie: install icedtea-java7-jre
[23:43] <casey_> can we safely and effectively write to NTFS yet?
[23:43] <bobgill> I installed Opera from a .deb, how do I completely uninstall it? I forgot, something with --purge or smth
[23:43] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, why do i need to do that?
[23:43] <d4rkmonkey> !ntfs3g
[23:43] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ntfs3g - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[23:43] <jdong> lauchazombie: then you should see a huge speedboost
[23:43] <murkyMurk> casey_ apparently yes
[23:43] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I'm not exactly sure, but I have it set to custom
[23:44] <d4rkmonkey> !ntfs

[23:44] <ubuntu-convert> having some trouble installing ubuntu; i've got a cd installer for 7.04 and i'm having x-window trouble, getting two specific errors, can anyone help me?
[23:44] <casey_> Ahh theres another Casey
[23:44] <tony> Now what do I do?
[23:44] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: OK. So we have the size of /home to worry about. Are you just going to assign the rest of the space to /home, or do something like /home and /mnt/data?
[23:44] <Lost_Soul> please
[23:45] <cpt> I cant seem to get the cube thing to work. Are there something that is needed to get it to work ? I have installed the config thing. CCSM
[23:45] <Pirate_Hunter> GenNMX: so if I put it in double quotes than i dont need to escape is that what your saying?
[23:45] <gunnar> Q:  I would like to recompile my kernel with ubuntu 7.10 and I have been getting a gcc internal compiler error.  Any Ideas?
[23:45] <casey_> where do I find ASACONF?
[23:45] <GenNMX> Pirate_Hunter: Yes.
[23:45] <Fryguy--> gunnar: what is the error
[23:45] <PriceChild> gunnar, why on earth are you compiling your own kernel?
[23:45] <PriceChild> Fryguy--, he's missing build-essential
[23:45] <jdong> gunnar: most likely it means your system has unstable RAM or northbridge
[23:45] <d4rkmonkey> cpt try turning visual effects to custom? I'm not sure, but I guess its worth it to try
[23:45] <Fryguy--> PriceChild: there's plenty of reasons to compile your own kernel
[23:45] <rjonesx> SHIT!
[23:45] <ChrisC35> GenNMX i dont need anything complex - just everything on one partition. dont need a separate partition for data
[23:45] <Pici> !language | rjonesx
[23:45] <jdong> gunnar: perform a memtest for 24 hours, but it's very common for a large compile to catch RAM defects in hardware
[23:45] <ubotu> rjonesx: Please watch your language and topic, and keep this channel family friendly.
[23:45] <riotkittie> cpt: go into CCSM. disable desktop wall. enable desktop cube. enable cube rotate. then go to the GENeral options section, and turn Horizontal Virtual Desktops up to 4
[23:45] <cpt> d4rkmonkey, in what option ?
[23:46] <d4rkmonkey> cpt appearance>visual effects
[23:46] <PriceChild> Fryguy--, and I want to hear his.
[23:46] <cpt> riotkittie, ill try
[23:46] <Marco> gunnar: don't do what jdong says
[23:46] <Pirate_Hunter> Fryguy--: when you say put it in front you mean like this '/home/pirate/Games/ePSXe \-/ Linux/ePSXe' or the way it was before?
[23:46] <Marco> gunnar: that's the most unlikely case
[23:46] <tony> I upgraded to 7.10, and now I can't boot up! I'm getting an error that says bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed
[23:46] <Pirate_Hunter> GenNMX: ok will try that
[23:46] <Marco> gunnar: sudo apt-get install built-essential
[23:46] <jdong> Marco: for a GCC internal compiler error? it's the most likely cause
[23:46] <ChrisC35> GenNMX i know it would be better from an experienced point of view, but being a newbie, I dont want to overwhelm myself with too much to take on, and then not have time to get it done
[23:46] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Well if you separate out your "important data" and "less-important data" partitions, then you can do something like RAID 1 for /, then RAID 5 for /mnt/pub
[23:46] <MrKeuner> what is the proper way of editing the /etc/X11/xorg.conf? dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg? or is there a more appropriate way?
[23:46] <gunnar> I just had a ram module go bad.  I have ran memtest on the one that I am useing.  It is fine.
[23:46] <jdong> Marco: especially considering that you are compiling proper C code, the Linux kernel
[23:46] <eyeR> Hey guys. Anyone an expert in RAID, here? I'm having all sorts of problems with RAID in GUTSY.
[23:47] <honeking> anybody any good with sound problems?
[23:47] <JNLQ> My graphics card doesn't work correctly on the LiveCD unless I'm in "safe graphics" mode. How do I enable this mode (I believe it it using the Vesa driver) after installing to the hard drive?
[23:47] <GenNMX> eyeR: What's the problem? Just ask, don't ask to ask.
[23:47] <Fryguy--> PriceChild: 1 would be as a learning experience, another would be to support some form of esoteric hardware that isn't supported in a standard ubuntu kernel, another would be if you are a kernel programmer doing development, another would be if you are running on a very low-spec system and are trying to save some resources by having a leaner kernel if you know exactly what you need.  If you give me another moment I'm sure I can think of another few reasons
[23:47] <tony> Can anyone help?  installed 7.10, and now I can't boot up! I'm getting an error that says bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed
[23:47] <bobgill> jrib: I did "Mark for complete removal" and now it's not in the list anymore :(
[23:47] <ChrisC35> GenNMX I dont really want to separate it - i have an entire 2nd 500 gig just for the redundancy - if one fails I'll just buy another. I just need it to be simple even if I have to waste HD space
[23:47] <murkyMurk> MrKeuner: the dpkg method jsut sets it back to default setup for the hardware. Personally i edit by hand using vi. YMMV
[23:47] <PriceChild> Fryguy--, I really don't care....? :/ I wanted to know why on earth he thought he needed to.
[23:47] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: OK. So just install everything as normal, then setup raid after the install is finished.
[23:48] <Fryguy--> PriceChild: ah my bad, I thought you were asking me to justify my statement. Carry on then
[23:48] <Skratz0r> If i were to order a cd for my iBook, PPC
[23:48]  * Xacarith has a minor problem.  After installing something a while back he changed what was managing something...  From gnome to kde he thinks but now trying to install the update he's being told that his desktop manager isn't recognized or some such
[23:48] <Skratz0r> would it be PC, or 64?
[23:48] <honeking> my sound just stopped working
[23:48] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Wait, scratch that. That'll be annoying.
[23:48] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, how do i get the cube zoomed out?
[23:48] <ChrisC35> GenNMX so I dont need the 'alternate install' then?
[23:48] <cpt> riotkittie, do i need to reboot or anything ?
[23:48] <PriceChild> Fryguy--, I understand there are valid reasons... but 99% of the time, those asking for help here on that subject shouldn't be doing it in the first place and it shows.
[23:48] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn ctrl+alt+click ?
=== ant00 is now known as antdedyet
[23:48] <Fryguy--> Fastn: everything related to the cube is in compizconfig-settings-manager
[23:48] <RasQulec> I just updated to gutsy, but its not doing smp and I dont see an smp specific kernel in the repos... [dmesg has "NR_CPUS limit 1 reached. Processor ignored" near the top ]
[23:48] <Techrev> Heyas, I'm having issues..  Need helps..
[23:48] <honeking> cube zoomed out would be CTRL ALT and then left click on your mouse and move
[23:49] <vik> Where can I find logs to diagnose where my wireless connection is failing?
[23:49] <eyeR> GenNMX: Yeah. I should know better. Sorry. ... I got the installation done (using dmraid and the standard install process). Then I do a manual installation of grub, restart, then the it makes it to the ubuntu loading bar, but is stuck at the very beginning of the progress bar.
[23:49] <gunnar> I have all the correct software installed.   (build essentials. )  I was able to compile gcc 4.2.2 -- Does any one have it as a deb?
[23:49] <riotkittie> cpt: no it should be working.  try alt + ctrl + left arrow and see if anything happens
[23:49] <flick> how do i remove all kde based applications?
[23:49] <RasQulec> oh envermind, found fix
[23:49] <cpt> riotkittie, it did. anyway to get it to work on alt+tab function ?
[23:49] <Techrev> I had everything working all happy, and wonderful, then I clicked the stupit button to upgrade to 7.10..
[23:49] <bruenig> apt-get autoremove qt will get you close
[23:49] <ChrisC35> GenNMX although maybe I should create a swp partition of about a gig on each HD?
[23:49] <arooni_> i have an intel core 2 duo.  is there any need to use the 64 bit version of ubuntu ( i was hoping for faster speeds ;p ) ?
[23:49] <bruenig> flick,
[23:49] <arooni_> i would have no other reason
[23:49] <gunnar> Also -- I have installed Debian etch and everything works fine.
[23:50] <lauchazombie> jdong, how can i make icedtea default or apt makes it after the installation alone?
[23:50] <riotkittie> cpt: yea, just go back in there and change the keys on the Action tab
[23:50] <RasQulec> it used 386 by default instead of generic
[23:50] <LifeNomad> Does anyone know the command to start Beryl?
[23:50] <hans_> flick: sudo tasksel remove task kde-desktop
[23:50] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/module-details.html#di-setup <-- Ubuntu installer will ask you before writing the partitions to disk.
[23:50] <Fryguy--> arooni_: no.  I would recommend staying with x86 because it runs a bit better
[23:50] <cafuego> arooni; Not if you just use desktop apps, no.
[23:50] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: use compiz-fusion, beryl is deprecated
[23:50] <tony> If anyone can read this, please reply
[23:50] <hans_> flick: or something :)
[23:50] <Techrev> Now everything seems good, but any session I pick the window manager only comes up on 1 monitor.   X is running on all 3, but window managers seem to only see 1 of them..
[23:50] <cpt> riotkittie, well i ment, I would like to have a cube effect on the normal alt+tab funtion
[23:50] <riotkittie> sorry tony can't read it :x
[23:50] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: I know this, but compiz-fusion runs so choppy and slow
[23:50] <Skratz0r> BBL dudes
[23:50] <tony> lol riotkittie
[23:50] <Sir_Sid> where can I view a sample sources.list
[23:50] <Skratz0r> (Idling)
[23:50] <honeking> i think that may be your graphics card
[23:50] <Sir_Sid> Mine has become a little messed up
[23:50] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: so then make it fun smooth and fast?
[23:50] <ferpadro> does anyone knows how to change privileges to a ext3 partition created with gparted?
[23:51] <hajiki> hey after the Gutsy update a new item called "Other" appeared in the Application menu. This other menu is filled with items from a Preferences menu, but they are KDE apps. Can someone explain me why those things are there?????
[23:51] <kitche> cpt: enable it though the compizconfig or ccsm for short
[23:51] <gruntpig> !away | Skratz0r
[23:51] <ubotu> Skratz0r: You should avoid changing your nick in a busy channel like #ubuntu - it causes unrequired scrolling which is unfair on new users. The same goes for using noisy away messages : use the command "/away <reason>" to set your client away silently - See also !Guidelines
[23:51] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Your swap partition should be part of your RAID 1.
[23:51] <lauchazombie> Sir_Sid, in the instalation cd
[23:51] <flick> is there any package on which all kde programs depend?
[23:51] <cafuego> ferpadro: via chmod/chown as per usual.
[23:51] <tony> riotkittie: Sorry, I wondered if maybe I had stumped the room or what
[23:51] <vik> Where can I find logs to diagnose where my wireless connection is failing?
[23:51] <ChrisC35> GenNMX I'm still confused though If I should be using the regular installer, or the 'altnerate' one
[23:51] <honeking> does anyone know how to fix a sound problem?
[23:51] <stefg> flick, sudo apt-get autoremove kdelibs-core should take all other kde stuff witg it as dependency
[23:51] <Sir_Sid> lauchazombie, I dont have that anymore
[23:51] <Xacarith> I'm guessing I need to remove kde off my system maybe?
[23:51] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, well how do i get more desttop-areas , just have two at the moment and want the cube to have 4 sides
[23:51] <casey_> How do I remove the old kernels from my GRUB boot menu?
[23:51] <Fryguy--> honeking: ask the question you really want to ask
[23:51] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: I tried to, but it was not working correctly.  And I could not find the compizconfig-manager app in the repo
[23:51] <stinger05> hi, im in the live cd now, but it's still on the detecting filesystems part while installing,,,it's stuck on it meaning it's not progressing, what can i do ?
[23:51] <flick> stefg, thanks a lot that's what i wanted exactly
[23:51] <mrunagi> hello everyone
[23:51] <ferpadro> cafuego, i see. But "chown" and then what? how is the partition labeled?
[23:51] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn its in CCSM, in General Options at the top
[23:52] <bmk789> casey: you can edit your /boot/grub/grub.conf
[23:52] <vocx> jdong interesting. Although I don't think many people realize the difference between compiling and running with the GCJ or JVM, and Ubuntu package. The "solution" is of course using the tarball. Also, what will happen if people start demanding Azureus 3. I've yet to use it.
[23:52] <tony> Anyone: I upgraded to 7.10 and now my laptop won't boot
[23:52] <GenNMX> eyeR: In the Grub menu, edit your boot line and remove -splash. Then you can see where it stops at. How long did you wait at the progress bar?
[23:52] <Techrev> Sigh, is there any channel I can go into where they might know what the issue is?
[23:52] <DarKMod1> hello i need some help with my network connection
[23:52] <jrib> bobgill: yes, so it is gone
[23:52] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Just use the regular one.
[23:52] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: so then address the issue of what's causing you to be unable to find the compizconfig-settings-manager and work from there.  Make sure you have 3d acceleration enabled, etc
[23:52] <jdong> vocx: Debian is working on uploading Azureus 3 in their existing packaging format
[23:52] <cpt> kitche, you mean that i can get a cube effect on the windows i have on 1 desktop to be in the cube ?
[23:52] <bobgill> how can I get it back ??
[23:52] <jdong> vocx: it's a simple sync in to Hardy, then backport to Gutsy
[23:52] <Lunks> Where do I find gnome appearance files on my home folder?
[23:52] <GenNMX> eyeR: You have about 10 seconds to hit ESC before Grub starts to get the Grub menu.
[23:52] <DarKMod1> any body valuable to help
[23:52] <jrib> bobgill: install it again
[23:52] <Xacarith> any one have any input?
[23:52] <Lunks> like window controls, etc.
[23:52] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, thx alot
[23:52] <ferpadro> cafuego, r u there?
[23:53] <Fastn> :D
[23:53] <jrib> !opera > bobgill
[23:53] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn no problem
[23:53] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: I just cannot DL that application to make changes to the manager.
[23:53] <juanbond> when i do a ls -la on my created directory (downloads) it has root root, i can't seem to copy any files to there.  how can give myself permissions to write to that directory?
=== antdedyet is now known as ant00
[23:53] <Techrev> Is there an Xwindows support channel or something?
[23:53] <bmk789> !u > ferpadro
[23:53] <jdong> vocx: point is, now that it is built the way I packaged it, the end user won't have to worry about anything. It runs with EVERY JRE in our repositories now :)
[23:53] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: why can't you download it?
[23:53] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: The only option I have are to enable 3d windows, and wobbly
[23:53] <jrib> Techrev: this one
[23:53] <lauchazombie> jdong, how can i make icedtea default or apt makes it after the installation alone?
[23:53] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: It is not in the repositories
[23:53] <honeking> when i open my volume control, it says this: "No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found."
[23:53] <casey_> what is the preferred text editing program now?
[23:53] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: so enable the proper repositories so it IS there
[23:53] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, damn , still just got 2 sides of the cube
[23:53] <derrrface> I upgraded to 7.10... accessing web sites take a long time while "looking up...." for it to fetch, as well as fetching images in my email client.... from .5 seconds to bout 4 seconds....
[23:53] <jrib> casey_: whatever you prefer
[23:53] <Fryguy--> because it's in everybody else's repositories in here
[23:53] <d4rkmonkey> Fastn I have no idea then, sorry
[23:54] <jdong> lauchazombie: APT should make it default. run "sudo update-alternatives --config java" to verify
[23:54] <bmk789> casey_: you can use gedit or nano are probably the easiest
[23:54] <LifeNomad> Fryguy--: I enabled all of the repos...and its still not there
[23:54] <Techrev> kk, anyone have any idea what is wrong then?
[23:54] <casey_> jrib: i used to use kate but it wasnt in my gutsy install
[23:54] <honeking> well, that's the problem, all the right gsteamer plugins and alsa are enabled
[23:54] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: then your repository list is broken
[23:54] <honeking> *gstreamer
[23:54] <murkyMurk> juanbond: sudo chown <user> <directory> -R; chgrp<user><directory> -R
[23:54] <Lunks> Where do I find gnome appearance files on my home folder? Like window controls, etc.
[23:54] <jrib> casey_: you can install it if that is what you like
[23:54] <vocx> jdong, didn't even know about that icedtea... Or maybe I did...
[23:54] <juanbond> thank you murkyMurk
[23:54] <Techrev> Was working fine under 7.04, upgraded, and boom, window manager only sees 1 monitor..  Haven't changed xorg.conf
[23:54] <Fryguy--> LifeNomad: http://rattlesnake.ath.cx/compizconfig.png
[23:54] <GenNMX> ChrisC35: Go to that link I gave you and read the section called "Configuring Multidisk Device (Software RAID)"
[23:55] <jrib> Lunks: what do you want to do exactly?
[23:55] <stinger05> hi, im in the live cd now, but it's still on the detecting filesystems part while installing,,,it's stuck on it meaning it's not progressing, what can i do ?
[23:55] <ChrisC35> GenNMX alright thanks - i will try the regular. When you say the swp partiton should be part of the raid1 - do I actually make each HD 2 partitions, 499gig and 1gig for swp - and setup raid which is for the whole drive - or do I just partition the whole drive as 1 partition , and then setup raid, and the swp is handled automatically
[23:55] <jdong> vocx: I would've built with sun-java5 or sun-java6, btu both are in multiverse and unusable on the Ubuntu builders, because they pop up the license agreement and nobdoy's there to agree to it!
[23:55] <lauchazombie> jdong, a huge speed change indeed i dont have enough thanks for you
[23:55] <ChrisC35> GenNMX ok I will do that
[23:55] <seila> hi there
[23:55] <BobSinclair> Hi
[23:55] <cpt> question: I ran the video test in Cedega, i Passed OpenGL, and i failed 3d Acceleration test, I have passed this test before, when i had 7.04. I heard there was some info on the Cedega forums, but that info didnt aply to my problem. I have a intel 915GM card. Anyone able to help me please?
[23:55] <jdong> lauchazombie: it's Ubuntu -- it's what we do for each other :)

[23:56] <Lost_Soul> Its very dificult optimization wifi ??
[23:56] <ChrisC35> Windows is necessary, due to games
[23:56] <ferpadro> does anyone knows how to change privileges to a partition?

[23:56] <Skratz0r> :O
[23:56] <Skratz0r> VMware?
[23:56] <seila> Fryguy-- hi can you tell me a good chanel plllz
[23:56] <eyeR> GenNMX: I did that. It's giving me an error about not being able to find my raid partition (/dev/mapper/via_bjgffdcjia2) ... I tired changing it to /dev/mapper/viabjgffdcjia (meaning I told it the kernel was on the whole disk). I'm booting now. Don't think that will do it

[23:58] <lauchazombie> jdong, sorry but what is "the motu's "?
[23:58] <honeking> anyone know how to fix a sound problem where the volume control spits out this message when you try to open it: "No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found."
[23:58] <Techrev> Or, I need to turn off xinerama in xgl, and load it for each screen, but that I think will be a headache..

[23:58] <ubotu> lauchazombie: motu is short for Masters of the Universe. The brave souls who maintain the packages in the Universe section of Ubuntu. See  http://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU
[23:59] <casey_> I just found out there is a "Xubuntu".  Is there anything specific about it that would make me want it?
[23:59] <jrib> Leftmost: really, there are sections that claim you can change the default options in there.  Have you tried and it did not work?
[23:59] <murkyMurk> Lunks: system->preferences->appearance or sys->pref->windows
[23:59] <bruenig> casey_, xfce is the best de
[23:59] <Fryguy--> casey_: it uses XFCE instead of GNOME by default
=== juaroj is now known as danroj
[23:59] <Lunks> murkyMurk: on my home folder, I'd like to copy them somewhere else.
[23:59] <casey_> bruenig: so thats all it is? a different gui?
[23:59] <eyeR> GenNMX: In the load process, right after it recognizes all my USB devices, it lags for al ong time then says "check root= bootarg cat /proc/cmdline or missing modules, devices: cat /proc/modules ls /dev" ... " ALERT! /dev/mapper/bjgffdcjia2 does not exist. Dropping to shell!" then it puts me in BusyBox
[23:59] <Fryguy--> casey_: there's kubuntu too, that uses KDE by default.  short of what they install by default, they are all the same (you can install xfce on ubuntu if you wanted to, or install gnome on xubuntu if you wanted to)

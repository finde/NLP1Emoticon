[12:01] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:01] <sybariten> i had like 400 megs in there ... how the kfcu is one supposed to know where to look for files moved to thrash? cause its not visible from the desktop or so, is it?
[12:01] <darwin188> hello, i need some help with ubuntu
[12:01] <darwin188> i just installed it to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:01] <amphi> sybariten: I'd have thought so; I don't use gnome
[12:01] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:02] <hedrek> !amarok
[12:02] <ubotu> I guess amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
[12:02] <sybariten> amphi: neither would i... if i was sure i wouldnt lose stuff by changing
[12:02] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:02] <amphi> sybariten: lose stuff?
[12:02] <I_Love_DRM> Isn't the "thrash can" on the bootom right? next to the 4 desktop screen selectors.
[12:02] <Amin> !bash
[12:02] <ubotu> For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
[12:02] <Amin> !init
[12:02] <ubotu> Init is how Ubuntu starts up misc. system services at boot time.  To control the services, please install the package "BUM" from "Universe" Repository
[12:02] <sybariten> amphi: you know ... uh .. the terminal here in gnome has tabs, and it has choices to change char emulation instantly. could i do that under xfce, etc etc
[12:02] <sybariten> loose stuff like that
[12:03] <jayrod06> !Aac
[12:03] <ubotu> methinks aac is read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information about aac support
[12:03] <crazy_penguin> night all! // jo ejt!
[12:03] <AlwaysIcey> Yep. I was just about to mention that I_Love_DRM.
[12:03] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:03] <amphi> sybariten: guess so; just use gnome-terminal I suppose; I use mrxvt for tabbed xterms
[12:03] <sybariten> I_Love_DRM: you have a thrashcan there ?
[12:03] <darwin188> i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:03] <darwin188> can anyone help me out?
[12:03] <AlwaysIcey> I do too.  it looks like a calculator on my screen, but it's a trash can.
[12:03] <cr1mson> How do I correct 'dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)' ?
[12:03] <sybariten> amphi: but i couldnt use gnome-terminal under antyhing but gnome could i
[12:04] <amphi> darwin188: you need to mess with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess
[12:04] <nelisa> hey folks, newcommer here
[12:04] <amphi> sybariten: why not?
[12:04] <cr1mson> I'm trying to install glibc
[12:04] <darwin188> and then?
[12:04] <colliier88> how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> hola
[12:04] <amphi> sybariten: AFAIK it's a standalone prog (albeit with a lot of shared lib deps probably)
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> alguien que sepa de linux que me ayude
[12:04] <Old> "rpm -U webmin-1.260-1.noarch.rpm" - this command doesnt seem to work for me, any ideas of how to use a. rpm file?
[12:04] <AlwaysIcey> Claudia, hablas ingles?
[12:04] <Old> I need to install it
[12:04] <bimberi> ompaul: yes i like the new edubuntu background too - although it's a kinda cold and is missing New Zealand (bug reported) :)
[12:04] <nelisa> is there a way to lower my screen resolution, Ubuntu loaded tops and is hard on my eyes
[12:04] <CLAUDIA> no
[12:04] <amphi> !tell CLAUDIA about es
[12:04] <AlwaysIcey> !es
[12:04] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[12:04] <gnomefreak> Old: ubuntu is debian not redhat
[12:04] <sybariten> amphi: i thought gnome stuff required gnome as the window manager (althouih its prolly bigger than just a window manager today) to run, just as all K-programs (Kdevelop an all) would require KDE ... etc
[12:04] <ompaul> bimberi, :-)
[12:05] <Amin> !rpm
[12:05] <ubotu> methinks rpm is the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
[12:05] <nelisa> hola CLAUDIA
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Old: ubuntu uses .debs not .rpms
[12:05] <Old> ooh
[12:05] <CLAUDIA> hola nelisa
[12:05] <Amin> !alien
[12:05] <ubotu> somebody said alien was a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[12:05] <gnomefreak> CLAUDIA: #ubuntu-es
[12:05] <Old> Is there a way to use .rpms, like renaming it or something?
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Amin: alien isnt really recommended to use
[12:05] <amphi> sybariten: you can run kde progs without kde (you still need the libs), same for gnome; I run gnome progs like gthumb here without gnome
[12:05] <gnomefreak> Old: find a deb
[12:05] <Madpilot> Old, there's "alien", but you should look for a deb first
[12:05] <CLAUDIA> gracias
[12:05] <aj_> how do you add backports to dapper? like so i can get lame debs?
[12:05] <amphi> CLAUDIA: de nada
[12:06] <Old> gnomefreak i cant tbh, this guide is old, and i bet the file isnt on google anymore
[12:06] <Old> I'll look
[12:06] <gnomefreak> Old: what is the app?
[12:06] <CLAUDIA> sabes espaol
[12:06] <Madpilot> aj_, there won't be any backports for Dapper yet - development of the next version hasnt' started yet
[12:06] <sybariten> ok next question ...  if i compile something and then do make install in order to get it in place.... (in this case irssi) .. and i already had that tool installed via apt-get ... will make be able to "overwrite" my old version, and will the apt-system know that i got a new version of the irc client??

[12:06] <sybariten> amphi: ok didnt know that
[12:06] <robertj> are there any good wiki pages for setting up software mixing of sound?
[12:06] <nelisa> how to lower the res
[12:06] <robertj> I can't get my sdl games & teamspeak to play nice
[12:06] <aj_> so you can't get lame or mythtv in a repo?
[12:06] <Old> gnomefreak, it's webmin, for administrating your counter-strike servers (game servers)
[12:07] <Old> http://mirrors.redwoodvirtual.com/mirrors/www.webmin.com/download.html
[12:07] <gnomefreak> aj_: did you enable universe and multiverse
[12:07] <aj_> yes
[12:07] <Old> Can i use any of those?
[12:07] <gnomefreak> !webmin
[12:07] <ubotu> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported
[12:07] <disinterseted_pe> how do i go about finding out about this 'mmsh://a814.l1977144512.c19771.g.lm.akamaistream.net/D/814/19771/v0001/reflector:44512?MSWMExt=.asf'.
[12:07] <amphi> sybariten: some of the integration stuff may not work (those DEs must be for _something_ ;), but the individual profs should work
[12:07] <lurk3rX> dis, thats a windows media player link :p
[12:07] <Old> thanks gnomefreak, i'll just take a peak
[12:07] <lurk3rX> i think
[12:08] <AlwaysIcey> Yep. That's what it is Lurk3rX

[12:10] <MENDIGO> mkdir /var/lib/apt/lists/br.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_universe_binary-i386_Packages would help?

[12:10] <coucho> i can't get vnc server to work properly, again, anyone interested in helping me?
[12:10] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, how to get more res enabled?
[12:11] <amphi> MENDIGO: no

[12:11] <nelisa> if I get a workable ress I would do better
[12:11] <coucho> nelisa: i'm still in those XD

[12:12] <mikebot> anyone know why my mplayer always gives me the error "New_Face failed. Maybe the font path is wrong. Please supply the text font file (~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf)."
[12:12] <RandolphCarter> http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/5/21/4048 - bye bye Ballmer :)
[12:12] <AlwaysIcey> How about the refresh rate, what options are there?

[12:12] <RandolphCarter> mikebot: did you install the mplayer-fonts package?
[12:13] <Old> gnomefreak, read above. Could you help me perhaps?

[12:13] <Old> nice job btw

[12:13] <coucho> nelisa: maybe you're able to help me out?
[12:13] <gnomefreak> Old: that should be the path iirc
[12:13] <AlwaysIcey> Is it an older computer nelisa?
[12:13] <amphi> RandolphCarter: ah, the purges begin ;)
[12:13] <Old> gnomefreak, what's the exact path (Im new to ubuntu)
[12:13] <nelisa> it's a laptop an HP Pavilion N5495
[12:13] <gnomefreak> Old: i dont do much with perl except use it in scripts
[12:14] <MENDIGO> nelisa, no, i was going to update to Dapper Drake but then when i saw that would have to download 500mb I choose to Cancel
[12:14] <xdica> hi olks
[12:14] <gnomefreak> Old: /usr/bin/perl
[12:14] <mikebot> RandolphCarter, how do i do that?
[12:14] <Nintendud> I just installed the 686 optimized kernel for Ubuntu, and now mplayer and xmms don't run. if I launch them from the command line, it just says "segmentation fault". I recompiled mplayer, but it still says the same error. any ideas? I tried googling, and maybe the nvidia X driver is related to this problem (I had a bit of a problem getting X to work with the nvidia driver when I installed the kernel, but it eventually worked)
[12:14] <guenni> hallo
[12:14] <Old> cheers gnomefreak
[12:14] <RandolphCarter> mikebot: sudo aptitude install mplayer-fonts
[12:14] <mikebot> RandolphCarter, thanks
[12:14] <AlwaysIcey> I'm not sure then nelisa.  I haven't tried this on a laptop, so I'm not too sure how what resolution options you should have.
[12:14] <MENDIGO> nelisa, I did a backup of the sources.list then i replace it with the backup and did a apt-get update
[12:15] <Old> thanks, It's installing now gnomefreak.
[12:15] <HellDragon> hi , im on a live cd how can i partitionate my HDD
[12:15] <HellDragon> what software i need
[12:15] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: you need to install the linux-686 package
[12:15] <HellDragon> ubuntu breezy live cd
[12:15] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: I did
[12:15] <Nintendud> ;p
[12:15] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, how do I poll my hardware for more res options?
[12:15] <RandolphCarter> hmm, so it can't be missing the nvidia kmod :(
[12:15] <guenni> whois guenni
[12:15] <Nintendud> oh wait
[12:15] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: looks like I didn't. wtf o_O

[12:16] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: :P np's
[12:16] <ruchbah> >hand<
[12:16] <dell500> anyone here know a bit about raid? specifically raid0
[12:16] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: would I have to restart? they still segmentation fault
[12:16] <AlwaysIcey> nelisa, possibly in System > Administration > Device Manager.
[12:16] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: yup, you'd need to restart
[12:16] <sybariten> ruchbah: can you see if you can do /set term_char ?
[12:16] <Nintendud> thought so
[12:16] <Nintendud> or at least, restart X
[12:16] <greg_> has anyone used automatix?
[12:16] <RandolphCarter> hmm, probably best to reboot
[12:16] <coucho> dell500: depends on what you wanna know
[12:16] <Nintendud> alright
[12:16] <Nintendud> brb
[12:16] <amphi> sybariten: yeah
[12:17] <RandolphCarter> there's some messages about loading restricted modules at startup :) gl
[12:17] <Nintendud> alright, thanks
[12:17] <Nintendud> if I'm not back, all is well
[12:17] <sybariten> amphi: yes you run it or yes you can do /set blabla ?
[12:17] <varunvarde2007> hello all
[12:17] <varunvarde2007> need some help
[12:17] <sybariten> termchar even
[12:17] <varunvarde2007> :(
[12:17] <dell500> coucho, well i have a raid0 array... i made the array with the onboard software (prog that came on the mobo) and i am using it in linux (kubuntu 5.10)
[12:17] <varunvarde2007> hello can anyone help me????????????
[12:17] <coucho> dell500: and what's the problem?
[12:18] <dell500> coucho, what I would like to do is get another large SATA and just back everything up on it, then use the 2 other sata's for OS's
[12:18] <amphi> sybariten: yes I use it ;)
[12:18] <ompaul> !helpme
[12:18] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[12:18] <amphi> sybariten: "Irssi: Unknown setting term_char" - what's that supposed to do?
[12:18] <dell500> I was just wondering if it's possible to get a new mobo that has more than 2 satas to hook it up so the transfer of 200gb of data to be copied will be faster
[12:18] <varunvarde2007> i want to configure dns server on the Ubuntu Machine can anyone teach me how can i do it??
[12:19] <RandolphCarter> dell500: if you've got a third drive, maybe raid4?
[12:19] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, what I'm looking for??
[12:19] <coucho> dell500: why wouldn't it be possible?
[12:19] <sybariten> amphi: solve my problems  :)
[12:19] <sybariten> amphi: according to the bitches in my regular swedish chan
[12:19] <amphi> sybariten: WAYTTD?
[12:19] <ruchbah> sybariten doesn't seem to do anything.  This is the first time I've used irssi.  Just trying it out
[12:19] <RandolphCarter> dell500: and sure, you can always get a PCI SATA-2 card and use linux's software mirroring too
[12:19] <dell500> coucho, i've only got 2 SATA ports for raid
[12:20] <varunvarde2007> anyone there?
[12:20] <sybariten> amphi: what does that abbreviation mean ?
[12:20] <RandolphCarter> it's almost as fast, and you can just put the drives in another machine without it breaking horribly
[12:20] <AlwaysIcey> nelisa, in Device Manager, you'll be looking for the Display Adapter or something similar to that.
[12:20] <coucho> dell500: i understand, but why would it not be possible for you to get a new mobo that supports raid on more than 2 sata ports?
[12:20] <sybariten> ruchbah: ok thanks ... hmmm but did you get an error or not? try a termchar that doesnt exist, like /set term_char banana
[12:20] <amphi> sybariten: !wayttd is <reply>"what are you trying to do?"
[12:20] <dell500> RandolphCarter, my "vision" is to get all the data stored on one SATA drive, then enclose it, use it as USB, then use the RAID0 array (2 120 SATAs) to split up and use for OS
[12:20] <darwin188> i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:21] <dell500> coucho, i was wondering if it might destroy the raid array i have now and i would lose all my music and stuff... that wouldn't be good
[12:21] <ompaul> varunvarde2007, http://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/en_GB/dns.html
[12:21] <darwin188> can anyone help me out?
[12:21] <coucho> dell500: ah like that
[12:21] <varunvarde2007> thanks checking it out in a second
[12:21] <RandolphCarter> dell500: you won't be able to move the drives to a new mobo
[12:21] <RandolphCarter> dell500: super, mega, definitely not
[12:21] <dell500> ok
[12:21] <dell500> lol
[12:21] <greg_> has anyone had problems using automatix?  specifically firefox
[12:21] <RandolphCarter> and this is the problem with hardware RAID :)
[12:21] <sybariten> amphi: ok, i'm trying to set IRSSI to get the character "emulation" (or whatever you call it) ISO-8859-1 ... aka "western"
[12:21] <ruchbah> sybariten .. nope.  No error.
[12:21] <RandolphCarter> (unless they're not in a RAID atm)
[12:21] <ompaul> varunvarde2007, you will also need to read that howto at the bottom its far too much to do in irc
[12:21] <gnomefreak> greg_: dont use it
[12:21] <sybariten> ruchbah: ok, then it works for you ... dang
[12:22] <dell500> RandolphCarter and coucho, I guess I could just get an enclosure and copy via USB... but 200gb over usb scares me
[12:22] <coucho> dell500: i would advise you to get the disk, and get norton ghost or something to create an image and put that on your new hd
[12:22] <greg_> why not?
[12:22] <amphi> sybariten: no idea about that I'm afraid
[12:22] <gnomefreak> !automatix
[12:22] <ubotu> automatix is, like, totally, unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
[12:22] <gnomefreak> ^^^ greg_
[12:22] <disinterseted_pe> this is giving me an anurisum
[12:22] <coucho> dell500: then just undo the array and reinstall everything
[12:22] <RandolphCarter> dell500: wouldn't be so bad, just leave it going overnight, probably take 3-4 hours?
[12:22] <phace> is there a way to check my hard drive. to analyse it for bad sectors etc... it's an external hdd on fat32
[12:22] <dell500> coucho, u can do that?
[12:22] <ompaul> greg_, if you use it, and you break your machine you will reinstall
[12:23] <vlad> anyone know how to make a .deb package of firefox 1.5 from source?
[12:23] <`RaSh> how can i know what ports i have open?
[12:23] <amphi> phace: badblocks
[12:23] <gnomefreak> !ff1.5
[12:23] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[12:23] <gnomefreak> vlad: ^^^
[12:23] <vlad> gnomefreak, thanks
[12:23] <gnomefreak> vlad: ywe
[12:23] <gnomefreak> -e
[12:23] <greg_> yeah it did break my machine
[12:23] <coucho> dell500: of course, but everything that was on the array will be gone (or at least not accessible)

[12:23] <AlwaysIcey> Rash, try netstat -an or netstat --help for options
[12:23] <greg_> i lost firefox
[12:23] <dell500> coucho, but that's pretty much a complete backup of it all? how safe is it?
[12:24] <PyroMithrandir> leojstewart, because you don't have your CD in
[12:24] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, only video related thing is 82830 CGC
[12:24] <coucho> dell500: i don't think you have to worry about it, unless you get a crappy image maker
[12:24] <RandolphCarter> ghost's very safe, just do an integrity check afterwards
[12:24] <coucho> exactly
[12:24] <AlwaysIcey> I'm not sure what to tell you then nelisa.  Have you tried in the #ubuntu-laptop room?
[12:24] <PyroMithrandir> leojstewart, it should run fine anyway, though
[12:24] <dell500> is there a good one for ubuntu?
[12:24] <eugman> Of course the forums go down right before
[12:25] <dell500> one that doesn't crash? :)
[12:25] <eugman> I make a post.
[12:25] <leojstewart> Pyro: it does. Thank you. I was just wondering
[12:25] <coucho> dell500: most of those work outside an OS
[12:25] <coucho> dell500: ghost does anyway
[12:25] <leojstewart> I wasn't doing it before... I wonder why it is now.
[12:25] <dell500> ohhhh
[12:25] <dell500> gotcha
[12:25] <RandolphCarter> dell500: tar | bzip is farely safe and doesn't crash :)
[12:25] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, they sent me back to #ubuntu
[12:25] <RandolphCarter> *fairly
[12:25] <dell500> RandolphCarter, I've had some problems with tar'ing things
[12:25] <dell500> idk why
[12:26] <eugman> Nelisa, You need to find a way to make the equivalent of a conference call it would seem.
[12:26] <PyroMithrandir> leojstewart, if you don't want to see that error, you can comment out the line from /etc/apt/sources.lst that checks the CD
[12:26] <coucho> dell500: i would get ghost, you can boot up and just copy your entire hd array to your new disk
[12:26] <eugman> But seriously, I hope you get help.
[12:26] <dbcalo> can i open terminals so they're already set to the folder i want them to be in?
[12:26] <leojstewart> Pyro: sorry, but I'm a linux-newbie.  Could you tell me exactly how to do this?
[12:26] <RandolphCarter> ghost only works with ext2/ext3 atm though (don't think it works with reiser)
[12:27] <coucho> dell500: i would probably allocate that disk first
[12:27] <AlwaysIcey> The only other place I could recommend is maybe the accessibility chat room.  Otherwise, I'll leave it up to someone else here, since I haven't configured Devices manually or used a laptop with Ubuntu.
[12:27] <coucho> dell500: which fs do you use?
[12:27] <Nintendud> :(
[12:27] <Nintendud> didn't work
[12:27] <Nintendud> still segmentation faults
[12:27] <PyroMithrandir> leojstewart, you can do it in synaptic. open it up and go settings>repositories
[12:27] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: erk :/
[12:28] <jlunder> Hey, I have a little question about getting new hardware working in an existing ubuntu breezy installation, I was hoping someone here could help?
[12:28] <PyroMithrandir> then uncheck the "CD disk with Ubuntu..."
[12:28] <eugman> dbcalo , How do you define the ones you want them to be in? Do you want to pick them from nautilus or do you want the terminal to have a different default or something else?
[12:28] <amphi> !tell jlunder about ask
[12:28] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: then again, I probably should have watched that apt-get more carefully; since it didn't have any dependencies to install, so I think everything in that respect was up to date
[12:28] <Ademan> when i try and shut down ubuntu on my laptop it just goes blank screen and nothing happens, none of the diagnostic messages "shutting down root file system" or anything, just blank screen, never powers down either.  What do you guys think is wrong?
[12:28] <Tuzlo> php5 and gd lib support, what do I have to do to ensure that  php is compiled with GD lib support/?
[12:28] <Nintendud> since apt-get install linux-686 only downloaded a 22.4KB file ;p
[12:29] <HellDragon> hi, how can i install LILO from a live cd , i just broke grub and ill install lilo to replace it
[12:29] <HellDragon> :(
[12:29] <Old> anyone got any ideas of how to remove the other modules from webmin ?
[12:29] <Nintendud> man, I can't live without mplayer
[12:29] <HellDragon> http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration doing that doesnt work
[12:29] <dbcalo> eugman, i was hoping i could open them up with nautilus. i remember i used to be able to do such a thing but have since forgotten how to do so.
[12:29] <Nintendud> xmms I don't care much about, unless I want to spam music in IRC
[12:29] <amphi> Nintendud: heh
[12:29] <Blissex> HellDragon: there are plenty of other GRUB tutorials/HOWTOs...
[12:29] <coucho> what's the disk info command again?
[12:29] <Nintendud> but still
[12:29] <Nintendud> :/
=== Sir_Squirrel is now known as McScruff
[12:29] <`RaSh> can anyone tell why im able to send in AMSN but im not able to send here in IRC
[12:29] <HellDragon> but i want to use lilo
[12:29] <HellDragon> not grub anymore
[12:29] <darwin188> how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:29] <HellDragon> it always break
[12:29] <ruchbah> jlunder - what have you got?
[12:30] <HellDragon> every week it breaks
[12:30] <Blissex> `RaSh: some channels require you to have a registered user name.
[12:30] <darwin188> i will appreciate a lot the help
[12:30] <amphi> HellDragon: you boot every week??
[12:30] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: hmm :/ not sure what I can recommend
[12:30] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: :(
[12:30] <coucho> what's the disk info command again?
[12:30] <HellDragon> amphi, every day
[12:30] <`RaSh> its not here.
[12:30] <leojstewart> PyroMithrandir: worked perfectly. Thank you!
[12:30] <amphi> HellDragon: strewth
[12:30] <PyroMithrandir> leojstewart, no problem :)
[12:30] <Nintendud> so, can anyone help me with my problem? after installing the 686 optimized kernel, mplayer and xmms only respond with a "segmentation fault" when I run them from the command line
[12:30] <eugman> dbcalo, Well I'm guessing you could do something with nautilus scripts and the cd command. Or copy the folder and then open a terminal and type cd and then paste the location into it but that's no fun.
[12:30] <Dr_Willis> darwin188,  sounds like you need to reconfigure your X server properly. perhaps install the nvidia or ati drivers. depending on your video card.
[12:30] <HellDragon> i dont know what to do now
[12:30] <HellDragon> i can only boot on a live cd
[12:30] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: they don't even give you any other output? :/
[12:31] <jlunder> Right, so I just put a new CD burner in this machine. It shows up in "Computer" but as a regular CD-ROM, and I can't burn anything through the nautilus interface. Is there some magic I need to invoke to get things working?
[12:31] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: nope
[12:31] <darwin188> but i dont even have a graphical interface
[12:31] <coucho> what's the disk info command again?
[12:31] <Nintendud> nintendud@johnspc:~$ mplayer
[12:31] <Nintendud> Segmentation fault
[12:31] <Nintendud> BAM
[12:31] <varunvarde2007> ok thanks everyone
[12:31] <Nintendud> same with xmms
[12:31] <varunvarde2007> maybe  iw ill come tomorrow for help
[12:31] <varunvarde2007> thakns
[12:31] <darwin188> how do i reconfigure the the xserver?
[12:31] <varunvarde2007> bye all
[12:31] <Nintendud> which is why I was so confused
[12:31] <Nintendud> ;p
[12:31] <Dr_Willis> !reconfigure
[12:31] <ubotu> I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Dr_Willis
[12:31] <Perkin> hello, i'm having a problem...
[12:31] <amphi> Nintendud: you could try running it under gdb and see if that gives you any idea
[12:31] <coucho> what's the disk info command again?
[12:31] <Dr_Willis> !fixres
[12:31] <ubotu> Help to fix the display resolution is available at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[12:31] <Nintendud> gdb?
[12:31] <Perkin> how can i manage the services of the system?
[12:31] <Nintendud> I've never heard of that
[12:31] <RandolphCarter> lol, I was just thinking that
[12:31] <RandolphCarter> it's the GNU Debugger
[12:31] <amphi> coucho: what disk info command? df ?
[12:31] <dbcalo> eugman, i'll keep looking into. i know last time i used linux there was a drop down menu it was in if you were looking at the contents a folder.
[12:32] <coucho> amphi: finally, thanks
[12:32] <tronus> i keep getting "error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0" whenever i run quake4 or, im assuming, any other program thats uses SDL.  I have it installed and linked in ld.so.conf and it still does it?
[12:32] <Old> how do i create a user with the permission like a root user? (ex i want the user: warlock to have full rights like a root user does)
[12:32] <AlwaysIcey> nelisa: I may have a workaround for you, although it's not a solution.
[12:32] <Nintendud> RandolphCarter: alright, I ran gdb, now what do I do? ;p
[12:32] <eugman> Old, may I ask why?
[12:32] <amphi> Nintendud: run mplayer under gdb, and when it crashes, do bt to get a stack trace, and see if you see anything enlightening
[12:32] <ompaul> !tell Old about root
[12:32] <amphi> Nintendud: are you using proprietary nvidia X drivers, BTW? ;)
[12:32] <RandolphCarter> Nintendud: you need to run 'gdb mplayer'
[12:32] <Madpilot> Old, your first user - the one you created during install - has full sudo privs - you can give any subsequently created users the same
[12:32] <Old> eugman, im installing webmin, and it needs a account to start my gameservers, i dont want to use the root account
[12:33] <lumpster> i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
[12:33] <RandolphCarter> then type 'run' and wait for a crash
[12:33] <Nintendud> amphi: if you mean if I'm using "nvidia" instead of "nv", then yes
[12:33] <Old> I only created 'root' there :-(
[12:33] <RandolphCarter> (press return too)
[12:33] <ruchbah> helldragon .. I've had problems with grub which I solved by booting a live cd then going into the /bin (? /usr/bin ?) of the hd install and running grub-install from there.  There was more to it than that, but that was the gist.  Does that sound like something to explore for your situation?
[12:33] <ompaul> Old, no it does not - this is ubuntu
[12:33] <Madpilot> Old, read the webmin page on the Ubuntu wiki
[12:33] <Perkin> sorry, i'm trying to manage the services of ubuntu, how can i do that?
[12:33] <Nintendud> I need nvidia for dual screens
[12:33] <amphi> Nintendud: you can do 'file /usr/bin/mplayer' at the gdb prompt, and then 'run'
[12:33] <Old> ompaul, huh?
[12:33] <ompaul> Old, read the web page that ubotu sent you as a message
[12:33] <AlwaysIcey> nelisa: If you go into System > Preferences > Assistive Technology Support, you can enable the magnifier and a few other options.  If nothing else, that will help until you get a solution.
[12:33] <Knorrie> Old: you do not want a web program to have root priviliges, webmin == evil
[12:33] <Old> disabling root account, I dont want that..
[12:33] <Old> oh
[12:33] <Old> but..
[12:33] <Dr_Willis> Perkin,  could read up on how the SysV init system works.. if thats what you are refering to.. theres also gui front ends to manage what gets started when.
[12:33] <Nintendud> amphi: did it, but uh... weird output o_O
[12:34] <Old> what user should i use then?!
[12:34] <ompaul> Old, no buts read the web page
[12:34] <amphi> Nintendud: that might be what's breaking mplayer and xmms - someone had a similar problem yesterday; you could check if using the nv driver makes the problem go away
[12:34] <Old> k, let me read it
[12:34] <Nintendud> amphi: I need dual monitors though!
[12:34] <Nintendud> :(
[12:34] <Nintendud> and, I believe nvidia is necessary for that, right? :P
[12:34] <Knorrie> Old: what's wrong with teh good old command line to start services?
[12:34] <Nintendud> I had no problem with the 386 kernel and nvidia
[12:34] <amphi> Nintendud: *shrug* - trying with nv would at least show if that was the cause of the proble,
[12:34] <Nintendud> it's just this one
[12:34] <Nintendud> :/
[12:34] <maike-maus> hello. can anybody help me getting my network / internet working?
[12:34] <amphi> er, problem
[12:35] <Nintendud> alright, I'll try it
[12:35] <Nintendud> hold on, editing xorg config
[12:35] <vlad> !commands
[12:35] <coucho> is there anyone in here who can help me with vnc server?
[12:35] <ubotu> from memory, commands is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands or http://www.linuxcommand.org/
[12:35] <Perkin> Dr_Willis: i saw that i can manage the main services, like schedules, with something called gnome-services or similar. do you know that?
[12:35] <Old> Knorrie, im new to ubuntu, mind explaining a little more ?
[12:35] <Nintendud> or should I show you gdb's output first, amphi ?
[12:35] <Old> I always use the root account, I dont dare to disable it
[12:35] <Knorrie> maike-maus: you're on irc without a network connection? :P
[12:35] <Dr_Willis> Perkin,  im old skool and normally twiddle the rc.d links myself.
[12:35] <amphi> Nintendud: did mplayer crash>
[12:35] <amphi> ?
[12:35] <redguy> Old: that is not very wise
[12:35] <darwin188> how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
[12:35] <Nintendud> amphi: um, gdb says: Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[12:35] <eugman> Old, In ubuntu root isn't used. Sudo is used before root level commands.

[12:36] <HellDragon> grub-install doesnt work
[12:36] <coucho> darwin188: they already told you to reconfigure your xserver
[12:36] <HellDragon> i need to add an option after
[12:36] <ompaul> Old, please read it again

[12:36] <HellDragon> wtf with all the spam
[12:36] <amphi> !pastebin
[12:36] <ubotu> it has been said that pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
[12:36] <Old> I dont feel like reading a story about some people swearing to each other Knorrie.
[12:36] <Knorrie> Old: bofh is fun
[12:36] <Nintendud> ah, I was wondering what that was
[12:36] <Knorrie> Old: but anyway..
[12:36] <darwin188> yes but how do i do that
[12:37] <Old> No, Im christian. I dont see those things being 'fun' to me. - sorry.
[12:37] <HellDragon> spam spam spam
[12:37] <Knorrie> Old: heh i'm too
[12:37] <amphi> Nintendud: pastebin it and paste the url in here - is there an openGL line near the top of the bt?
[12:37] <Old> Let me read it ompaul
[12:37] <Old> again.
[12:37] <coucho> darwin188: did you look through the manual yet?
[12:37] <RandolphCarter> bofh isn't really swearing :/
[12:37] <darwin188> i dont have a manual
[12:37] <Nintendud> amphi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14418
[12:37] <darwin188> i jsut have a cd
[12:37] <HellDragon> tpektoerjtre9j
[12:37] <Nintendud> amphi: that contains the error messages from run too
[12:37] <ompaul> Old, read that web page again, running as root is bad, it opens you to attacks in individual clients and gives too much power to applications that should not be trusted
[12:37] <nelisa> AlwaysIcey, upping the fonts helped loads
[12:38] <AlwaysIcey> Glad to hear that nelisa :D
[12:38] <nelisa> question 2, whay are there black borders on the screen?
[12:38] <Nintendud> amphi: it says glXChannelRectSyncSGIX ;p
[12:38] <amphi> Nintendud: yeah, looks like the same problem - $SMALL_SUM says switching to the nv xorg driver will make this problem go away
[12:38] <Old> Alright ompaul, Like im said. Im new to ubuntu and im trying to run applications as easy as possible, and as smoothly as possible. I'm not much of a googler to look for ways to get around not-using root.
[12:38] <coucho> darwin188: help.ubuntu.com / wiki.ubuntu.com
[12:38] <AlwaysIcey> I'm not sure about that at all.  Maybe someone else can answer it.
[12:38] <Nintendud> amphi: but, how will I use dual monitors?
[12:38] <darwin188> i already tried that not a lot of help
[12:39] <Nintendud> I don't think there is a way to do that under nv
[12:39] <darwin188> refers to this channel
[12:39] <Perkin> ok, i'll see in another way
[12:39] <Knorrie> Old: what gameservers are you running.. just curious :)
[12:39] <amphi> Nintendud: no idea - perhaps reinstalling the nvidia driver will fix it, dunno; it'd be worth checking that the problem goes away with the nv driver, as I grow weary of saying
[12:39] <Nintendud> alright, I'll check that first
[12:39] <Nintendud> I'll be back
[12:40] <Old> Knorrie, counter-strike servers, I work for alot of companies, and communitys. I know the basic in ubuntu to run game-servers, but im interested im learning more so i can do more with my game-servers.
[12:40] <ompaul> Old, that page says use sudo, if you want to install something it asks you for your password that is all, no one can brute force your root account that way, I could stay here all night doing one liners, take it as read it is a bad idea, or research it on ww.securityfocus.com
[12:40] <Old> well, brute forcing my password is impossible.
[12:40] <coucho> darwin188: k wait a second
[12:41] <Knorrie> Old: sorry to ask, but why do you complain about a sarcastic sysadmin story, and run games where people shoot each other, i dont get it
[12:41] <ompaul> Old, if the machine is compromised through the game server you will have only yourself to blame for running it as root, and personally I think you should go and do some research to understand what is wrong with running applicaitons as root
[12:41] <darwin188> thanks
[12:41] <Dr_Willis> games where people talk and help each other are too much  like IRC :P
[12:41] <Knorrie> Dr_Willis: heh
[12:42] <dgl> hi people, what is more secure way to set up an subversion server? Inetd or an script that initialize it on booting time?
[12:42] <lumpster> i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
[12:42] <ompaul> Dr_Willis, can we quote you on that?
[12:42] <sybariten> what _is_ a subversion server ?
[12:42] <Dr_Willis> ompaul,  :P sure.. im allready on tht bash.org site a few times
[12:42] <Knorrie> dgl: i use subversion and apache2 with the subversion-module
[12:42] <Old> Knorrie, I'm sorry to answer your questiong and you wasting my time litterly when im busy trying to sort out webmin. I have a son playing this game, And this is what i litterly do for a living. If you feel that what I'm doing is wrong, can you please me a work, as i cant seem to find any. Didn't really do good in school.
[12:42] <lumpster> sybariten: cvs..

[12:42] <Knorrie> Old: no offence
[12:43] <Old> Dont.. please
[12:43] <dell500> RandolphCarter and coucho, thanks for the help... btw, if you have a USB hd, you can ghost the image over to the usb from the raid0 array, right?
[12:43] <sybariten> hm, nothing for a guy who hasnt learned to use cvs yet i guess
[12:43] <dgl> Knorrie, man, i will use lighttpd and I know that there is a way to do something like it with lighttpd
[12:43] <coucho> dell500: that should be the case

[12:43] <coucho> dell500: as long as it's been allocated
[12:43] <coucho> dell500: you're welcome btw
[12:43] <Old> Im not having an attitude, but I'm really having it tough finding a work, And i get paid for this. As long as i get paid i do whatever it takes so get money so i can make a living.
[12:43] <sybariten> ompaul: that much i know
[12:43] <dell500> k... is there any other ghost image creators out there besides norton?
[12:43] <RandolphCarter> dell500: aye, good luck
[12:43] <dell500> thanks :)
[12:43] <bobbyd> Old, it's literally...
[12:43] <RandolphCarter> dell500: nope, ghost's proprietary
[12:44] <amphi> Old: your blood pressure... ;)
[12:44] <RandolphCarter> dell500: I'm not sure how easy it'd be to ghost onto a USB drive

[12:46] <jonuk> Hey everyone.  I'm very new to Ubuntu, and just now got it installed on my computer.  I installed it on a 250GB hard drive.  I gave 10GB to /root 20GB to /home and 1GB to /swap (i know thats a lot).  I ran into problems when trying to format the remaining 219 GB as FAT32, so I just left it as free space.  Now I want to format it so that I can share files between Linux and Windows.  What's the best way to create this partition?
[12:46] <dell500> 2005 is 9.0, so i think 2006 is 10.
[12:46] <RandolphCarter> Knorrie: aye, what's so bad about ssh?
[12:46] <HellDragon> can anyone help me :(
[12:46] <Old> ompaul, I created a user, and gave it a password. Is that all?
[12:46] <Knorrie> RandolphCarter: ssh isn't bad, did i say that?
=== subsinker is now known as sub|at|alpopel
[12:46] <spacey> jonuk: 219GB is way to big for fat32
[12:46] <amphi> jonuk: cfdisk is pretty easy
[12:46] <RandolphCarter> nope, kinda agreeing and diss'ing webmin for being pointless
[12:46] <Knorrie> !comfort ompaul
[12:46] <ubotu> I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Knorrie
[12:46] <ompaul> Old, that is all there is too it, if you need to run a command in a terminal, sudo command and it asks for your password
[12:46] <coucho> RandolphCarter: true, but i believe that it works after the usb driver has been loaded
[12:47] <HellDragon> :((((((((((((((
[12:47] <Old> Or should i disable the root usage aswell, If so. Is this user account i created -safe- to use for my gameservers and my webserver, so i can administrate them?
[12:47] <eugman> +p isn't the limit for fat around 137 gb?
[12:47] <RandolphCarter> coucho: yeah, it should
[12:47] <Briguy> I have two cdrom drives installed, where can I find what they're known as?

[12:47] <Old> ompaul, so when i login with putty i will be using my new account i created instead of root in the future?

[12:48] <jonuk> so I can use CDISK to make partitions?
[12:48] <RandolphCarter> Old: you can always fix it by chrooting in from a livecd
[12:48] <buzzed> any thoughts on running ubuntu on a T43p Thinkpad?
[12:48] <Knorrie> dgl: i'm running a dedicated apache2 install somewhere to server subversion repo's, just because the svn people made a apache-module like http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/libapache2-svn
[12:48] <HellDragon> im on a livecd
[12:48] <amphi> jonuk: cfdisk, yes
[12:48] <jonuk> spacey:  what's the standard size for a FAT32 partition?
[12:49] <Old> Ah, I know. But i have a few things todo on my spare time, and i dont feel like going down to the server just to fix that :-)
[12:49] <spacey> jonuk: maximum size you mean? i don't know, google it:)
[12:49] <ompaul> Old, if you gave root a password and installed software and let it run as root all bets are off its reinstall time sorry but that is how I view it
[12:49] <amphi> jonuk: 1.44 MB ;)
[12:49] <HellDragon> kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
[12:49] <jonuk> maximmum size, yes
[12:49] <ompaul> HellDragon, what?
[12:49] <RandolphCarter> jonuk: the max FAT32 partition size is 2TiB

[12:50] <jonuk> i can format it in either linux or windows

[12:51] <HellDragon> how can you dont panic with all the spam
[12:51] <HellDragon> ook
[12:51] <RandolphCarter> well, windows won't like formatting a large drive, but mkdosfs /dev/*drive**partition* should work
[12:51] <amphi> HellDragon: spam?
[12:51] <HellDragon> nothing
[12:51] <HellDragon> fdisk -l /dev/hda says nothing
[12:51] <RandolphCarter> oh, sudo mkdosfs..
[12:51] <jonuk> well, how about this
[12:51] <ompaul> Old, the page tells you how to, however if a program is running as root one of these game servers your talking about then *all bets are off* the risk of a compromise is too high
[12:51] <ompaul> Old, and with that I am gone, good night.
[12:51] <ruchbah> Knorrie HellDragon -- I've done that for a similar thing.  Had ubuntu on hd and booted dsl.  Mounted.  Ran grub-install.

[12:52] <amphi> HellDragon: sata hd?
[12:52] <Old> Oh well, Is there a high risc of people hacking theirselfs into my system?
[12:52] <jonuk> I'll make a 20GB FAT32 partition, to let me read/write files in either linux or windows.  Then I'll make the rest just NTFS, so I can at least read the files in Linux
[12:52] <hyphenated> RandolphCarter: he'll need -F 32 to get anything larger than 2GB or so
[12:52] <HellDragon> amphi: yes
[12:52] <RandolphCarter> hyphenated: it'll automagic that
[12:52] <amphi> HellDragon: now you say so...
[12:52] <Knorrie> Old: not even people, there are lots of automated botnets that try to do that all the time
[12:52] <RandolphCarter> ack, no it won't, you need -F 32 :( (my bad)

[12:55] <Old> woah - wait a second. Could someone take that again? Should i change the root pass to something hard (I'll write it down) to prevent brute forcing(?)
[12:56] <amphi> Nintendud: well, it would appear not to be your nvidia driver, so you can have your monitors back ;)
[12:56] <Nintendud> mugzie: yes, but that's irrelevant to my problem
[12:56] <Nintendud> amphi: yeah, but.. now what?
[12:56] <mugzie> why
[12:56] <amphi> HellDragon: ls mnt shows you files and directories ?
[12:56] <HellDragon> yes
[12:56] <amphi> HellDragon: that's 'ls mnt'

[12:59] <amphi> HellDragon: /dev/sda8 ??
[01:00] <negman> coucho - what are the useful programs?  i've not even heard of it.
[01:00] <coucho> negman: harware testing tools, partitioning tools, backup tools, things like that
[01:00] <HellDragon> huh amphi ^
[01:00] <negman> gotcha
[01:00] <tronus> anyone know where i can find a 32bit libSDL-1.2.so.0 file?
[01:00] <MorbidHunger> can i have some help?
[01:00] <HellDragon> i dont have any sda8
[01:00] <coucho> negman: it's great, it'll really simplify any of that stuff if you have to do it

[01:05] <HellDragon> The file /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly.
[01:05] <HellDragon>  wtf is taht

[01:07] <breeden> I had synaptic already open, hopefully this should fix the problem
[01:08] <breeden> it worked, thanks alot :)

[01:12] <breeden> dgl, to my understanding xinetd is not backwards compatible with inetd...  It would require some manual tunning if you were planning on running a server that didn't support xinetd directly, I believe

[01:12] <coucho> lol
[01:12] <HellDragon> grub is dead!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAH!

[01:13] <maike-maus> soundray: yes, xserver working but network still down

[01:17] <soundray> maike-maus: I guess I've been really lucky with my Turion laptop from Aldi. Almost everything worked straight away, including the Xpress 200 graphics... I'll stay away from Packard Bell, that's for sure.
[01:18] <lss> Im really confused. I think i have got the driver now, and the drivers file name is "via-rhine.c" and I have no idea how to install it. Thanks
[01:18] <andrejkw> I might open a new site for Ubuntu Guides (Breezy and up), anyone have a suggestion for a name? I might also be looking for staff, anyone interested?

[01:20] <leojstewart> soundray: no, I'm pretty sure it's a bug.  Like half of the icon disappears, and randomly appears again ><
[01:20] <andrejkw> _antix: well I find it very disorganized and confusing for newcomers

[01:24] <nickrud> KenSentMe, try installing myspell-nl
[01:24] <linuxbomb> makelele, put it in blacklist
[01:25] <coucho> amphi: cause you helped me with it yesterday
[01:25] <amphi> coucho: with sendmail?
[01:25] <makelele> linuxbomb: how do i do that
[01:25] <coucho> amphi: ah wait, no you didn't, sorry
[01:25] <nickrud> er bimberi you're quick or I'm slow :)
[01:25] <linuxbomb> /etc/hotplug/blacklist
[01:25] <coucho> anyone familiar with sendmail in here?
[01:25] <amphi> coucho: ;) I use postfix
[01:25] <soundray> KenSentMe: you're right. The spellchecker is in myspell-nl
[01:26] <coucho> amphi: yeah i remember now :D
[01:26] <Briguy> how can I edit fstab? it's read only :-(
[01:26] <coucho> Briguy: use sudo
[01:26] <amphi> Briguy: sudo
[01:26] <KenSentMe> soundray: nickrud: bimberi: right, myspell is the one i was looking for. Thank you
[01:26] <linuxbomb> makelele, i normally just mv the module from /lib/modules/
[01:27] <CokeNCode> goodnight, is it possibly to use dialup and adsl at the same time, on the same computer with ubuntu to boost bandwidth ?
[01:27] <GatoLoko^> hi
=== blind|AFK is now known as blind
[01:27] <makelele> linuxbomb: thanks i will try that,although your second option sounds better, this ATI card is causing me grief
[01:27] <sflash> i wanted to share a folder using samba. I have a USB drive that mounted to a folder. For some reason when i share that folder, i cant get it access from a windows computer, any help?
[01:27] <coucho> k i'm getting a little pissed off now, can anyone please help me with sendmail?
[01:27] <bimberi> nickrud: i found my aussie spellchecking yesterday so knew where to look :)
[01:27] <MorbidHunger> what was that one command someone just gave me?
[01:27] <CokeNCode> coucho, what problem are you experiencing ?
[01:27] <coucho> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14419
[01:27] <coucho> thnx
[01:27] <linuxbomb> makelele, just do a search in /lib/modules and move it to somewhere and then it wont get loaded
[01:28] <Nintendud> this is weird.
[01:28] <MorbidHunger> how do i change video cards?
[01:29] <offby1> I'm using Dapper on a laptop, and every time I try to hibernate, it merely starts the screen saver.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this a known problem?
[01:29] <coucho> CokeNCode: i use postfix now, but it still seems to want to use sendmail
[01:29] <lss> can someone please help?? need to install my lan card. I've got the correct driver, but don't understand the instructions
[01:29] <Nintendud> I rebooted into 386 kernel, mplayer and xmms worked, uninstalled the 686 kernel, rebooted, and now segmentation fault again
[01:29] <Nintendud> this is really pissing me off >_<
[01:29] <makelele> linuxbomb:thanks ,one more thing ,do you know what the modass dir is all about ?
[01:29] <MorbidHunger> im getting pissed too
[01:29] <Nintendud> I can't win :(
[01:29] <coucho> let's all get pissed :P
[01:29] <nickrud> MorbidHunger, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:29] <Knorrie> looks like everyone is pissing here at the moment
[01:29] <Knorrie> \o/
[01:30] <MorbidHunger> does the xerver has to be running?
[01:30] <CokeNCode> coucho, apt-get install sendmail
[01:30] <coucho> no they're gtting pissed
[01:30] <CokeNCode> the package handler will pretty much do the job for you
[01:30] <linuxbomb> makelele, no idea , but check out modconf utility
[01:30] <coucho> CokeNCode: i don't want to install sendmail, i just got rid of it XD
[01:30] <Nintendud> I seriously don't understand what's happening
[01:30] <CokeNCode> now, to my problem folks ... does anyone know if i can use adsl and dialup at the same time
[01:30] <bung> yes
[01:30] <MorbidHunger> and would it conflict with my onbored video?
[01:30] <amphi> Nintendud: your ram might be marginal?
[01:31] <Knorrie> Nintendud: mplayer has optimized packages for 386, 686 etc... is the right one installed?
[01:31] <CokeNCode> oh, sorry coucho ... right now i'm supposed to have a 512 connection, and i'm connecting at 18 and below ... so i'm a bit distracted ... :/
[01:31] <Nintendud> Knorrie: I compiled it myself, and it worked before.
[01:31] <GatoLoko^> is there a way to see "extra messages" from xorg? i'm having problems (lockups) and the log files don't show nothing
[01:31] <Nintendud> amphi: I have 384 megs of RAM and I'm running XFCE4
[01:31] <Briguy> this is a retarded question but how do you save an opened vim document via console?
[01:31] <coucho> CokeNCode: that's ok, i understand, that's very f'ing frustrating
[01:31] <MorbidHunger> i have 256 sd
[01:31] <Nintendud> everything worked fine before that damned 686 optimized kernel
[01:31] <Knorrie> Nintendud: don't complain @ ubuntu if you compile yourself ;)
[01:31] <Nintendud> Knorrie: xmms doesn't work either
[01:32] <Nintendud> and that wasn't compiled by me
[01:32] <MorbidHunger> a smoking ati rage lt pro onbored video
[01:32] <Nintendud> :P
[01:32] <amphi> Nintendud: I meant is it dodgy - it might be worth trying memtest86
[01:32] <coucho> Briguy: use nano man, much better
[01:32] <Nintendud> amphi: no.
[01:32] <Nintendud> :P
[01:32] <Nintendud> I seriously doubt it's a RAM issue
[01:32] <amphi> Nintendud: me too, just fumbling for a straw ;)
[01:32] <Knorrie> Briguy: ESC :wq
[01:32] <Nintendud> like I said, it worked when I booted into the 386 kernel, but once I uninstalled the 686 kernel and rebooted... segmentation fault again
[01:33] <MorbidHunger> if i reconfigure the x server does it have to be running
[01:33] <KenSentMe> I've added a Samba share to my desktop so i can copy files to and from it. Why don't those network connections work when i use the 'browse'  function on websites in Firefox?
[01:33] <amphi> Nintendud: but that it worked with the 386 kernel while the 686 one was installed, but not when the 686 was uninstalled makes no sense at all
[01:33] <Nintendud> amphi: I know.
[01:33] <coucho> MorbidHunger: probably not, maybe it even needs to not run
[01:33] <MorbidHunger> i ran it while it was running
[01:33] <amphi> Nintendud: so don't muddy the waters ;)
[01:34] <MorbidHunger> but when i put the s3trio in the server bitches at me and wont run
[01:34] <MorbidHunger> is it cuz i have onbored video?
[01:34] <Nintendud> amphi: it might make more sense if I told you that everytime I booted into a different kernel, X would crash on boot and I had to apt-get install and remove nvidia-glx-dev before it would run, and it would continue to work correctly every time I rebooted until I use a different kernel
[01:34] <Nintendud> er, apt-get remove and install*
[01:34] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: a server? video? does a server need a video card?
[01:34] <MorbidHunger> dont think so
[01:35] <MorbidHunger> but it wont run
[01:35] <MorbidHunger> whichj puzzles me
[01:35] <Nintendud> (might have to do with "nvidia TLS links", since whenever I install it it updates the "nvidia TLS links"
[01:35] <Nintendud> )
[01:35] <DewDude> any idea why hibernate stopped working in Dapper, it just restarts the system now.
[01:35] <Nintendud> arr, this is weird
[01:35] <amphi> Nintendud: that's part of the fun of proprietary drivers I believe; just pick a kernel and stick to it, is my advice ;)
[01:36] <coucho> what's a s3trio? or is that a really dumb question?
[01:36] <Knorrie> DewDude: hibernate sounds like suspend to disk... and yeah.. network connections will be lost
[01:36] <Nintendud> amphi: well, I still don't know how to fix this. and it's really frustrating me.
[01:36] <DewDude> i'm not talking network connections
[01:36] <MorbidHunger> this video card i found laying around at school
[01:36] <DewDude> i know they get lost
[01:36] <Knorrie> coucho: some video card chip
[01:36] <coucho> lol k
[01:36] <amphi> coucho: an antique ;)
[01:36] <coucho> heheh
[01:36] <DewDude> i'm taking about rather than restoring after syuspend, it just restarts
[01:36] <MorbidHunger> i just cant get it to work with ubuntu
[01:36] <MorbidHunger> it is very old
[01:37] <DewDude> cuz i pretty much stopped all my apps that use networking before i hit hibernate
[01:37] <amphi> Nintendud: pick a kernel, and reinstall all the nvidia packages I'd guess
[01:37] <MorbidHunger> my athlon xp died and im stuck on this peece of shit from hell
[01:37] <Nintendud> hmm
[01:37] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: why wont the onboard card work?
[01:37] <coucho> MorbidHunger: i would suggest buying a geforce 4 or something, costs nothing and will work
[01:37] <Nintendud> well, I'm only using the 386 kernel now
[01:38] <MorbidHunger> it does work jsut horrible
[01:38] <MorbidHunger> i dont have an agp slot on this mobo
[01:38] <DewDude> ...oh..wait...would suspend to disk be dependant on the kernal image you were using?
[01:38] <jadaz87> hello does anyone know a good APACHE-MYSQL-PHP for ubuntu?
[01:38] <nickrud> MorbidHunger, you need to run the reconfigure command after putting in the new card (sorry if you have, I was awy for a sec)
[01:38] <coucho> MorbidHunger: i've got a mx420 and it works perfectly, and it probably exists as pci card too
[01:38] <amphi> DewDude: this is using swsusp?
[01:38] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: if it's meant to be a server... an utp cable is more important than vga :P
[01:39] <DewDude> umm...i'm hitting hibernate from the log off menu
[01:39] <DewDude> it's worked before
[01:39] <MorbidHunger> heh
[01:39] <MorbidHunger> meh
[01:39] <coucho> Knorrie: you dutch btw?
[01:39] <Knorrie> coucho: yes
[01:39] <coucho> ah
[01:39] <MorbidHunger> ubuntu doesnt even detect my onbored audio
[01:39] <coucho> m2
[01:39] <MorbidHunger> i dont have a fan or a heatsink either
[01:39] <DewDude> however, when i was using the wifi earlier, i was using my 386  kernal rather than the 686 because my wifi tends to lock the 686 kernel up
[01:39] <Knorrie> coucho: i saw you using paste.ubuntunl ;p
[01:39] <coucho> XD
[01:39] <amphi> DewDude: it might be that you need to boot with restore=/dev/foo where /dev/foo is your swap partition, for it to work
[01:39] <Evanescent> um hello
[01:40] <Knorrie> Evanescent: hi
[01:40] <MorbidHunger> its amazing this thing works
[01:40] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: lol
[01:40] <MorbidHunger> i should send ug uys pics later
[01:40] <DewDude> heh, well, if it's using disk swap, it's probablty already overwritten the session
[01:40] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: lol @ onbored audio
[01:40] <MorbidHunger> yeah
[01:40] <Knorrie> :D
[01:40] <Evanescent> this is where i make myself look really stupid
[01:40] <MorbidHunger> ill see if i can get a sound card tomroww
[01:40] <amphi> DewDude: er, s/restore/resume
[01:40] <DewDude> MorbidHunger, that's a shame because ubuntu worked on all my hardware
[01:40] <Knorrie> Evanescent: you're not stupid
[01:40] <coucho> MorbidHunger: you do that
[01:40] <DewDude> only thing i can't get running is 3d on my laptop
[01:40] <MorbidHunger> its cuz im on a compaq and my karma sucks
[01:40] <amphi> DewDude: and yes, a normal boot will obliterate the session
[01:41] <Knorrie> !MorbidHunger++
[01:41] <Evanescent> can someone tell me how to install ubuntu as a dual boot with 2kpro?
[01:41] <dominion> Morbid fact: On June 29, 1955, the reign of King Haakon VII, who had ruled Norway from the time of its independence in 1905, effectively came to an end when the beloved monarch fell in the royal bathtub at his palace in Oslo. The elderly king lingered on for over two years before succumbing on Setpember 21, 1957, to complications resulting from his fall.
[01:41] <DewDude> amphi: alrighty then, no real big loss
[01:41] <MorbidHunger> this is horrible guys
[01:41] <DewDude> it had worked before..i'll ahve to play with it a bit
[01:41] <Nintendud> HOLY CRAP
[01:41] <Knorrie> Evanescent: first install 2k, then install ubuntu
[01:41] <Nintendud> amphi: reinstalling nvidia stuff and everything worked
[01:41] <amphi> dominion: whiskey tango foxtrot?
[01:41] <Nintendud> I don't even have to reboot
[01:41] <DewDude> my laptop lacks battery, so, if i take it anywhere, i like to sysuspend to disk so i don't have to wait for the boot process
[01:41] <leojstewart> Does anybody else have problems with Gmail-Notify?
[01:42] <amphi> DewDude: yeah, I use swsusp a lot
[01:42] <cocox> wish application could you recommend me for partitioning my disk????
[01:42] <Nintendud> thank you amphi. makes me wonder if I could reinstall the 686 kernel and reinstall nvidia things to get it to work. ;p but I am not doing that today
[01:42] <MorbidHunger> ok but will the s3trio conflict with the onbored video?
[01:42] <Knorrie> Evanescent: the ubuntu installer will overwrite the boot record with a boot-loader, and present w2k and ubuntu choice
[01:42] <Nintendud> thanks for the help and patience
[01:42] <amphi> DewDude: no need to reboot, evar ;)
[01:42] <coucho> cocox: partition magic
[01:42] <rab> whats the command to display system information
[01:42] <cocox> coucho, for linux ?
[01:42] <amphi> coucho: no
[01:42] <coucho> XD
[01:42] <coucho> just kidding
[01:42] <coucho> sry
[01:42] <DewDude> amphi: yeah, i think my problem was i didn't specify the kernel i suspended with, because i think my ndiswrapper conflicts with 686
[01:43] <Khoacalacan> Can anyone help me please? I have this error message after.....

[01:43] <Knorrie> Evanescent: whenever 'repairing' w2k or reinstalling w2k, the windows installer breaks your system
[01:43] <Evanescent> Knorrie: yeah i've already got 2kpro installed i'm just not sure how to go about installing ubuntu. i downloaded the iso, opened it with undisker and burnt the files to a data disc but it's not bootable
[01:43] <MorbidHunger> Khoacalacan. thats the same shit i got
[01:43] <DewDude> heh
[01:43] <Khoacalacan> Dam anyone know how to fix it???
[01:43] <DewDude> hey, i've like, installed linux, then installed XP, then fixed dual boot
[01:43] <DewDude> man, i had some fun with the MBR that day
[01:43] <MorbidHunger> install xp than linux
[01:43] <amphi> DewDude: yeah, it's not rocket surgery ;)
[01:44] <Knorrie> Evanescent: when you burn the iso to a cdrom it should be bootable
[01:44] <cocox> Khoacalacan, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=174537 read this at the end
[01:44] <Khoacalacan> Ok thank you
[01:44] <DewDude> amphi, dual-booting or my suspend issue
[01:44] <cocox> Khoacalacan, there is the solution
[01:44] <coucho> DewDude: that's not very wise
[01:44] <amphi> DewDude: dual booting
[01:44] <MorbidHunger> i should read that roo
[01:44] <MorbidHunger> too*
[01:44] <Khoacalacan> Thank you cocox
[01:44] <DewDude> coucho: i know. I learned my lesson when after resoring my MBR, my XP partition was gone.
[01:44] <cocox> Khoacalacan np :)
[01:44] <coucho> DewDude: ouch XD
[01:44] <DewDude> i was able to get that back by telling CFDisk to repartition
[01:44] <MorbidHunger> hooray for crappy hardware!!
[01:44] <DewDude> coucho: no, cfdisk fixed it in about 2 seconds
[01:45] <DewDude> it's been dual-booting ever since
[01:45] <amphi> DewDude: I imagine very Bad Things(TM) will happen if you boot a different kernel than you suspended with and manage to get the session to restore
[01:45] <coucho> DewDude: wow
[01:45] <DewDude> amphi, yeah, i totally forgot i had done that.
[01:45] <Evanescent> Knorrie: even after opening the iso file first?
[01:45] <coucho> DewDude: didn't think that was possible
[01:45] <DewDude> cuz i was about ready to throw this out a window earlier
[01:45] <DewDude> coucho: sure it is.
[01:45] <Knorrie> Evanescent: you dont need to open an iso, just burn it byte-by-byte to a cdrom
[01:46] <DewDude> i had a drive partition completely disappear once
[01:46] <Khoacalacan> Cocox: Is it near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
[01:46] <coucho> DewDude: doesn't the xp install completely overwrite the mbr?
[01:46] <vars> hey i am making a multimedia cd for windows and i want to make an icon for the launcher to launch    does anyone know how to do this?
[01:46] <cocox> amphi, what is the difference between qparted, cfdisk or gparted ??? can anybody please tell me wish one is the best ??
[01:46] <iguananed> hello all, just wondering if there is a way to test surround sound in ubuntu?
[01:46] <DewDude> coucho: yes, it does
[01:46] <DewDude> but..if you partition your drives out
[01:46] <coucho> DewDude: then what?
[01:46] <DewDude> back up the MBR, install windows, then restore the MBR, that CAN work
[01:46] <Knorrie> Evanescent: you're burning in windows?
[01:46] <DewDude> provided you don't backup before setting your partitions
[01:46] <Evanescent> Knorrie: ok i'll try it but if it desn't work i'll be back to haunt you...
[01:47] <Evanescent> yes
[01:47] <Knorrie> Evanescent: using what tool?
[01:47] <amphi> cocox: depends for what - one of the parteds if you need to resize some existing partition, otherwise cfdisk for just normally partitioning a disk; there's fdisk and sfdisk as well, but cfdisk is the simplest to use
[01:47] <Evanescent> nero
[01:47] <coucho> DewDude: so first install linux, backup mbr, install xp, replace mbr?
[01:47] <DewDude> coucho: that's one way of doing it IF you want to install linux before windows
[01:47] <Knorrie> Evanescent: nero should allow you to just 'burn cd image'
[01:47] <DewDude> but make sure you have EVERYTHING partitioned out
[01:47] <amphi> coucho: or just reinstall grub
[01:47] <DewDude> yeah
[01:47] <cocox> amphi, all those allow me to change mi partiotion size without erase my data ??
[01:47] <coucho> DewDude: yeah i just installed xp first, seemed easier XD
[01:48] <DewDude> you'll need a live or bootcd either way
[01:48] <Knorrie> Evanescent: i did that some long time ago when i had windows installed :P
[01:48] <Evanescent> yeah it's being awkward
[01:48] <Khoacalacan> Cocox: Is solution near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
[01:48] <Falstius> my nfs mount stopped working.  I didn't change anything, but now I get the message "mount: box:/media/jakarta failed, reason given by server: Permission denied" .. there's nothing in the server or client /var/log/messages and the exports allows 192.168.* ... any suggestions of where I could look now?
[01:48] <MorbidHunger> im so screwed
[01:48] <cocox> Khoacalacan, lol just the last post
[01:48] <Evanescent> ok i'll try it anyway, thanks for now
[01:48] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: get some decent hardware
[01:48] <Khoacalacan> oh I was reading the whole thing XD
[01:48] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: sorry :P
[01:48] <amphi> coucho: the parteds are for that as I said; I've succesfully resized an ntfs partition once for someone with a parted; better to back up before messing with partitions generally, IMHO
[01:48] <DewDude> Falstius, did you check your /etc/fstab?
[01:48] <MorbidHunger> i need to buy a mobo
[01:49] <MorbidHunger> i dont have 60 bucks
[01:49] <cocox> Khoacalacan, excuse me the one before the last post
[01:49] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: student life is hard
[01:49] <MorbidHunger> yeah
[01:49] <DewDude> or...wait..is the NFTS drive in your local machine or are you doing it over LAN using Samba?
[01:49] <MorbidHunger> espically when im busy fixing everyone else stuff
[01:49] <MorbidHunger> and than they bitch about the free work i did
[01:49] <Khoacalacan> Arghhhh
[01:49] <Falstius> DewDude: I can't mount it from the command line either ...
[01:49] <MorbidHunger> meh sorry for the rant
[01:50] <coucho> MorbidHunger: just buy asrock or something, that oughtta be less than 60 bucks
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> ttyl guys
[01:50] <coucho> later
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> mom finished dinner
[01:50] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: have fun cu later
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> yeah im sure i cna buy one for less
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> but not one id be happy with
[01:50] <DewDude> Falstius: answer my question about the location of the NTFS drive
[01:50] <coucho> true
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> ttyl guys
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> thanx for the help
[01:50] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: my current server is a PII233
[01:50] <DewDude> 233?
[01:50] <MorbidHunger> im on a 450 k6-2
[01:50] <DewDude> heh, my server is a 400mhz PowerPC
[01:50] <amphi> MorbidHunger: so quit yer bitching ;)
[01:50] <coucho> mine is a p4 2.4, i know, overkill XD
[01:50] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: so DONT COMPLAIN :DDD
[01:51] <MorbidHunger> im not bitched about the cpu
[01:51] <Knorrie> ghehehe
[01:51] <Falstius> DewDude: a simple mount "box:/media /media" gives me that error.  This is NFS, not NTFS.
[01:51] <MorbidHunger> just the video
[01:51] <Knorrie> MorbidHunger: serial console rocks
[01:51] <amphi> MorbidHunger: it can't do 80x25 console?
[01:51] <DewDude> oh, nfs
[01:51] <DewDude> i'm dyslexic
[01:51] <coucho> CPU: AMD Athlon 64 3500+
[01:51] <Falstius> no worries.
[01:51] <coucho> ow wait, wrong one
[01:51] <DewDude> doesn't help when trying to learn linux
[01:52] <DewDude> umm...i don't really know...everytime i've done anything with NFS, i've had to use a howto
[01:52] <Old> where do you put .sh files?
[01:52] <DewDude> like, i got samba commands memorized
[01:52] <Old> Anyone know where to put my .sh files?
[01:52] <Falstius> ahh, I'm the opposite.  Normally I can just do nfs, but I have to look up anything to do with samba.
[01:52] <vars> hey i ahve a cd-wr what should my fstab permissions be?
[01:52] <Knorrie> Old: ~/bin
[01:53] <Old> just in /bin ?
[01:53] <Old> k

[01:56] <Old> you click the "stop server" button, and it exectues stop.sh
[01:56] <Knorrie> coucho: irssi split screen sucks
[01:56] <ruchbah_> !paste
[01:56] <ubotu> Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
[01:57] <coucho> Knorrie: how's that?
[01:57] <vars> hmm i don't know
[01:57] <Old> one second, dont say anything, I think i found the problem. (Getting late :-(
[01:57] <coucho> Knorrie: oh wait, command line interface right?
[01:57] <amphi> Old: dunno about webmin, but you might want to specify the absolute path to stop.sh
[01:58] <amphi> Knorrie: so don't do that then ;)
[01:58] <tberg> can someone tell me how to play MIDIs on ubuntu
[01:58] <ruchbah_> darwn188 give me a sec, I'll see if I can help

[02:03] <darwin188> where?
[02:03] <amphi> Old: why don't you just make a proper init script for it?
[02:04] <tommy_> i d like to know if someone knows a way to revert a "rm" command ?
[02:04] <Old> how do you mean ?
[02:04] <ruchbah_> darwin188 - sorry /etc/X11/XF86config
[02:04] <coucho> Knorrie: is there some sort of xthingy viewer for windows?
[02:04] <tommy_> is there a kind of trash when we use rm ?
[02:04] <amphi> Old: like the ones in /etc/init.d
[02:04] <amphi> tommy_: no undelete on ext3

[02:06] <darwin188> no such file or directory, hey but i installed the powerpc version
[02:06] <Old> /home/cs/warservers/speedlink <- that dir, the stop.sh works
[02:06] <amphi> Old: in what dir?
[02:06] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  you'r on a ppc
[02:06] <darwin188> yes
[02:06] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  you're on a ppc?
[02:06] <leojstewart> My system often freezes when I exit Azureus
[02:07] <amphi> Old: but that's probably not webmin's CWD
[02:07] <leojstewart> does anyone know why?
[02:07] <Old> huh?
[02:07] <Old> root@server:/home/cs/warservers/speedlink# ./start.sh

[02:08] <jadaz87> not*
[02:08] <darwin188> yes i am on a ppc
[02:08] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  you out there?
[02:08] <lufis> How do I get tar to extract to a certain directory?
[02:08] <Madpilot> jadaz87, it is
[02:08] <darwin188> yes i am
[02:08] <Madpilot> !info webmin
[02:08] <darwin188> i am here

[02:08] <amphi> lufis: man tar ;)
[02:08] <Madpilot> jadaz87, it's in Universe
[02:08] <lufis> amphi, ;)
[02:08] <darwin188> ping ruchbah_
[02:08] <jadaz87> Madpilot: i have both universe and multiverse enabled
[02:08] <amphi> lufis: I commend -C to your attention ;)
[02:08] <Old> amphi, any ideas why i get that error? I cant seem to understand it
[02:08] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  ok, there is a ppc channel #ubuntu-ppc (I think)
[02:09] <darwin188> okey
[02:09] <lufis> Ampi: alright, thank you
[02:09] <Madpilot> jadaz87, you running Breezy or Dapper?
[02:09] <darwin188> but it shouldnt be different
[02:09] <lufis> amphi&
[02:09] <darwin188> i think
[02:09] <jadaz87> Madpilot: dapper
[02:09] <darwin188> believe
[02:09] <Madpilot> jadaz87, I read somewhere that webmin has been dropped completely from Dapper
[02:09] <jadaz87> NOO!!! :-(
[02:09] <jadaz87> Madpilot: why?
[02:09] <amphi> Old: the error is clear - no script called stop.sh in CWD
[02:09] <jadaz87> Madpilot: can i install the one from breezy?
[02:10] <Zizou> Hi, does any body knows how to change the totem video output? i install xgl, the videos are really slow, I think I have to change it to gl or gl2...
[02:10] <Old> CWD?
[02:10] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  but try this command befor you go there > 'cat /etc/X11/FX86' but hit tab before enter and let it auto compleate
[02:10] <amphi> Old: current working directory
[02:10] <Madpilot> ruchbah_, there is no channel #ubuntu-ppc
[02:10] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -  what do you get?
[02:10] <Madpilot> jadaz87, no idea, on either of your questions
[02:10] <leojstewart> Why is it that with the 'Weather Report' that when I click Update, it seems to update, but the 'Last Update' says a time of twenty or so minutes ago?
[02:10] <Old> hmpfh
[02:10] <amphi> Old: because the cd command failed
[02:10] <amphi> from your paste above
[02:10] <leojstewart> Does anyone know?
[02:11] <Madpilot> leojstewart, the weather only updates once an hour or so - it's from the US Weather Service website
[02:11] <shinu> anyone could tell me how to force framebuffer to use a i810 driver instead of the vesa one?
[02:11] <ruchbah_> Madpilot - any where else he should check for ppc specific stuff?
[02:11] <leojstewart> Oh, I thought it was from Weather.com
[02:11] <leojstewart> thanks, Madpilot
[02:11] <Old> gonna try something else, one sec
[02:12] <Madpilot> ruchbah_, no - but there are Ubuntu_PPC users here...
[02:12] <ruchbah_> ok
[02:12] <leojstewart> is there any way to make it update from a different website which updates more fequently?
[02:12] <amphi> shinu: console fb?
[02:12] <nelisa> Madpilot, I;m trying to plug my ipaq
[02:12] <Madpilot> leojstewart, it's an open source app, so probably ;)

[02:16] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- just a sec
[02:17] <Zizou> keithsr: ok... you have to use smbpasswd "user"
[02:17] <darwin188> ok
[02:17] <spanglesontoast> does anyone know how to get files within a directory using wget
[02:17] <Zizou> keithsr: user is an actual user of the ubuntu server...
[02:17] <spanglesontoast> ?
[02:17] <Khoacalacan> I have two(2) hard drives and it only shows one hard drive on my computer, How do I make the second one show?
[02:17] <sflash> ok, i just want to run this app that i downloaded bittornado. but the icon doesnt exist in my applications menu on top
[02:17] <bimberi> leojstewart: System -> Preferences -> Sessions, Startup Programs
[02:17] <sflash> do i have to add it manually?
[02:17] <leojstewart> bimberl: Thanks :)
[02:17] <keithsr> i have tried that but it is not working
[02:18] <bimberi> leojstewart: np :)
[02:18] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- how about xorg.conf?
[02:18] <Zizou> keithsr: how is that? is the only way
[02:18] <bimberi> sflash: probably, some packages don't create menu entries :|  right-click on the Applications Menu and select Edit Menus
[02:18] <unperson> What sort of "extention" does a printer driver file usually have?
[02:18] <adrums20> I am having issues with logging in as ROOT - I have tried the su passwd root and still no go.. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday
[02:19] <amy_> hey
[02:19] <Zizou> keithsr: if you have an user "zizou" in the ubuntu server
[02:19] <unperson> adrums20: You mean sudo passwd root, right?
[02:19] <Zizou> keithsr: you do smbpasswd zizou
[02:19] <adrums20> yes
[02:19] <bimberi> keithsr: is this samba?  if so samba has its own password list - "sudo smbpasswd -a username"
[02:20] <unperson> adrums20: What happened when you tried that?
[02:20] <Zizou> keithsr: then when youre accesing the ubuntu server you type the user zizou and the password you asinght it..
[02:20] <adrums20> let me try bud
[02:21] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- breaker breaker
[02:21] <darwin188> heh?
[02:21] <darwin188> i am still here
[02:21] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- how about /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[02:21] <Zizou> keithsr: try with the same password that is in the linux acount
[02:21] <darwin188> yes
[02:21] <darwin188> i have it
[02:21] <keithsr> yes samba...ihave done that
[02:22] <unperson> Any extensions other than .ppd for printer driver files?  Anyone?
[02:22] <darwin188> rachbah_ : still holding
[02:22] <adrums20> it asks for the password and then I type it in. and back to the prompt it goes
[02:22] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- can you post it on http://paste-ubuntu.nl.org?
[02:22] <darwin188> what shhould i post?
[02:22] <darwin188> the problem is that i am on my laptop and i am installing linux on another computer
[02:23] <adrums20> lat2bt
[02:23] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- ok, ok, let me see ....
[02:23] <unperson> adrums20: So it doesn't say "Password updated succesfully"?
[02:23] <adrums20> nope
[02:24] <darwin188> someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know what to do there
[02:24] <deoryp> what do i install to get j++ support?
[02:24] <unperson> adrums20: Odd.
[02:24] <Helldragon> hi
[02:24] <Helldragon> amphi you still there ^
[02:24] <adrums20> thats what I thought.  I have been reading all day on the posts and nothing works after a fresh install
[02:24] <keithsr> when using smbpasswd it gives all options when  i use the options it says it had to abort
[02:25] <Helldragon> grub works, but i cant boot on linux, only windows, when i try to boot on any linux kernel it says error 17 : sda8 not mounted
[02:25] <unperson> adrums20: I'm not quite sure what that means.  You could do "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow"
[02:25] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- is the linux box on line then?
[02:25] <Helldragon> mount /dev/sda8 doesnt work
[02:25] <unperson> adrums20: The second field is a crypted password.
[02:25] <darwin188> no its offline
[02:25] <Helldragon> anyone can help me
[02:25] <darwin188> linux is recently installed and unconfigured to do anything
[02:25] <deoryp> anyone have any hint for me ? =- what do i install to get j++
[02:25] <unperson> adrums20: It should be a bunch of jibberish (don't post it here), but it might be a "*".
[02:26] <unperson> adrums20: A "*" indicates no password set.
[02:26] <darwin188> but i get to errors
[02:26] <deoryp> Helldragon i can try
[02:26] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- what happens when you try that dpkg command?
[02:26] <amphi> Helldragon: because sda8 is your swap partition, IIRC from your fdisk -l output - what is the kernel command line in grub?
[02:26] <adrums20> once I do that command, it goes back to the prompt
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
[02:26] <darwin188> i get into a blue screen
[02:26] <darwin188> with options
[02:26] <darwin188> for selecting drivers, resolutions, keyboards etc
[02:26] <Helldragon> i dont understand amphi
=== sub|off is now known as sub|at|alpopel
[02:26] <darwin188> but everythging seems to be selected just fine
[02:27] <darwin188> when i do startx
[02:27] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- ok, that's good.  Get there
[02:27] <unperson> adrums20: Wait, you did "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow" and got no output?
[02:27] <darwin188> i get error of Unable to find a vlaid framebuffer device
[02:27] <darwin188> okey
[02:27] <amphi> Helldragon: linux is trying to mount the wrong partition as / AFAICS
[02:27] <adrums20> thats correct - nothing
[02:27] <Helldragon> thats weird
[02:27] <Helldragon> how can i fix that
[02:27] <lufis> For those of you who know your way around linux, how long did it take for you to get down the basics?
[02:27] <Helldragon>  fdisk -l output says nothing
[02:28] <adrums20> im using bash
[02:28] <unperson> adrums20: Ok...  Well, do "sudo less /etc/shadow"
[02:28] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- do you have an option in there to not look for a framebuffer dev?
[02:28] <_gus_> where do i setup enviroment variables ?
[02:28] <adrums20> nothing goes back to the prompt again
[02:28] <unperson> That should allow you to view the contents of the /etc/shadow file (which contains your crypted passwords).
[02:28] <darwin188> someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know i guess
[02:28] <darwin188> wait i guess
[02:28] <amphi> Helldragon: in the grub menu, choose linux, hit e, go to the kernel line, and if it says root=/dev/sda8 try changing it to /dev/sda7
[02:28] <Helldragon> ok
[02:28] <unperson> adrums20: Hmm...something is very, very messed up there.
[02:28] <Helldragon> ill try brb
[02:28] <adrums20> think a reinstall?
[02:29] <darwin188> use kernel framebuffer device interfcace
[02:29] <darwin188> yes or no?
[02:29] <unperson> adrums20: Well...that's probably premature.
[02:29] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- no
[02:29] <wims> breezy is v5.10, right?
[02:29] <adrums20> im still a newbie at this..and I just installed it last night
[02:29] <amphi> Helldragon: then you hit esc and b to boot IIRC - it's been a while
[02:29] <darwin188> autodetect keyboard
[02:29] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- yeap
[02:29] <amphi> Helldragon: er, enter and b
[02:30] <darwin188> i skipped all the keyboard stuff
[02:30] <scabootssca> hey ubuntu started printing error messages any idea what they are? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14343
[02:30] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- fine
[02:30] <PORDO> anyone else unable to use google search?
[02:30] <unperson> adrums20: Hmm...I have to go.  Hopefully someone more knowledgable than me can help.  What you're saying should NOT result from a normal install, though, so either you're doing something simple wrong (that I'm just missing) or something was VERY messed up with your install.
[02:30] <darwin188> now i am on configuring xserver-xorg..select the x.org server modules that should be loaded by default
[02:30] <wims> PORDO, works for me
[02:30] <amphi> PORDO: google works from here
[02:30] <adrums20> alrighty thanks bud
[02:31] <unperson> adrums20: Good luck.  Sorry to run.
[02:31] <adrums20> anyone know how to login as root -
[02:31] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- ok what kind of hardware do you have and what are the choices?  I usually just make a reasonable guess
[02:31] <PORDO> the first one i bought, yesterday, was a dud..so i took it back today and forgot to return one little piece, still in my pocket.  now i have two stylii.
[02:31] <slackern> adrums20: i usually just do 'sudo -i'
[02:32] <wims> adrums20,  can't you just use sudo -s from your normal user instead of logging in with root ?
[02:32] <darwin188> the video card is an ati radeon 16 megas
[02:32] <adrums20> for some reason after a fresh install, I cant
[02:32] <darwin188> i have cohices already selected glcore bitmap ddc dri extmod freetype glx int10 tuupe1
[02:33] <adrums20> after every sudo anything I do, it goes back to the command prompt
[02:33] <darwin188> the unselected ones are dbe record and v41
[02:33] <adrums20> nothing happends
[02:33] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- I think that's straight.  Is there a radion on the list?
[02:33] <deoryp> j++ help?
[02:33] <deoryp> where to get it?
[02:34] <darwin188> that list was way at the beginning but yes there was
[02:34] <darwin188> its already selected
[02:34] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- Just don't select for a really high res when you get to that point, and see if it works ; )
[02:34] <Old> if i deleted a dir, is there a way to recover it?
[02:34] <darwin188> okey

[02:44] <HellDragon> so grub is poop
[02:45] <darwin188> wait a sec
[02:45] <HellDragon> !!!!!!!!!!!!!
[02:45] <ubotu> HellDragon: No idea, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/

[02:45] <HellDragon> !kernel panic
[02:45] <ubotu> Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, HellDragon
[02:45] <darwin188> yes it asked tath
[02:45] <jhenn> Is ubuntu generally good at detecting video cards?  My video card was "detected" but its updating slowly. Any ideas guys?
[02:45] <kuja> Taru: You actually found your way to IRC on your own?
[02:46] <HellDragon> lol
[02:46] <HellDragon> amphi ill test another time brb
[02:46] <Taru> Kuja: Yes, it is quite easy actually.
[02:46] <Old> amphi, can you understand this?: Output from command .. ./settings.conf: line 2: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 10: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 29: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 34: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 36: : command not found usage ./start.sh start|stop|restart|status|watch|clean
[02:46] <amphi> HellDragon: grub has never broken for me, so perhaos it's not grub...
[02:46] <darwin188> ruchbah - i am already at the configuration screens
[02:46] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- I don't know.  I'm a bit lost here.  I think try a bit of trial and error.
[02:46] <darwin188> ok
[02:47] <darwin188> but you think this is the way to solve the problem?
[02:47] <amphi> Old: whatever commands are being invoked from those lines are not found ;)
[02:47] <darwin188> or is there another possible cause of the problem
[02:47] <cocox> if i already install amule but i want to uninstall it, how can i know what is the name of the package for make an dpkg -r ?????
[02:47] <Old> oh ...grrr
[02:47] <Taru> Kuja: 42% -_-
[02:47] <kuja> Taru: So you... got into GNOME?
[02:47] <kuja> Taru: Or are you on your brother's computer right now?
[02:48] <Taru> Kuja: Not yet ; ;
[02:48] <amphi> cocox: apt-get remove [--purge]  amule ?
[02:48] <ruchbah_> darwin188 -- I've never messed with a framebuffer problem.  I know the regular X set up fairly well, but we're a bit out of my relm
[02:48] <Taru> Kuja: Still on my brother's computer.
[02:48] <jhenn> Is ubuntu generally good at detecting video cards?  My video card was "detected" but its updating slowly. Any ideas guys?
[02:48] <darwin188> okey then
[02:48] <darwin188> thanks for your time
[02:48] <amphi> jhenn: what card is it?
[02:48] <ruchbah_> your welcome
[02:49] <Old> amphi, http://www.ew-clan.co.uk/tuts/images/webtut2.jpg
[02:49] <Old> thats how it looks atm
[02:49] <Old> the settings.conf / start.sh are in .bin
[02:49] <sflash> in my ubuntu i installed
[02:49] <Taru> Kuja: I have to go back and forth, it's getting really lame.
[02:49] <sflash> in cspan i have to use make
[02:49] <amphi> Old: how what looks? I'm on dialup...
[02:49] <sflash> and there is no make in the bin directory
[02:49] <Old> Look at the picture if you can, thats how the setup looks
[02:49] <amphi> sflash: install build-esential perhaps
[02:49] <sflash> is this correct
[02:49] <kuja> Taru: Well... that's your fault :P
[02:49] <sflash> ok
[02:49] <amphi> Old: setup of what?
[02:49] <Taru> Kuja: 54% :/
[02:50] <Old> the webmin
[02:50] <Taru> Kuja: No :P
[02:50] <Old> amphi, does this command work on ubuntu?: sh start.sh start
[02:50] <amphi> Old: er, I'm not on ubuntu atm ;)
[02:50] <HellDragon> amphi guess what
[02:50] <Old> well, does "sh start.sh start" work for debian/ubuntu? Does it even excist?
[02:50] <jhenn> amphi: i don't know what card it is?  will lspci tell me?
[02:51] <HellDragon> i had to change the first line :O from hd(0,7) to hd(0,6)
[02:51] <HellDragon> and it worked
[02:51] <Old> I think there's where the problem is
[02:51] <HellDragon> didnt touch the root line
[02:51] <terry> hello I need help for install emacs....??
[02:51] <MorbidHunger> shiity ass dinner
[02:51] <terry> in my ubuntu
[02:51] <amphi> Old: you don't need the initial sh if the script is executable
[02:51] <cocox> amphi, apt-get remove amule , and apt-get --purge amule doesnt works!!
[02:51] <Old> amphi, what do you mean? what should i write there?
[02:51] <Old> ./start.sh start ?
[02:51] <Old> or?
[02:52] <sflash> build-essential is not found
[02:52] <amphi> HellDragon: that'd help, as (hd0,7) is your swap partition according to fdisk
[02:52] <thrice`> terry, sudo apt-get install emacs ?
[02:52] <amphi> cocox: how did you install it?
[02:53] <amphi> cocox: man apt-get might be worth looking at too, BTW
[02:53] <amphi> HellDragon: anyway, you have it working

[02:55] <amphi> cocox: so apt-get remove it
[02:55] <cocox> amphi, im looking at the man dpkg an i know how to uninstall but i must have the name of the package
[02:55] <amphi> cocox: you know the name of the package - it doesn't change after you install it

[02:56] <amphi> cocox: so it's no longer installed
[02:56] <cr1mson> Where can I get dependancies like glib, sh-utils, file-utils, gawk, textutils and bin/sh?
[02:56] <AngryElf> so, there's this nifty litlte "digital out" 8mm plug on my Audigy2 card, i assume that means i can somehow connect it to my home theatre box -- is it supported by linux?
[02:56] <amphi> cocox: apt-cache search amule
[02:56] <cr1mson> glibc
[02:57] <cocox> amphi but i still have a lot of files about amule.... and i dont know how can i uninstall them
[02:57] <Dr_Willis> AngryElf,  the digital out can work :P
[02:57] <Dr_Willis> i use it onmy Audigy2 all the time
[02:57] <Dr_Willis> may need to twiddle with the sliders/mixer controls.

[02:58] <thrice`> terry, we need an error to help you
[02:58] <thrice`> !es
[02:59] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[02:59] <Dr_Willis> Old,  care to rephrase that.
[02:59] <sflash> do you think if i uninstall cpan and reinstall it will have a make file?
[02:59] <man_exec> hi all
[02:59] <Old> I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
[02:59] <HellDragon> oh i forgot: thank you very much for helping me amphi
[03:00] <AngryElf> Dr_Willis, what kind of wire/connection/converter do you use....and into what input on your stereo?
[03:00] <man_exec> I'm looking for help with agpgart and a radeon 9600
[03:00] <cocox> terry, que mensaje te sale ?
[03:00] <HellDragon> omg........ with every music player my songs are slow
[03:00] <HellDragon> wtf
[03:00] <HellDragon> anyone can help me ?
[03:00] <jhenn> 256AV]  (rev 12)
[03:00] <vars> /dev/sda1
[03:00] <amphi> HellDragon: yw - it's strange that grub was so misguided - did you move partitions around or something?
[03:00] <vars> wha tis that?
[03:00] <Old> Dr_Willis, I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
[03:00] <HellDragon> amphi: i just resized a partition with the evil partition magic
[03:01] <terry> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[03:01] <terry> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[03:01] <thrice`> terry, ok, are you using apt-get or synaptic or anything else?
[03:01] <HellDragon> aahhhhh i want my normal sound back
[03:01] <HellDragon> ;(
[03:01] <Dr_Willis> Old,  using screen you can rename the screen sessions. check the screen tutorials.. or you can always edit your .screenrc file and have it create one every time
[03:02] <terry> now I use both
[03:02] <HellDragon> its weird
[03:02] <HellDragon> damn it
[03:02] <Old> Dr_Willis, i want to create a new one called speedlink? I get a error when starting my game-server with webadmin, the error is:Output from command .. No screen session found.
[03:02] <cocox> terry, apt-cache search emacs | grep emacs
[03:02] <Old> I guess I have to start a screen called speedlink
[03:02] <terry> but didn't work
[03:02] <terry> a ok
[03:02] <thrice`> terry, you can only use one at a time
[03:02] <Dr_Willis> Old,  you sure its not saying you need to have screen running?
[03:03] <Old> Exactly, I think i need a screen running, but how do i run one ?
[03:03] <Dr_Willis> Old,  it MAY be refering to the 'screen' command.
[03:04] <amphi> HellDragon: oh, yes, I'd forgotten that you'd sinned ;)
[03:04] <nickpresta> I need help with my mouse. It sometimes randomly moves around my screen, locks the y-axis and only moves along the x-axis and will randomly click while it moves. Any help?
[03:04] <Dr_Willis> or it may be using 'screen session in' a rather vague way.
[03:04] <HellDragon> im getting crazy
[03:04] <HellDragon> damn sound
[03:04] <Taru> Kuja: All finished, now what?
[03:04] <HellDragon> everything plays at 0.5 speed
[03:04] <Taru> Kuja: Reboot?
[03:04] <HellDragon> damnit
[03:05] <amphi> HellDragon: it's trying to calm you down ;)
[03:05] <HellDragon> what happened to my sound
[03:05] <HellDragon> even the sound in my games is slow
[03:05] <HellDragon> what happened
[03:05] <kuja> Taru: No -- sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[03:05] <Taru> Kuja: Okay
[03:06] <Old> Dr_Willis, yes? that's what im talking about i guess?
[03:06] <NytShade> I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
[03:06] <Dr_Willis> Old,  run 'screen' then in a terminal - i guess
[03:06] <Taru> Kuja: Okay it works this time.
[03:06] <terry> how can I open the emacs....???
[03:06] <HellDragon> what happened to my sound !!! nooooooooooooo
[03:07] <amphi> Old: it wants you to start a command in screen with a particular session name?
[03:07] <Old> exactly
[03:07] <kuja> Taru: Find where it says `Identifier "Generic Video Card"'
[03:07] <amphi> Old: screen -S foo will do that
[03:07] <Dr_Willis> amphi,  somthing seems - odd about that. do ya think?
[03:07] <kuja> Taru: And below that line should be a Driver "nv", which you should replace the "nv" with "nvidia" (unless it's already done)
[03:08] <nickpresta> Any mouse help?
[03:08] <Old> amphi, what's dmS ?
[03:08] <Old> -dmS
[03:08] <Old> !pastebin
[03:08] <amphi> Dr_Willis: the whole thing seems odd
[03:08] <ubotu> from memory, pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
[03:08] <amphi> Old: args to screen - man screen for more ;)
[03:09] <amphi> Old: -d means run detached from a tty
[03:09] <ruchbah> nickpresta -- how newbie are you?
[03:09] <Taru> Kuja: It's "nv".
[03:09] <Old> k
[03:09] <kuja> Taru: Change it to "nvidia"
[03:09] <Old> how to kill all procces including "speedlink" init ?
[03:09] <kuja> Taru: Then hit Control+O and Enter
[03:09] <nickpresta> I'm familiar with *nix like systems but I haven't had this problem before or the inner workins of X so I don't know how to fix it/diagnose it.
[03:09] <ruchbah> nickpresta -- do you know how to look at /etc/X11/Xorg.conf ?
[03:09] <nickpresta> yeah
[03:09] <nickpresta> It looks fine to me
[03:09] <Taru> Kuja: Okay, done.
[03:10] <kuja> Taru: Afterwards, exit nano (Ctrl+X) then type: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start', then you should be at the login screen. At which point you type your username and password.
[03:10] <ruchbah> nickpresta -- take a look see what your mouse driver is listed at there
[03:10] <Old> amphi, how do i kill all procces having "speedlink" in their name ?
[03:10] <Taru> Kuja: Okay!
[03:10] <slackern> Old: 'pgrep speedlink' will show what pids match speedlink
[03:10] <amphi> Old: IMHO, a sane way to do this is to have the script start the server and write the PID to a pidfile in, say, /var/run, and then the stop script will just kill [-9]  `cat /var/run/$PIDFILE`
[03:10] <Old> gave me nada..
[03:11] <slackern> Old: 'pkill speedlink' should kill them all im not so used to it but i belive it will.
[03:11] <ruchbah> nickpresta -- it will be near the top under Section "InputDevice"
[03:11] <Old> didnt work
[03:11] <Old> I have a few "screen -R speedlink" running
[03:11] <deadlycow21> can anyone help me with ndiswrapper... I have a WG311v3 by NETGEAR, i cannot get this to work... My card is on the compatablity list, but it doesn't appear to work, can anyone please tell me how to get this working? is it even compatable?
[03:11] <Taru> Kuja: Okay, I'm just logged in.
[03:11] <kuja> Taru: Okay, so now you're inside GNOME?
[03:13] <kuja> Taru: If you're on GNOME now, right click on your desktop then click "Create Launcher"
[03:13] <deadlycow21> can anyone help me with ndiswrapper... I have a WG311v3 by NETGEAR, i cannot get this to work... My card is on the compatablity list, but it doesn't appear to work, can anyone please tell me how to get this working? is it even compatable?
[03:13] <Taru> Kuja: Let me log XChat on my computer now.
[03:13] <kuja> Okay

[03:14] <Taru> Kuja: Finally on my computer.
[03:14] <kuja> Okay cool.
[03:14] <I_Love_DRM> I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
[03:14] <Taru> Kuja: It was already there.
[03:14] <kuja> Taru: sudo apt-get install gtkpod exfalso
[03:15] <Taru> Kuja: Okay.
[03:15] <nickpresta> If someone can help me with this, I will love you forever. It's not much, but it has promise =)
[03:16] <Taru> Kuja: Separately?
[03:16] <kuja> Taru: Just that entire command
[03:16] <kuja> Run it from gnome-terminal
[03:16] <Taru> Kuja: I did that and it didn't find it.
[03:16] <kuja> Oh.. hmm
[03:16] <HellDragon> im getting crazy
[03:16] <HellDragon> damn sound
[03:16] <Taru> Kuja: I ran GTKPOD only.
[03:17] <NytShade> I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
[03:17] <kuja> Taru: 'sudo apt-get install gtkpod' -- Doesn't work?
[03:17] <DBO> HellDragon, you cant reboot?
[03:17] <thrice`> you'd sacrifice cpu power just to use automatrix?
[03:18] <thrice`> !automatrix
[03:18] <ubotu> Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, thrice`
[03:18] <Taru> Kuja: No, "gtkpod exfalso" together didn't work.
[03:18] <NytShade> I'm a complete beginer, so yes if that's what it takes to make it look beter, I'd cosider it.
[03:18] <Taru> Kuja: Now "sudo apt-get install exfalso" is not working for me.
[03:18] <kuja> Taru: Type: sudo apt-get install gtkpod
[03:18] <Taru> Kuja: That is done.
[03:19] <kuja> Taru: Connect your iPod.
[03:19] <Taru> Kuja: It is connected.
[03:19] <NytShade> I can't even seem to get it to recognise my resolution can go above 1024.
[03:19] <Taru> Kuja: "E Couldn't find package exfalso"
[03:19] <kuja> Taru: Forget about exfalso for now.
[03:19] <I_Love_DRM> Hi Guys -    I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
[03:19] <Taru> Kuja: Okay.
[03:20] <kuja> Taru: Type: gtkpod
[03:20] <Taru> Kuja: Okay.
[03:20] <kuja> Taru: Then see if you can read from your iPod.
[03:20] <Taru> Kuja: Yes, that works.
[03:20] <kuja> So all your music is there?
[03:20] <Taru> Kuja: Let me check.
[03:21] <Taru> Kuja: Yes, it's all there.
[03:21] <Taru> =)
[03:21] <suspekt> anyone with any wine experience?
[03:21] <Taru> Kuja: Hashed 400/400.
[03:22] <Taru> Kuja: Time to remove the horrible songs :P
[03:22] <hypnox> anyone know why my /dev/dsp is permanently 'busy' even though alsa is supposed to be mixing and emulating oss?
[03:22] <nickpresta> @I_Love_DRM: Right click on your taskbar and click "Add Applet/Application to Panel"
[03:22] <kuja> Taru: What horrible songs?
[03:22] <nickpresta> Hi Mau
[03:23] <NytShade> thrice`: Any idea of how much cpu power I would be sacrificing for asthetics?
[03:23] <Taru> Kuja: Placebo.... :P
=== mheath[laptop] _ is now known as mheath[laptop] 
[03:23] <kuja> Taru: Screw you
[03:23] <Taru> Kuja: ><
[03:23] <hoaryLiveCD> hi there
[03:24] <bur[n] er> I_Love_DRM: right click the panel, add to panel
[03:24] <Taru> Kuja: Now, why the hell won't exfalso work??
[03:24] <Taru> Kuja: What else to download and install?
[03:24] <bur[n] er> hoaryLiveCD: damn... hoary is old ;)
[03:25] <bur[n] er> hypnox: is your user part of the "audio" group?
[03:25] <hypnox> yup
[03:25] <kuja> Taru: It says there's no installation candidate for exfalso?
[03:25] <kwtm> suspekt: Is it a wine problem that you have, or should you just set your entire desktop to 640x480 before activating wine?
[03:25] <bur[n] er> hypnox: you're sure /dev/dsp permissions are correct?
[03:25] <Taru> Kuja, No, but Azureus says that :/
[03:26] <hypnox> +rw for group audio
[03:26] <hoaryLiveCD> yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
[03:26] <kuja> Taru: Setting up Java is a bit more complicated.
[03:26] <bur[n] er> hypnox: what if you just chmod 777 /dev/dsp?
[03:26] <Taru> Kuja: "E: Couldnt' find package exfalso"
[03:26] <Taru> Kuja: I see.
[03:26] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
[03:27] <hypnox> nope.. its busy not permission problems
[03:27] <amphi> hypnox: you perhaps need to use the alsa dmix plugin
[03:27] <bur[n] er> hypnox: ok ok, i believe you... i don't know hte answer though :\
[03:27] <kuja> Taru: Type: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:27] <Taru> Kuja: Okay.
[03:28] <hypnox> amphi , am doing, doesnt do it for me yet somehow
[03:28] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: are you a tech?
[03:28] <bur[n] er> hoaryLiveCD: in my professional career, yes
[03:28] <bur[n] er> hoaryLiveCD: however, i administer windows servers on a day to day basis :\  linux is for fun
[03:28] <kuja> Taru: Are there any commented lines that you missed and should be uncommented?
[03:28] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: lol... unprofessional answer
[03:29] <k4st`> For some reason I can't get mod_userdir to work w/ dapper's apache2 package
[03:29] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: yeah linux is for gurus
[03:29] <amphi> hypnox: I tried dmix, it seemed to work, but I like my box to only make one noise at a time  ;)
[03:29] <Taru> Kuja: All "deb http:/" and "deb-src" are uncommented.
[03:29] <nomasteryoda|w> not exactly true... by any sense of the word guru
[03:30] <bur[n] er> hoaryLiveCD: I've installed a few debian machines as simpel samba servers, but that's the extent
[03:30] <nomasteryoda|w> Ubuntu is as close to perfect as could be for ANY OS
[03:30] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: do you like windows server better than linux
[03:30] <tulga> I need install tomcat on dapper. where I find good howto?
[03:30] <amphi> bur[n] er: then you can peacefully liberate their machines when they have to upgrade for vista ;)
[03:30] <bur[n] er> hoaryLiveCD: i haven't found a good exchange replacement yet, but I wouldn't say I "like" windows ;)
[03:30] <wims> i was just able to enable ati drivers after trying for days yay !
[03:30] <mugzie> can u get rhapsity on here
[03:30] <nomasteryoda|w> wims, great
[03:31] <coucho> later dudes
[03:31] <nomasteryoda|w> persistance pays off
[03:31] <bur[n] er> amphi: i would love to... ubuntu is soooooooo close... dapper is amazing
[03:31] <k4st`> this line: Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load should be loading up mod_userdir, but everything i can see tells me its not working
[03:31] <mugzie> but ubuntu kinda limited since its linux
[03:31] <nomasteryoda|w> bur[n] er, yes it is and the installer on the live disk rocks
[03:31] <mugzie> or maybe i just cant do what i want
[03:32] <wims> one little thing, i'm using dual head, but i can't move one program from one screen to the other, i have to keep the window on the screen i started it on, does anybody know how i can change it so that it's basically one big desktop?
[03:32] <nomasteryoda|w> limited?
[03:32] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: lol... I just put together this simle script with some folders with pages and data on a flash drive to set up apache2 on LiveCD to introduce some peole to linux
[03:32] <nomasteryoda|w> hoaryLiveCD, cool
[03:32] <bur[n] er> nomasteryoda|w: i have yet to get espresso to get passed disk partitioning, but it looks promising
[03:32] <mugzie> how would i make a live cd
[03:32] <bur[n] er> er... s/espresso/ubiquity
[03:32] <hoaryLiveCD> bur[n] er: lol... yeah
[03:32] <mugzie> i would like to test linux on my desktop
[03:32] <nomasteryoda|w> bur[n] er, if you tried LVM, then that requires a reboot after starting it..
[03:32] <nomasteryoda|w> then it will install properly
[03:32] <mugzie> i have it on my old old old laptop so its veryslow
[03:32] <hoaryLiveCD> nomasteryoda|w: lol... yeah
[03:32] <amphi> bur[n] er: ISTR reading about something called openexchange, dunno how much of a dropin replacement it is
[03:33] <bur[n] er> amphi: openxchange doesn't quite cut it and it's far from free
[03:33] <hoaryLiveCD> nomasteryoda|w: are you a tech?
[03:33] <nomasteryoda|w> we had that issue yesterday at our LUG meeting where satempler installed Ubuntu dapper F7 over his Kubuntu

[03:38] <MorbidHunger> most likeley
[03:38] <bur[n] er> h3h_timo: open nautilus... ctrl+L... smb://computerwithsharedfiles/music... drag and drop into rhythmbox or something that supports gnomevfs
[03:38] <bur[n] er> h3h_timo: you can also do a samba mount
[03:39] <MorbidHunger> /usr/X11R6/bin/
[03:39] <MorbidHunger> http://www.transgaming.com/
[03:39] <MorbidHunger> that runs everything
[03:39] <MorbidHunger> sorry about the /usr/X11R6/bin/
[03:39] <h3h_timo> bur[n] er, yeah, i tried to just right clik on the share and mount it, but rythmbox couldnt see the mount
[03:39] <mugzie> ok
[03:39] <nomasteryoda|w> hoaryLiveCD, to play them actually... very cool package
[03:40] <bur[n] er> h3h_timo: where chances are you didn't mount it correctly.... if it's mounted, any app should work.  amarok, rhythmbox, listen, quodlibet, beep-media-player, xmms, etc.
[03:40] <Old> How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
[03:40] <h3h_timo> bur[n] er, thanks

[03:40] <hoaryLiveCD> nomasteryoda|w: sounds vert cool... can i get a looks see
[03:40] <_pm> for the 6.06 version
[03:40] <Taru> Kuja: I sent so many PMs!

[03:40] <Old> Someone please?: How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
[03:41] <kuja> Taru: You're not registered.
[03:41] <sponix> _pm:  http://mplayerhq.hu download link has some codecs
[03:41] <Taru> Kuja: ><
[03:41] <amphi> Old: ps aux | grep speedlink and kill 'em individually; they're all screen processes, no?
[03:41] <bur[n] er> sponix: that was is so hard compared to the wiki link
[03:41] <MorbidHunger> anyone know where i can get libfglrx_pp.so.1
[03:41] <Old> yeah, they're screen processes
[03:41] <Taru> Kuja: Well, exfalso package not found yet :/
[03:41] <bur[n] er> MorbidHunger: did you follow the wiki about the ati binary drivers?
[03:41] <Old> Is there a way to kill them auto? :)
[03:41] <bur[n] er> !tell MorbidHunger about ati
[03:41] <Taru> Kuja: Just installed Amarok.
[03:41] <kuja> Taru: From IRC, type: "/ns register password", where "password" is your password.
[03:41] <_pm> sponix: there is the mplayer in some repositorie?
[03:42] <amphi> Old: you can kill all the screen processes...
[03:42] <bur[n] er> _pm: check your messages
[03:42] <Old> root 17799 0.0 0.0 4192 1648 ? Ss 03:04 0:00 SCREEN -R speedlink
[03:42] <Old> root 17949 0.0 0.0 3924 996 pts/0 S+ 03:11 0:00 screen -S speedlink
[03:42] <Old> root 17950 0.0 0.0 4188 1628 ? Ss 03:11 0:00 SCREEN -S speedlink
[03:42] <Old> root 19389 0.0 0.0 3060 756 pts/10 S+ 03:41 0:00 grep speedlink
[03:42] <Old> what it says
[03:42] <Taru> Kuja: Okay.
[03:42] <Old> that's what it says (Sorry for copy/past)
[03:42] <MorbidHunger> thats scary
[03:42] <_pm> bur[n] er: i read it, but i must play a wmv video
[03:42] <Old> When i kill one it gets back again i think
[03:42] <MorbidHunger> can i install rpms?
[03:42] <bur[n] er> i can play wmvs... did you try totem-xine _pm?
[03:43] <bur[n] er> MorbidHunger: yes, via alien
[03:43] <_pm> let me try it
[03:43] <bur[n] er> MorbidHunger: but it's desirable to find a deb instead of an rpm
[03:43] <hoaryLiveCD> Old: try System Monitor and Kill first one
[03:43] <Old> hoaryLiveCD, system monitor?
[03:44] <bur[n] er> Old: or just "killall screen"
[03:44] <Old> No i run other screen commands aswell
[03:44] <MorbidHunger> meh
[03:44] <MorbidHunger> ill jsut run apt-get
[03:44] <Taru> Kuja: Says, "The nickname [Taru]  is already registered."
[03:44] <hoaryLiveCD> Old: Applications-> System Tools-> System Monitor
[03:44] <tulga> can I use blackdown's JDK instead of Sun JDK for tomcat?
[03:44] <Old> I dont run graphical ubuntu, I run ubuntu server.
[03:45] <kuja> Taru: Haha sucker.
[03:45] <Taru> Kuja: ?
[03:45] <bur[n] er> Old: you can use "ps ax" and "kill (PID#)"
[03:45] <kuja> Taru: Anyways, you made the changes I told you to, right?
[03:45] <Taru> Kuja: Yes.
[03:45] <hoaryLiveCD> or killall speedlink
[03:45] <kuja> Taru: Then from the terminal type: sudo apt-get update
[03:46] <_pm> if i install the beta version, how can i update it when the final version comes out? a apt-get upgrade will do the updatE?
[03:46] <Taru> Kuja: I did.
[03:46] <Taru> Kuja: Doing it again lol.
[03:46] <Taru> Kuja: "Done"
[03:46] <Old> Taru, when typing someones name, ex, if he is named "kuja" type, ku then press *tab*, the nick will pop-up
[03:47] <kuja> Taru: Now try installing exfalso again.
[03:47] <Taru> Old: Okay, thanks ^^
[03:47] <tulga> I cannot use sun-j2sdk for dapper. which repository use???
[03:47] <Old> np Taru
[03:47] <Taru> Old: I typed "Ku" and pressed *tab* and nothing; ;
[03:47] <wims> hmmm, there seems like there's no wine package for 64 breezy in the wine repository, does that mean i have to get the source and build it myself?
[03:47] <amphi> Taru: what client?
[03:48] <Old> exactly, what mirc client are you using... ?
[03:48] <Taru> XChat
[03:48] <kuja> Taru: Because my nickname is in lowercase.
[03:48] <kuja> It doesn't start with 'K', it starts with 'k'
[03:48] <Taru> Kuja: Oh!
[03:48] <amphi> Taru: xchat does tab completion I believe
[03:48] <Taru> kuja, There!
[03:48] <Old> ;)
[03:48] <kuja> :)
[03:48] <Taru> lol
[03:48] <amphi> Taru: irssi'll deal with case errors
[03:49] <Taru> amphi, Thanks^^
[03:49] <kuja> amphi: He's new, better not introduce him to ncurses madness.
[03:49] <Taru> lol
[03:49] <Taru> amphi, I see^^
[03:49] <amphi> kuja: "ncurses's austere beauty", shurely ;)
[03:50] <Old> I give up with webmin
[03:50] <Old> 5hours, waste of time.
[03:50] <amphi> Old: just use ssh ;)
[03:50] <Old> I cant, it's annoying :((
[03:50] <Taru> kuja, "E: Couldn't find package exfalso"
[03:50] <kuja> Hm...
[03:50] <Old> I want to give my users access trough a page, so they can start/close their server
[03:51] <kuja> Um, is exfalso only in the Dapper repositories? Anyone know?
[03:51] <amphi> Old: ah...
[03:51] <Old> easy login, or whatever. 1 account, whatever. I just need it..
[03:52] <maike-maus> is it possible to install the system (dapper flight4) permanently WITHOUT using the espresso  installer?
[03:52] <Old> amphi, you got any clues of how todo an alias? ex ./speedlink would do screen ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 % ?
[03:52] <amphi> Old: why not just have the server start at boot time?
[03:52] <Old> amphi
[03:52] <Old> woot, good idea
[03:52] <Old> how todo that? :D
[03:52] <planetcall> goodmorning
[03:53] <amphi> Old: write an init script for it, stick it in /etc/init.d and use update-rc.d to make the runlevel symlinks
[03:53] <zenlunatic> anyone know how to turn off how windows redraw while you move them?
[03:53] <amphi> Old: you could use an existing script as a skeleton, and modify it
[03:53] <kuja> Taru: Not sure what's wrong with exfalso
[03:53] <amphi> zenlunatic: I know in openbox ;)
[03:53] <Old> amphi, where is it ?
[03:53] <amphi> Old: where is what?
[03:54] <zenlunatic> amphi, hey its jhenn
[03:54] <Old> nevermind, how would a init.d script look like ?
[03:54] <Taru> kuja, :/
[03:54] <amphi> zenlunatic: I suspected as much ;)
[03:54] <amphi> Old: look at some of the ones in /etc/init.d
[03:54] <Old> can i use cd /home/blabla and underneeth it start the server ?
[03:55] <amphi> Old: why do you need to do that?
[03:55] <Old> amphi, how would it else know where to start the server?
[03:55] <amphi> Old: what do you mean, where? Where the binary is?
[03:56] <Old> amphi, the dir is /home/speedlink/ and the command is: ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 %
[03:56] <Old> I dont even know how a init.d script looks like, I looked at it , but i dont know how it works out. Should "PATH=" be init aswell?
[03:57] <Old> Could you perhaps give me an example on pastebin amphi ?
[03:57] <amphi> Old: you can specify absolute paths
[03:57] <Old> I'll write one, one second
[03:57] <Old> and show you how i did it
[03:57] <Old> !pastebin
[03:57] <ubotu> rumour has it, pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
[03:58] <mugzie> yo how do i know whats my user name
[03:58] <Zizou> Hi... does any body running xgl?
[03:58] <Old> amphi, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14425 - would this work?
[03:58] <bur[n] er> mugzie: whoami
[03:59] <bur[n] er> mugzie: type that at a terminal
[03:59] <mugzie> ok
[03:59] <MorbidHunger> your bur[n] er
[03:59] <amphi> Old: I have no idea, I know nothing about that server
[04:00] <amphi> Old: for instance, what is the +map arg? does that need to point at some data file?
[04:00] <Old> amphi, it's a game-server, I just need to know if that looks correctly (dont bother about the ./hlds_run path)
[04:00] <mr_foamfingermak> test
[04:00] <mr_foamfingermak> omg im still on!??
[04:00] <Old> amph, no no, dont bother about the ./hlds_run line, it's correct
[04:00] <mr_foamfingermak> n e 1 c this?
[04:00] <Old> mr_foamfingermak, no
[04:00] <Old> mr_foamfingermak, we dont see it, type something..
[04:00] <amphi> Old: why are you using screen?
[04:01] <Old> what should i use? Im new to ubuntu
[04:01] <Old> I feel so pathethic sometimes...
[04:01] <kuja> Taru: Try installing Gaim too: sudo apt-get install gaim
[04:01] <Tidus> screen is a useful tool
[04:01] <amphi> Tidus: why would you run a server in screen?
[04:01] <mugzie> when i type in codes like this one
[04:01] <Old> what should i use iyho ?
[04:02] <mugzie>  wine "/home/USERNAME/.wine/c/Program Files/Windows Media Player/mplayer2.exe" it says file not found
[04:02] <amphi> Old: does it spew messages to the console while it's running?
[04:02] <Tidus> amphi: so you dont have to leave the terminal open.
[04:02] <Old> yes
[04:02] <mugzie> but for some reason i dont see internet explorer or anything
[04:02] <MorbidHunger> how do i run a deb
[04:02] <Old> if i close putty without screen, = the server dies.
[04:02] <amphi> Tidus: daemons normally run detached from a terminal
[04:02] <Tidus> i run game servers in screen all the time.
[04:02] <Tidus> but most game servers hang on to the terminal
[04:02] <amphi> Tidus: oh, ok, perhaps you can help Old
[04:02] <Old> I reckognize you from somewhere Tidus?
[04:02] <Taru> kuja, Okay.
[04:03] <Taru> kuja, I had to make rice.
[04:03] <Tidus> Old: dunno...
[04:03] <MorbidHunger> like we said, it doesnt work for everything
[04:03] <Tidus> Old: maybe #boinc?
[04:03] <Old> Tidus, where do you work at, do you use qnet?
[04:03] <NickGarvey> what is the command to make swap space?
[04:03] <Old> perhaps an old staff member?
[04:03] <Taru> kuja, I would leave it out for 1 hour... but someone is coming so I just cook it now.
[04:03] <Tidus> old: sorry, not any of those.
[04:03] <Tidus> lol
[04:03] <Old> Ah ok
[04:03] <NickGarvey> mkswap ;) there weg o
[04:03] <NickGarvey> we go*
[04:03] <Taru> kuja, It's going to be hard rice :/
[04:03] <kuja> Heh
[04:03] <kuja> You suck at rice :P
[04:03] <Old> Tidus, can you help me out , can we join a private channel and talk? As im not authed, and my eyes are starting to hurt becuase of the text in the channel
[04:03] <MorbidHunger> how do i run a deb
[04:04] <Taru> kuja, Well after seeing how you guys do it, I know now.
[04:04] <kuja> =P
[04:04] <Taru> kuja, But no time atm ; ;
[04:04] <Old> #chat-bla Tidus, if you can, highly appricaited.
[04:04] <amphi> MorbidHunger: dpkg -i  foo.deb to install
[04:04] <Tidus> old: /join #chat1
[04:04] <rayston> hello
[04:04] <Taru> kuja, Soft rice is much better because you can just keep eating it, hard rice can get full off of ; ;
[04:05] <Taru> kuja, Rather unpleasant at that!
[04:05] <kuja> You and your silly Filipino cooking style.
[04:05] <Kyral> Taru: not true!
[04:05] <Taru> lol
[04:05] <kuja> Hard rice sucks :P
[04:05] <Taru> Kyral: Try soft rice ; ;
[04:05] <Taru> I know ; ;
[04:05] <Kyral> I just tried to put away 5 cups of the stuff
[04:05] <Taru> lol
[04:05] <Kyral> DIDN'T HAPPEN!
[04:05] <Taru> O.O

[04:06] <Kyral> meh
[04:06] <Kyral> c'mon, its not like there was any active support going on here :P
[04:07] <mugzie> when using wine do u have to like always have it open or how do u install programs?
=== blanky is now known as blank_
[04:07] <eggzeck>  you have to have win open while running programs?
[04:07] <eggzeck> s/win/wine/
[04:08] <eggzeck> I think most wine users get confused about it or how it works.
[04:08] <wims> doesn't wine work on 64 bit ubuntu ?
[04:08] <Kyral> you have to use the "wine" program to preface the install command I think
[04:08] <Kyral> and on some distros it "associates" with wine automagically
[04:08] <Kyral> but I have no clue, I don't use Wien
[04:09] <Kyral> wine even
[04:09] <mugzie> so letssay i wanna install windows media player 9 how would i do that
[04:09] <rayston> hey, my second HD on my new install of UBUNTU seems to be mounted as Root, making it so that I effectively cant use it for anything, I can make folders in it, but not any other files, any ideas on how to fix?
[04:09] <MorbidHunger> how do i force the intall of a .deb
[04:09] <Kyral> mugzie: Install VLC :P
[04:09] <amphi> MorbidHunger: not wise
[04:09] <MorbidHunger> true
[04:10] <T`> i dont have chkconfig installed by default.. whats the equivalent in ubuntu?
[04:10] <T`> anyway to tweak which daemons i want to enable.. etc.
[04:10] <mugzie> um naw i just wanted windows 11 i just used 9 as a example
[04:10] <Taru> kuja, Gaim was already installed to the newest version.
[04:10] <kuja> Okay cool.
[04:10] <Taru> kuja, I want exfalso!
[04:10] <kuja> You can run it if you want to get on MSN.
[04:10] <Kyral> T`: sysvconf?
[04:10] <eggzeck> MorbidHunger, dpkg --force-help
[04:11] <Kyral> T`: or something like that
[04:11] <T`> dont hqave that either.. hmm
[04:11] <Kyral> T`: you have to install it :P
[04:11] <mugzie> so i just install a program regularly with wine
[04:11] <mugzie> ?
[04:11] <Compuqiz> hey guys I'm installing ubuntu for the first time and came to a problem. What is "postinst warning: overwriting possible-customised configuration file"?
[04:11] <amphi> MorbidHunger: why do you want to force it?
=== Compuqiz is now known as Compuwiz
[04:12] <eggzeck> mugzie, first off, you can't install EVERYTHING with wine
[04:12] <eggzeck> mugzie, it has to be supported.
[04:12] <mugzie> yea i understand that
[04:12] <MorbidHunger> i cant seem to get the ati control panel working. so i got the file that it said it needed and it wont install
[04:12] <mugzie> hmmm is paltalk supported
[04:12] <mugzie> ?
[04:12] <eggzeck> mugzie, go to the wine website for a list of supported programs.
[04:12] <amphi> Compuwiz: if it's a first install, you can ignore that IMHO
[04:12] <Taru> brb
[04:12] <mugzie> whats the wine website again hehe
[04:12] <eggzeck> the power of google is awesome.
[04:12] <MorbidHunger> www.winehq.com
[04:13] <mugzie> thanks
[04:13] <eggzeck> heh.
[04:13] <rayston> any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to all users?
[04:13] <Compuwiz> yeah it is the first install
[04:13] <MorbidHunger> any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to me?
[04:13] <Compuwiz> but now I'm stuck at a command prompt and I dont know how to continue
[04:13] <eggzeck> MorbidHunger, if it won't install, forcing it will not make it work.
[04:13] <MorbidHunger> it says it cant overrite some file
[04:14] <mugzie> where the supported programz list located at?
[04:14] <eggzeck> perhaps permissions are bad? And make sure you *want* it to overwrite that file. (whatever it may be)
[04:15] <MorbidHunger> meh
[04:15] <Compuwiz> so I need to change the permissions of that one file?
[04:15] <thev> is there a package for gimp 2.3?
[04:15] <T`> anyone running ubuntu on a laptop?
[04:15] <eggzeck> Compuwiz, that was my reply for MorbidHunger not you
[04:15] <Compuwiz> oh, haha. my bad
[04:15] <amphi> !tell T` about ask
[04:16] <T`> i'm curious if you guys do any harddisk power management
[04:16] <amphi> T`: I use hdparm to spin down the disk here
[04:16] <mugzie> ok the program is ok paltalk is supported so do i just install regular o how would i do that?
[04:16] <T`> amphi, manually?
[04:16] <T`> amphi, or you run the daemon?
[04:16] <T`> i see soemthing in /etc/init.d
[04:16] <amphi> T`: no, an acpi script sets the timeout
[04:17] <T`> amphi, umm i c.. where can i find that? think you can help me set that up please?
=== thev is now known as theverant
[04:17] <eggzeck> mugzie, looks like you need to read about using wine. Please do so.
[04:17] <amphi> T`: look at the scripts under /etc/acpi
[04:17] <GaiaX11> Why is that I cannot connect to my hotmail through konqueror? I give the right passw but it don't access my account? I think it is about certificate, but i do not know how to set up them.
[04:17] <T`> amphi, i got a bunch of them
[04:17] <amphi> T`: there may well be a gui tool in gnome for this; I wrote my scripts myself
[04:17] <Taru> kuja, To move all my songs to my harddrive from i-pod, do I extract them from database?
[04:18] <mugzie> theres a winechat right?
[04:18] <Compuwiz> ...any ideas how to fix the postinst error?
[04:18] <eggzeck> mugzie: http://www.winehq.org/site/howto
[04:18] <kuja> Taru: Probably
[04:18] <T`> amphi, are these scripts executed when you press buttons or something? where are those hooks?
[04:18] <Taru> kuja, Okay.
[04:18] <T`> or perhaps acpi events
[04:18] <h3h_timo> is there a way to edit the gnome keychain
[04:18] <amphi> T`: pm?
[04:18] <T`> sure
[04:19] <tagabasak_> hi all
[04:19] <Quartlow> New user here, I'm running this from a cd, is there any way to get to my hard drive?
[04:20] <h3h_timo> Quartlow, yes, get the install cd, and then run the installer
[04:20] <amphi> T`: bah, you're not identified to services
[04:20] <T`> oops.. sec
[04:20] <tagabasak_> anyony here can help me on how can i repair my grub?
[04:20] <T`> amphi, actually i am
[04:20] <Quartlow> h3h_timo, so it can't be done from the live cd then?
[04:20] <T`> -NickServ- You have already identified
[04:21] <h3h_timo> Quartlow, not to my knowledge
[04:21] <Quartlow> Cool, thanks for the quick answer. h3h. I snooped around and couldn't figure it out.
[04:21] <Tenshi> how do I get my cups client to show printers that are broadcast/shared on the network ?
[04:21] <laserline> Quartlow, there should be an icon from your desktop... double click on that and it should run esspresso installer....unless you have an older version of ubuntu, but i know dapper has it... does breezy too
[04:22] <Taru> kuja, It is saying that the songs did not match file type and so it will not export all my songs...
[04:22] <h3h_timo> Quartlow, maybe ^^ that works
[04:22] <h3h_timo> lol
[04:22] <Taru> Wonder what happened to my songs on my i-pod.
[04:22] <kuja> Taru: Err, figure it out later.
[04:22] <Taru> ><\
[04:22] <kuja> I think I need to try and sleep a little bit now
[04:22] <Quartlow> Laser the only one on the dektop is one for the cdrom.
[04:22] <Taru> Sleep ><
[04:22] <Taru> Peace Kuja!
[04:22] <tagabasak_> how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
[04:22] <laserline> Quartlow what version of the Ubuntu live CD do you have
[04:22] <kuja> Taru: Just leave your computer on.
[04:23] <Taru> kuja, lol
[04:23] <frank__> can I create a new partition in my empty space on the same drive that my running ubuntu is on?
[04:23] <Quartlow> Good question, I just downloaded the iso yesterday and this only the second time i've used it. Kind of test driving
[04:24] <Quartlow> 2.21
[04:24] <tagabasak_> how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
[04:24] <Managu> Quartlow:  It should definitely be possible to access your hard drive from the live CD.  It's also very likely to be read-only access.  How easy it'll be to set up is another question
[04:24] <h3h_timo> how do you open the gnome keychain?
[04:24] <Quartlow> 10/30/2005
[04:24] <Managu> !tell tagabasak_ about grub
[04:25] <ricardo> anyone here hi.. i installed ati drivers.. now i installed cedega im running diablo 2 a windows 98 game with 8mb video and im lagging my FPS are suuky in the game..
[04:25] <Taru> Anyone know why I cannot apt-get frostwire or exfalso?
[04:25] <h3h_timo> !exfalso
[04:25] <ubotu> h3h_timo: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:25] <Taru> Keeps saying "E: Couldn't find package frostwire"
[04:25] <h3h_timo> what is exfalso
[04:25] <Taru> exfalso yes please!
[04:26] <Quartlow> Managu, read only would be fine. I just wanted access to my bookmarks, some jpg and mp3 files.
[04:26] <Quartlow> I just want to get more familar with it before I go trying to install it
[04:26] <Taru> exfalso is a program that allows you to organize song tabs and stuff.
[04:26] <psYchotic> ladies and gents, good evening
[04:26] <psYchotic> I have a little question
[04:27] <Taru> h3h_timo, Like make all your songs look neat and in good order in your computer and i-pod.
[04:27] <psYchotic> why is it that my at jobs seem to hang when they were issued by my normal user, while it all works wonderfully well when issued by root?
[04:28] <Managu> quartlow: I don't know offhand how to find the partition using the gui.  From the command line, you can "sudo fdisk -l" (careful, dangerous command if mistyped! that's a lowercase L) to find the partition name of your windows drive.  If you've got nothing special installed and only 1 hard drive, it's probably /dev/hda1 (first partition on primary master drive).
[04:29] <PORDO> I DID something weird tonight...
[04:30] <psYchotic> it's kinda driving me nuts, my username isn't listen in /etc/at.deny, but my at jobs seem to run forever without actually doing anything
[04:30] <PORDO> i was sitting in an caf in san francisco, typing esperanto in a jabber conference room on my nokia 770 over a wi-fi connection.
[04:30] <Managu> quartlow: once that's done, you can type "sudo mount <device name> /mnt -o umask=777" to mount that partition under /mnt.  It will then be accessible under the gui at places -> filesystem -> mnt
=== rayonp is now known as Cadaveria
[04:32] <dust> i've got a ipod problem. i'm using 5.10 and installed banshee and gtkpod but my computer isn't registering the ipod properly
[04:32] <Quartlow> Mangu, I tried the mount command, once I found a terminal. as mount /dev/hda1 . and got the response can't find /dev/hda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[04:33] <psYchotic> Quartlow, is your partition an NTFS or a FAT one?
[04:33] <Managu> quartlow: "sudo mount /dev/hda /mnt -o umask=777"
[04:33] <dust> in the wiki it mentions something for hoary and i was thinking of trying it, is it a bad idea-- does anyone have any ideas?
[04:33] <Managu> quartlow: sorry, /dev/hda1 instead of /dev/hda
[04:34] <Quartlow> Mang, the sudo mount line returned this,,, you must specify file system type
[04:34] <pianoboy3333> http://www.hilineeng.com/electrical_controls/food_processing/food_processing.jpg
[04:35] <Managu> quartlow: that's unfortunate.  Even with the correction I made?
[04:35] <Quartlow> PsYchotic , i'm guessing fat since it has windows installed
[04:35] <mugzie> hey i just installed something but i dont see it in my application where are the stuff i installed at with wine?
[04:36] <tagabasak_> a newbie question here, what is the default root password for ubuntu live cd 5.10?
[04:36] <psYchotic> coz if it's fat, you need to mount it like this "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/whatever -o umask=777"
[04:36] <Quartlow> ok sorry Manugo, now I get no such file or directory
[04:36] <Managu> tagabasak_: there is no root password
[04:36] <mugzie> anyone know
[04:36] <tagabasak_> Managu, ok thnx
[04:36] <itrebal> how can i setup printers? whats the Gnome program to do it? i dont use Gnome so i need to know the progrma name..
[04:36] <Managu> mugzie: ~/.wine/c_drive/Program Files/
[04:36] <tagabasak_> Managu, how can i use the root privilegde
[04:36] <Managu> mugzie: or something similar
[04:37] <Managu> !root
[04:37] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[04:37] <tagabasak_> Managu, when i typed su it ask me to enter a password?
[04:37] <mugzie> in terminal and there a way to add it to my start bar or something?
[04:37] <Managu> tagabasak_: yup.  And since there's no root password, "su" will always fail.
[04:37] <itrebal> tagabasak_: in the 'expert' install you can set it up to have a root password (i did this time, on accident)
[04:38] <tagabasak_> Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
[04:38] <itrebal> tagabasak_: you would use sudo in stead, and if you REALLY want it you can do sudo passwd
[04:38] <pianoboy3333> Can someone help me with printing?
[04:38] <Managu> Quartlow: which isn't found?  /dev/hda1 or /mnt?
[04:38] <itrebal> pianoboy3333: i'm in the same boat, i dont use Gnome and dont know the program to setup up printers :/
[04:39] <tagabasak_> Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
[04:39] <Managu> Quartlow: even better... what command did you decide on, exactly?
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
[04:39] <Managu> tagabasak_: well, yes, that's an option.  Though spending all ones time as the root user is generally considered poor practice.
[04:39] <Cueball|Laptop> Hi all. How can I kill a proccess that wont kill with kill -9 <PID>
[04:39] <eggzeck> itrebal, System->Administration->Printing (I believe)
[04:39] <mugzie> im so confused
[04:40] <itrebal> eggzeck: that would make sense if i used gnome, but i dont (which is hte issue)
[04:40] <dust> does anyone have any usb device/ipod knowledge that they could share?
[04:40] <eggzeck> itrebal, oh I'm so sorry, I didn't read up
[04:40] <Managu> mugzie: wine doesn't integrate incredibly well with the gui.  If that sort of integration is important, you might investigate commercial software like CrossoverOffice or Cedega
[04:40] <Quartlow> OK Mangu now I get  mount point media/hda1 does not exist
[04:41] <pianoboy3333> Can someone help me with printing?
[04:41] <mugzie> ok but i just wana know how to open the program i just installed aka paltalk
[04:41] <Managu> Quartlow: what command did you decide on?  Could you type it here, letter by letter?
[04:41] <jpe> how do you add a disk permanently via the disks manager?
[04:42] <Managu> mugzie: probably the easiest thing to do is (a) cd to it's installed directory, and (b) run its executable with "wine blah.exe".
[04:42] <itrebal> pianoboy3333: nobody can help if they don't know whats wrong
[04:42] <mugzie> ok it shows it installed
[04:42] <Managu> mugzie or possibly even using nautilus -- I think there's an association installed by default
[04:42] <theverant> are there no Gimp 2.3 packages in apt-get?
[04:42] <Zizou> does any body here runs xgl?
[04:42] <Managu> mugzie: what shows who installed, and how?
[04:42] <mugzie> managu im so confused what ur saying lol im so new to this
[04:42] <Quartlow> this one,,,sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 -o umask=777
[04:43] <dust> pianoboy3333: did you look in system-->admin-->printers
[04:43] <mugzie> in the maine menu of winetools i hit installed programs and it shows the program
[04:43] <itrebal> hell, i'll go into gnome :/
[04:43] <mugzie> all i wanna know is how can i open it is there a shortcut or what
[04:43] <Managu> mugzie: I'm probably not gonna be much help then, sorry.
[04:43] <Aphostile> Looking to install Ubuntu 5.10 on an old compaq PIII 500 with an odd notebook style CD-ROM CD-224E (Teac 24x).  Could someone advise what would be the best driver to use?  Generic is awful slow
[04:44] <Compuwiz> I am having an error on installation: "Failed to start the X server (your ghapical interface). It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagose the pronblem?" I have tried the command [sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg]  again to try re-configure and try different values, but nothing. The error happens on the page asking about the color depth, I tried the default of 24 and went all 
[04:44] <amphi> Aphostile: driver for what?
[04:44] <Managu> Quartlow: what happens when you try "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -o umask=777"
[04:44] <tulga> I not found sun's java SDK on dapper. I enabled multiverse, universe. howto install sun's java SDK?
[04:44] <Aphostile> CD-rom
[04:44] <amphi> Aphostile: is dma enabled?
[04:45] <Compuwiz> oh shit, wrong error
[04:45] <Quartlow> no error that time Managu!! just came back with a command line.
[04:45] <Managu> quartlow: If there's an error message, and you don't completely understand it, then copying the error message right down to the letter is important, as it is much more helpful for us to diagnose what's going on.
[04:45] <Aphostile> it's a dma device, yes.  I have not gone thru with the install yet because of the CD-Rom troubles with the live
[04:45] <Compuwiz> I am having an error on installation: "xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possible-customised configuration file" I have tried the command [sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg]  again to try re-configure and try different values, but nothing. The error happens on the page asking about the color depth, I tried the default of 24 and went all the way down to 8 bits and it still crashes. Any suggestions?
[04:45] <Compuwiz> there, that is the write error. my mistake
[04:46] <Managu> quartlow: ok, good.  From the menu at the top of the screen, go Places->Filesystem.  Look under the "mnt" folder
[04:46] <dust> so banshee will get the mp3 info from the ipod but be unable to play them and i can't eject the ipod, it only (improperly) unmounts. breezy (with banshee or gtkpod) is supposed to be able to deal with ipods
[04:47] <ricardo> does ati has problems with cedega?
[04:47] <Managu> Compuwiz: It would probably be quite helpful if you could pastebin, or otherwise give us all a copy of your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[04:47] <Quartlow> ok. its there, but when I click on it it tells me "you do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "mnt"
[04:47] <Managu> Compuwiz: I realize that might be a bit tricky when you lack a gui, of course.
[04:47] <amphi> Aphostile: you could google and see if there's a specific driver for it
[04:47] <Aphostile> Yeah I wasn't having much luck there
[04:48] <Compuwiz> haha, yeah I have no idea how to do that....
[04:48] <Managu> Quartlow: hrmm.  /bonk me, I got the command wrong.  "sudo umount /mnt"  and then "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -o umask=000"
[04:48] <Quartlow> LOL
[04:48] <Compuwiz> especially when my computer that im installing linux on isnt connected to any internet/network...
[04:48] <Centaur5> Hey amphi, care to know what fixed my wireless?
[04:48] <Managu> Compuwiz: oh?  Getting it connected to a network would definitely be helpful
[04:49] <Managu> Compuwiz: there really isn't enough information in the stuff you've pasted above to diagnose your problem
[04:49] <Compuwiz> haha, getting it installed would be a better step first
[04:49] <Compuwiz> uhm
[04:49] <Compuwiz> let me see if I can get more information
[04:49] <Managu> !tell compuwiz about flood
[04:49] <Quartlow> Good job Managu!!!!!!!!!
[04:50] <Managu> Quartlow: that task should be easier, and I'm not sure why there wasn't just an icon on your desktop to do all that
[04:50] <Managu> quartlow: but then, I'm only really an intermediate user
[04:50] <Aphostile> it seems like perhaps r*dh*t supports it but they suck
[04:50] <Quartlow> well I'm only a second time user, so you look like an expert to me
[04:51] <Quartlow> now I just have to write that command down
[04:51] <Compuwiz> haha thanks, I get a little [enter] happy online. here is a path it gives me for the file. /ect/X11/xorg.conf.#############
[04:51] <amphi> Aphostile: what's the problem, it's just a bit slow>
[04:51] <amphi> ?
[04:52] <SD> can anyone tell me why this command: "sudo tar zcvf backup myhomedir/ --exclude=myhomedir/.gconf" doesnt exclude correctly, but "sudo tar zcvf backup myhomedir/* --exclude=myhomedir/.gconf" (note the * after myhomedir) does?
[04:52] <jpe> is there any way to get the disks manager to add to /etc/fstab?
[04:52] <jpe> or should I just do it directly
[04:52] <rayston> can someone help me with a HD problem?
[04:52] <Aphostile> Well slow and the no eject thing but there is a program to solve that no?
[04:52] <Managu> Compuwiz: you want to look through /var/log/Xorg.0.log for lines that start with "(EE)".  One way to do that is to type "less /var/log/Xorg.0.log" and then press the keys [/]  [E]  [E]  [Enter] 
[04:53] <Aphostile> I am a bit of a Linux newbie... I had red hat installed once awhile back...  and i have worked with linux before so I'm not like totally clueless
[04:53] <Dr_Willis> :)
[04:53] <amphi> Aphostile: no eject>
[04:53] <amphi> ?
[04:54] <Dr_Willis> you have at least 'skimmed the manual' lol.
[04:54] <Aphostile> it won't eject the cds
[04:54] <Compuwiz> okay I will try that
[04:54] <Dr_Willis> if a program is accessing the cd they will be 'locked'
[04:54] <amphi> Aphostile: it won't eject a live cd (unless you use the cp to ramdisk option (if it has one))
[04:54] <Aphostile> Well I've been a unix computer operator for years so I do know a little
[04:54] <Dr_Willis> many live cds have a 'toram' option you can use at boot time.
[04:55] <Quartlow> Manago and psYchotic... Thanks for the help!!!!!!! Now I can play around some
[04:55] <Managu> Quartlow: have fun =)
[04:55] <Aphostile> ahh ok
[04:55] <Quartlow> oh i will
[04:55] <Aphostile> well i guess ill just go ahead with the slowness and work my way out... i have the sound card params
[04:55] <Aphostile> thanks
[04:55] <OPP> hi
[04:55] <OPP> i have a p3 1ghz 256 ram well breezy run fine?
[04:56] <Dr_Willis> should run 'ok'
[04:56] <Managu> OPP: might be a little slow in the graphics department, but otherwise should be fine.
[04:56] <amphi> Aphostile: once you have ubuntu installed, you may be able to tweak it
[04:56] <Dr_Willis> may want to use a light weight window manager.  (like xfce)
[04:56] <OPP> ya
[04:56] <OPP> i dont want to do games or anything
[04:56] <OPP> just like watch movies or play music
[04:56] <amphi> OPP: openbox is pleasant
[04:56] <OPP> openbox, is that a window manageR?

[05:00] <Compuwiz> Managu I found an EE on the log, its funny "No devices detected"........even though it automatically detected my card and it is listed in the log also. Is this due to the page where it asks me to locate the position of it like PCI location and such? Also, stupid question...I did what you said, and now I cannot exit out of that log?

[05:14] <mr_foamfingermak> no the pinapple will not fit all the way in...
[05:14] <linux_newbie2> XD
[05:14] <derek__> any1 can help me with installation of qt4?
[05:14] <Kyral> lol
[05:15] <orangey> specifically, there's a project relating to 'online learning software' that would be interesting to try to get some free software expertise on.
[05:15] <dli> tagabasak_, okay, " mkdir /mnt/hda2 && mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/hda2 "
[05:15] <Managu> tagabasak_: sorry, those wiki articles have much better info than I have
[05:15] <orangey> It seems the most likely candidate is Shuttleworth.. Is there some way to contact him directly?
[05:15] <orangey> Or should I just go to church, look up and speak directly ? : )
[05:15] <Cryptid> metalhedd, did u find any solution for my problem???
[05:15] <amphi> orangey: heh
[05:15] <orangey> mr_foamfingermak: hehehehe ; )

[05:15] <lowroad> I pulled an old hd that had windows xp loaded on it.  any idea on best way to extract the emails on thunderbird to my ubuntu thunderbird?
[05:15] <Managu> Compuwiz: ancient card, ehh?
[05:16] <orangey> amphi: To be honest, I wouldn't even ask, but when I wanted to talk to RMS about http://blogs.zmag.org (the blog for a large left publication that we were trying to take free software), I emailed him and he responded..
[05:16] <metalhedd> Cryptid, sudo apt-get update
[05:16] <metalhedd> with nothing else after update
[05:16] <tagabasak_> mdli, got it now
[05:17] <derek__> ny1 knows how to package python code?
[05:17] <tagabasak_> dli,got it now
[05:17] <Cryptid> metalhedd, i get this error when i execute that command http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14429
[05:17] <orangey> metalhedd: should we not encourage the use of synaptic for this?
[05:17] <dli> tagabasak_,  " chroot /mnt/hda2 /bin/bash --login "
[05:17] <amphi> orangey: it's worth a try, but I don't have his email addr
[05:17] <orangey> amphi: I can't really find an email address for him is the thing.
[05:17] <amphi> orangey: what happened with zmag?
[05:17] <orangey> any suggestions where I might find it?
[05:17] <metalhedd> orangey, synaptic doesn't give very useful error messages
[05:18] <orangey> amphi: blogs.z is now running drupal. The whole project is expected to go to free software by jan 1 2007.
[05:18] <tagabasak_> dli,done
[05:18] <amphi> orangey: google? (ie. no idea, sorry)
[05:18] <amphi> orangey: cool

[05:18] <dli> tagabasak_, check whether your /boot directory is okay, in the same terminal, " ls -l /boot/ "
[05:18] <derek__> hey does any1 know if executables created in linux can be executed in windows?
[05:19] <Cryptid> metalhedd, shit man i guess i will come back some other time i might get some help then
[05:19] <Cryptid> metalhedd, amphi bye
[05:19] <Managu> derek__: generally (almost always) the answer is "no"
[05:19] <tagabasak_> dli,  owner=root group=root
[05:19] <derek__> ok thx
[05:19] <dli> tagabasak_, what about files under /boot/ ?
[05:19] <lowroad> I pulled an old hd that had windows xp loaded on it.  any idea on best way to extract the emails on thunderbird to my ubuntu thunderbird?
[05:20] <cocox> how can i know the name of a .deb package for uninstall it ??, for example if i install once amsn and now i need to uninstall it, how can i know the complete name of the package ??
[05:20] <dli> tagabasak_, okay, " grub-install /dev/hda "
[05:20] <Dr_Willis> !apt-get
[05:20] <ubotu> [apt-get]  http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/apt-howto.en.txt (in depth) and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptGetHowto
[05:20] <Managu> cocox: alternately, you might use Synaptic to uninstall it
[05:21] <Managu> cocox: probably save you a bit of headache
[05:21] <orangey> bimberi: thank you. It seems like his email address is hard to come by, but perhaps I'll contact the shuttleworth foundation and see how that goes.
[05:21] <tagabasak_> dli,a second
[05:21] <cocox> Managu, but there is a way using script by console ??
[05:21] <Managu> cocox: sure.  That was what Dr_Willis offered, via ubotu.  Here's a repeat
[05:21] <Managu> !tell cocox about apt-get
[05:22] <bimberi> orangey: there are email addresses on that page (bottom left)
[05:22] <marcos_tux> hola
[05:22] <orangey> bimberi: aha! Thank you.
[05:22] <cocox> Managu, of course thnx but my question was in the beggining how can i know the name of the package that i installed once , plz be patient
[05:22] <lowroad> any idea on best way to extract the emails on thunderbird to my ubuntu thunderbird?
[05:22] <Managu> cocox: brief summary: use "apt-cache search blahpackagestiff" to get the package name (less any version info, dates, builds, etc), then "apt-get remove package name"

[05:23] <tagabasak_> history
[05:23] <cocox> Managu, i'll check this howto thank u !!
[05:23] <Managu> cocox: I suppose I don't understand.  If this is a one-time thing, why not just use the gui tools?
[05:24] <cocox> Managu, yes but i prefer to get involve with the console commands for use them anytime without a GUI
[05:25] <Managu> Cocox: *shrug* ok, as you like it.  Right tool for the job and all.
[05:25] <amphi> cocox: good on yer ;)
[05:26] <cocox> amphi, i didnt understand your phrase lol
[05:26] <amphi> cocox: no worries
[05:26] <cocox> Managu, thank u ;)

[05:27] <Managu> linux_newbie2: read the wiki howtos?
[05:27] <dli> tagabasak_, sorry, my fault
[05:27] <linux_newbie2> Managu: where?
[05:27] <dli> tagabasak_, " exit "
[05:27] <Managu> !tell linux_newbie2 about grub
[05:27] <tagabasak_> dli, ok
[05:28] <dli> tagabasak_, try again

[05:29] <floppyears> hi
[05:29] <vars> this when i try to burn a cd
[05:29] <floppyears> what version of python is installed in the ubuntu live cd ?
[05:29] <Managu> vars: I'd make a coaster out of it
[05:29] <Papageno> What's a good limewire client?
[05:30] <Madpilot> !limewire
[05:30] <ubotu> first you need !java, then download the http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and unpack it. Then just run the runLime.sh file. Voila. Consider !frostwire as an alternative.
[05:30] <Jeff1983> is there a way i can rip the audio tracks only from my dvd?
[05:30] <dli> tagabasak_,  and now, within chroot, " grub-install /dev/hda "
[05:30] <floppyears> anybody who knows what python version is installed in the live cd ?
[05:30] <|Sivik|> how do i tell if a firewall is up or not
[05:30] <lowroad> I pulled an old hd that had windows xp loaded on it.  any idea on best way to extract the emails on thunderbird to my ubuntu thunderbird?
[05:30] <tagabasak_> dli, do i have to make direcory proc on my dev/hda2?
[05:30] <bimberi> floppyears: pretty sure it's 2.4
[05:30] <Papageno> Madpilot: Is there no KDE limewire client? Or any Linux native client?
[05:31] <vars> Managu, anyway to stop making coasters?
[05:31] <dli> tagabasak_, you should have " /mnt/hda2/proc " already
[05:31] <floppyears> thanks bimberi
[05:31] <Madpilot> Papageno, no idea, I don't run the thing myself
[05:31] <bimberi> floppyears: np :)
[05:31] <Managu> vars: slow machine?
[05:31] <Managu> vars: or old/cheap cd-writer?
[05:31] <vars> i don't think so it has burned before
[05:31] <vars> yeah old cd-r
[05:31] <vars> haven't used it in a while
[05:31] <tagabasak_> dli, too bad i dont have =(
[05:32] <tagabasak_> dli, why i dnt have that directory?
[05:32] <dli> tagabasak_, mkdir
[05:32] <Managu> vars: No specific details, but it looks like your system can't take building the iso image and burning it simultaneously.  Things might work better if you did those seperately
[05:32] <vars> humm
[05:32] <vars> thanks
[05:32] <Papageno> !frostwire
[05:32] <mikebot> how can i screen capture in mplayer?
[05:32] <ubotu> methinks frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
[05:33] <dli> mikebot, run mplayer like, "mplayer -vo x11 "
[05:33] <orangey> I have to ask.. where does this "OMG PONIES" inside joke come from?
[05:34] <vars> orangey, have you ever been around a 6 year lod girl?
[05:34] <orangey> lod?
[05:34] <Managu> =old
[05:34] <orangey> Ok. so they like ponies..
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> Untill they see how dirty the things are.
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> :P
[05:35] <orangey> It's not new as I can recall from my childhood. how did we get involved?
[05:35] <mikebot> dli, sorry?
[05:35] <vars> Managu, no dice
[05:36] <vars> i tried to burn from a iso
[05:36] <Managu> vars: are the HD and the CD-R on the same IDE controller?
[05:36] <tagabasak_> dli, what do you mean by within chroot?
[05:36] <mugzie> how would i open the home directory in the terminal?
[05:36] <dli> tagabasak_, after the command chroot
[05:36] <vars> it's a laptop so i think so
[05:36] <tagabasak_> dli,ok
[05:36] <|Sivik|> how do i tell if a firewall is up or not
[05:37] <|Sivik|> i'm trying to ssh in and it says the connection is refused
[05:37] <warren__> Hello everyone, I am kinda new (totally actually) to linux, I am looking for some assistance in setting up a LVM share, so I can place my cross platform media onto one machine, would anyone mind feilding a few questions?
[05:37] <vars> mugzie, open a term an hit ls
[05:37] <Managu> vars: I'm a bit confused -- you certainly get a different error, no?  mkisofs shouldn't be involved at all
[05:37] <|Sivik|> !ssh
[05:37] <ubotu> ssh is, like, totally, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SSHHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdvancedOpenSSH
[05:37] <vars> i got that error once
[05:37] <tagabasak_> dli,it say cannot change root directory to grub-install
[05:37] <vars> so the mkisofs what does that refer to?
[05:38] <lendyl> help
[05:38] <Managu> vars: mkisofs is a program which creates an .iso image from a bunch of files
[05:38] <warren__> I have two SATA 300 GB Drives,  I want to make the empty space ( / )on the SDA and the whole new SDB drive span together into one big 500GB volume, so iTunes enjoys the placement of a single folder
[05:38] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, most likely you don't have an ssh server installed
[05:38] <Managu> vars: literally "make ISO filesystem"
[05:38] <warren__> Since my SDB is empty, should I make the 8E a primary or a Logical partition?
[05:38] <mugzie> i pressed ls but i dont get the pop up i wanna delete somthing in there
[05:38] <HellDragonWeird> im weird
[05:38] <amphi> vars: to burn an iso, just do cdrecord foo.iso (assuming /etc/default/cdrecord is correct)
[05:38] <|Sivik|> eggzeck: ok
[05:39] <vars> ok
[05:39] <mugzie> how would i do that get the home to open in a window? in terminal
[05:39] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[05:39] <Managu> mugzie: how bout Places -> home
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> no, im weird im weird
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> i ate one of my keyboard
[05:39] <Taru> How do I install frostwire ?
[05:39] <dli> tagabasak_, can you run " grub ", instead ?
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> im weird
[05:39] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, once that's done, you should be able to ssh into the box. :)
[05:39] <lendyl> where can i find a technical help for ubuntu?
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> i ate one of my keyboard key
[05:39] <bimberi> !frostwire
[05:39] <ubotu> it has been said that frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
[05:39] <|Sivik|> k
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> the number between 3 and 5
[05:39] <HellDragonWeird> im weird
[05:39] <Managu> mugzie: if you really are averse to using the mouse, you can open the menus with alt-f1
[05:39] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I looked over those wiki help pages, but the I'm not sure which steps to use.  I've removed GRUB from the MBR and don't have Ubuntu installed on any partition, although I have partitions for it set up.  I am currently on a Knoppix live CD
[05:39] <Taru> Thank you ^^
[05:39] <|Sivik|> eggzeck, i knew i was missing something, but i couldn't remember
[05:40] <HellDragonWeird> im weir dim weirdir mei rwmiwmdi wmdiwe
[05:40] <tagabasak_> dli, im on grub now
[05:40] <vars> amphi,  well that gave me some new errors   9 cdrecord  fo.iso
[05:40] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, hehe, cool. I sometimes forget things too. :)
[05:40] <mugzie> no managu i have to do it through terminal cause im on ice lite
[05:40] <|Sivik|> eggzeck, thanks a bunch
[05:40] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, you're welcome.
[05:40] <Managu> mugzie: hrmm.  "nautilus &" , perhaps
[05:40] <lendyl> amphi, where could i find technical help for ubuntu?
[05:41] <|Sivik|> eggzeck, its now saying that the host key verification failed
[05:41] <warren__> Empty Secondary hard drive, and I am making it one big partition to add to my LVM, do I want to make it a primary or logical partition???
[05:41] <amphi> lendyl: what do you mean? you could ask in the channel...
[05:41] <disinterseted_pe> has anyone here successfully got windows media to play in ubuntu?
[05:41] <Madpilot> lendyl, here, or at help.ubuntu.com, or wiki.ubuntu.com, or at System->Help...
[05:41] <Managu> linux_newbie2: actually, dli and tagabasak_ are tackling a very, very similar problem.  You might want to scroll back and look at some of their conversation
[05:41] <eggzeck> |Sivik|, and then?
[05:41] <lendyl> ahhh... ok
[05:41] <|Sivik|> it goes back to the #
[05:41] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, wmv & wma files? of course.
[05:41] <tagabasak_> dli,what should i do next?
[05:42] <Managu> linux_newbie2: oh, wait.  Hold on, I'm confused
[05:42] <disinterseted_pe> ok what packages do i need to install for them?
[05:42] <dli> tagabasak_, within grub ?
[05:42] <Managu> linux_newbie2: what is it you're trying to accomplish?
[05:42] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell disinterseted_pe about restricted
[05:42] <tagabasak_> dli,yup
[05:42] <vars> amph cd record is looking for a -scsi   and telling me that thje 2.6 kernal hates it
[05:42] <|Sivik|> eggzeck, it talks about some crap about "IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY" and a bunch of other crap and then says Host key verification failed
[05:42] <dli> tagabasak_, " find /etc/hosts "
[05:42] <amphi> vars: it's scsi or ide?
[05:43] <dli> tagabasak_, we want to double check, it's hd0
[05:43] <vars> ide
[05:43] <linux_newbie2> Managu: the only OS I have set up successfully right now is Windows...I am just trying to get the MBR back in order so I can get into it, for starters
[05:43] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> ssh ?
[05:43] <disinterseted_pe> ive been there
[05:43] <vars> in a gateway laptop i am 100% sure that is ide right
[05:43] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, yes
[05:43] <linux_newbie2> Managu: then I have to figure out why Ubuntu won't install :P
[05:43] <Managu> linux_newbie2: have a Windows boot disk?
[05:43] <amphi> vars: do cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
[05:43] <linux_newbie2> Managu: yes
[05:43] <tagabasak_> dli,file not found
[05:43] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
[05:43] <dli> tagabasak_, you didn't typo ?
[05:43] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, see the w32codecs info on that RestrictedFormats site
[05:43] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I tried fixboot and fixmbr and it can't boot the os
[05:44] <Managu> linux_newbie2: I knew what to do with windows9x; I don't know how windows2k+ work.
[05:44] <tagabasak_> dli, what is typo?
[05:44] <dli> tagabasak_, maybe, " find /boot/grub/menu.lst "
[05:44] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, and then try ssh again?
[05:44] <tagabasak_> dli, sorry im really a newbie
[05:44] <Managu> linux_newbie2: but, honestly, the problem isn't a linux problem.  You need to reinstall the windows MBR
[05:44] <disinterseted_pe> ok ty
[05:44] <amphi> vars: take the number and put a line in /etc/default/cdrecord like CRD_DEVICE=ATA:1,0,0 where the '1,0,0' are the numbers that command shows you
[05:44] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> yep
[05:44] <Mr> is this where yuo can go for help?
[05:44] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, same thing
[05:44] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I agree
[05:44] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> run the command on the client, not the server
[05:44] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I thought maybe I could get GRUB back up and use that though
[05:45] <amphi> vars: then you won't need to specify the device to cdrecord every time
[05:45] <linux_newbie2> Managu: since it used to work before I screwed up my linux partition
[05:45] <Managu> linux_newbie2: hrmm, I suppose that's a possibility.
[05:45] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, already doing that, can a server not be a client for something else?
[05:45] <Mr> IS this where you go for help?
[05:45] <tagabasak_> dli, w8 did you mean that i should be on grub prompt?
[05:45] <Managu> linux_newbie2: lemme see
[05:45] <Taru> ubotu, sudo dpkg -i FrostWire-4.10.9-1.i586.deb, will not work why?
[05:45] <|Sivik|> let me try something
[05:45] <ubotu> Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Taru
[05:45] <Madpilot> Mr, it is - just ask a question, don't ask to ask
[05:45] <dli> tagabasak_, yes, within grub
[05:46] <micker> how do you "upgrade" releases?
[05:46] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> I doubt it, funny though, whenever I get that message, deleting known_hosts does the trick
[05:46] <Madpilot> Taru, ubotu is a bot...
[05:46] <Managu> linux_newbie2: from a root command line, how bout you run "grub"
[05:46] <atoponce> Mr: depends on the help
[05:46] <tagabasak_> grub
[05:46] <Managu> linux_newbie2 (and pray that knoppix has grub)
[05:46] <poimen> gnome- and XGL rulez in ubuntu
[05:46] <poimen> :)
[05:46] <linux_newbie2> Managu: done
[05:46] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, i have ssh server installed on this machine as well as the laptop and i can log in from the desktop to the laptop but not the laptop to the desktop
[05:46] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, i get that error
[05:46] <poimen> I used gnome and xgl in suse and in ubuntu is better starnge maybe bacause we use gnome 2.14
[05:46] <Taru> ubotu, Thank you ^^
[05:46] <ubotu> no problem, Taru
[05:47] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, can you tell me the right repo needed to install mplayer?
[05:47] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> tried running the command on both ?
[05:47] <tagabasak_> dli, still not found =(
[05:47] <Managu> linux_newbie2: put it on your hard drive.  It's been a while since I did this, so I might not be remembering the incantations correctly.  Also keep in mind that we're in data-loss mode, so things could get better or they could get worse
[05:47] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, no
[05:47] <Mr> Atopounce: i am having problems getting my display to work properly

[05:47] <HymnToLife> my bad, it's multiverse

[05:48] <linux_newbie2> Managu: Error 12: Invalid device requested
[05:48] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> it should be in your sources.list, just uncomment the lenes mentioning it
[05:48] <linux_newbie2> Managu: is it setup (hd0, 0)?

I have to use the --ignore-depends option, as in  "dpkg --ignore-depends=kdelibs4c2 -i /boxln/root/apt/archives/krusader_1.70.0-0kubuntu1_i386.deb" to get it to ignore the dependency problem.  But every time I try to install something else, apt-get tries to get rid of krusader.  What can I do to tell apt-get to continue ignor

[05:49] <pppoe_dude> hi. anyone knows of a good anime wallpaper site? something that compares to www.sexydesktop.co.uk?
[05:49] <Managu> linux_newbie2: that would wipe out your windows partition's boot sector, and you'd be back at reinstalling from there
[05:49] <pppoe_dude> sorry i guess this belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic... nm
[05:49] <Dr_Willis> pppoe_dude,  :P you pervert. :P
[05:49] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> what happens when you sudo apt-get install mplayer-586 ?

[05:50] <Mr> The resolution is at 640 X 400, its a 19" LCD capable of 1280 X 1040; i tried changing it through the settings (only 640X400 was avaliable) and i edited the xorg.conf file deleting all but 1280 X 1040

[05:50] <atoponce> Mr: have you tried 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'?
[05:51] <pppoe_dude> Mr, sounds like a driver problem or a video-bios related problem
[05:51] <Managu> linux_newbie2: err, guess it's "grub-install /dev/hda"

[05:55] <feryana> hi there
[05:55] <tagabasak_> dli, yep
[05:55] <feryana> i need some help because i'm getting mad
[05:56] <Managu> linux_newbie2:  The documentation I'm seeing doesn't really suggest a cure using grub
[05:56] <feryana> for me is impossible install a tar.gz
[05:56] <feryana> i do all good
[05:56] <Managu> linux_newbie2: tell me, what happens when you try to boot your machine now?
[05:56] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> pastebin your new sources.list please
[05:56] <feryana> but ./configure doesnt work
[05:56] <Mr> atoponce: how would i be able to tell that
[05:56] <mugzie> anyone?
[05:56] <mugzie> know
[05:56] <dli> tagabasak_, okay, in the previous terminal, in grub, " root (hd0,1) "
[05:56] <mugzie> im so confused
[05:56] <linux_newbie2> Managu: It says could not boot the operating system
[05:56] <amphi> feryana: why are you installing from source
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> how do i unmount?
[05:57] <feryana> I want to install some dictionaries for open office and is a tar.gz
[05:57] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14432
[05:57] <feryana> then i went to konsole entered the directory
[05:57] <|Sivik|> MorbidHunger, umount /dev/devicenumber
[05:57] <amphi> MorbidHunger: umount
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> ok
[05:57] <feryana> but when I tipe ./configure
[05:57] <yuheng108> what is PQserivecs root?
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> just umount?
[05:57] <amphi> MorbidHunger: or umount /mount/point
[05:57] <feryana> says me no file or directory
[05:57] <amphi> MorbidHunger: umount, not unmount
[05:57] <Managu> linux_newbie2: this is going to sound silly, but I think you want to try reinstalling ubuntu
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> ok
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> thanx mate
[05:57] <tagabasak_> dli, file system is ext2fs
[05:57] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, whats wrong
[05:58] <atoponce> Mr: not sure how to 'see' what driver without reconfiguring the xserver
[05:58] <Managu> linux_newbie2: at the least, you'll probably get grub back
[05:58] <amphi> MorbidHunger: that bug is fixed in plan 9 ;)
[05:58] <Mr> hmmm
[05:58] <dli> tagabasak_, now, " setup (hd0) "
[05:58] <RemyLaptop> hi guys, can anyone provide any information on setting my laptop up to dual-boot ubuntu and windows?
[05:58] <linux_newbie2> Managu: well, I have tried twice, with a Ubuntu CD I DLed today and with an Edubuntu 5.10 CD that has worked on other machines
[05:58] <|Sivik|> RamyLaptop: did you install windows first and then ubuntu?
[05:58] <linux_newbie2> Managu: they both fail when installing the base system :(
[05:58] <Mr> well i have booted from the live CD and the resolution was fine
[05:58] <tagabasak_> dli,done
[05:58] <dli> tagabasak_, make sure grub was run right after "chroot"
[05:58] <|Sivik|> RemyLaptop, did you install windows and then ubuntu?
[05:58] <tagabasak_> dli, is houl rebbot?
[05:59] <dli> tagabasak_, " quit "
[05:59] <feryana> so then, how I install a tar.gz???????? what I must do
[05:59] <dli> tagabasak_, " exit "
[05:59] <Apostle^> linux_newbie2, sounds like your HD is not clean
[05:59] <Managu> linux_newbie2: when you try to boot, do you get anything other than a generic "could not load operating system" message?  Anything at all?  Does GRUB say soemthing?  Is there a disk error?
[05:59] <linux_newbie2> ManaguL: running the CD check says they both have a problem with a file on the disk, but I know the edubuntu one has worked on another machine
[05:59] <atoponce> Mr: what version+
[05:59] <Apostle^> linux_newbie2, try formatting it clean
[05:59] <RemyLaptop> |Sivik| - I currently have ubuntu installed ( an no spare partitions), but i'm planning on going again completely from scratch...
[05:59] <dli> tagabasak_, you may reboot now
[05:59] <atoponce> ?
[05:59] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> I cn't see what's wrong, here's my sources.list if you want : http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/sources.list
[05:59] <Mr> 5.10
[05:59] <tagabasak_> dli, ok
[05:59] <Deedubb> when is dapper going to be released?
[05:59] <Mr> some one i installed it from
[05:59] <MorbidHunger> never
[05:59] <Apostle^> !dapper
[05:59] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[05:59] <Mr> i had the live DVD
[05:59] <atoponce> Deedubb: june 1st
[05:59] <|Sivik|> RemyLaptop, so you don't currently have windows installed?
[05:59] <feryana> because i see how to do it on the sites... but ./configure never work
[05:59] <linux_newbie2> Managu: before I did the fixmbr from the windows disk, GRUB gave an error 15
[05:59] <Deedubb> thank you
[06:00] <RemyLaptop> |Sivik| - no
[06:00] <Managu> linux_newbie2: oi, I remember error 15
[06:00] <tagabasak_> dli,hope it works *__*
[06:00] <sponix> whoever does the ubotu bot, it should be "then" for the last word of that dapper statement ;)
[06:00] <Managu> linux_newbie2: lemme see.  Maybe lilo would be more useful to you here.  It's a lot less testy on install
[06:00] <MorbidHunger> how long does it take to mount an image?
[06:00] <linux_newbie2> Managu: fine by me
[06:00] <mikebot> how can i screen capture in mplayer?
[06:00] <amphi> feryana: why are you trying to compile from source?
[06:00] <Apostle^> Managu, lilo is not used with ubuntu
[06:00] <feryana> yep
[06:00] <NytShade> Anyone willing to help me out with a samba woe?
[06:00] <|Sivik|> RemyLaptop, its eastist to install windows and then install ubuntu: the ubuntu grub will find the windows partition
[06:00] <amphi> mikebot: just a frame?
[06:01] <|Sivik|> NytShade, whast the problem
[06:01] <feryana> i want to make a deb or something installable
[06:01] <mikebot> amphi, yeah
[06:01] <Managu> Apostle^: fair enough, also not particularly relivant to our discussion ;-)
[06:01] <RemyLaptop> !grub
[06:01] <ubotu> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
[06:01] <amphi> mikebot: use the x11 driver
[06:01] <linux_newbie2> Apostle: at this point I just want to get back to windows before I give Ubuntu another shot
[06:01] <RemyLaptop> thanks |Sivik|
[06:01] <amphi> mikebot: and then whatever you like, gimp for example
[06:01] <Jeff1983> i purchased some tv shows on dvd. i'd like to rip the commentary tracks only (i.e. no video) is there a way to do this?
[06:01] <carthik> feryana, the question is, why are you doing that? isn't what you need in the ubuntu repositories?
[06:01] <mikebot> amphi, someone told me to do "mplayer -vo x11", but i don't know whatto doa fter that
[06:01] <vars> feryana, dpkg -i yourdebher.deb
[06:01] <Apostle^> Managu, i tell you this because if the person were to install lilo and then updated their kernel they would not have a working system
[06:01] <NytShade> I've installed it and SWAT, but when I log into swat it doesn't give me any configuration options. As though I'm a guest.
[06:01] <amphi> mikebot: yes, that's what I'm saying
[06:01] <feryana> is a software unmounted on tar.gaz and i want to run that software
[06:01] <Mr> Hey there
[06:01] <RemyLaptop> another question, I've plugged in an external HDD, and it's recognised it, but as read only... how can I make it so I can write to it ?
[06:02] <mikebot> amphi, but when i type that, it just gives me a list of commands...then what do i do?
[06:02] <carthik> feryana, what software is that?
[06:02] <atoponce> Mr: try the vesa driver, althogh you won't be able to do anything graphic intensive
[06:02] <feryana> ooodi-0.68-i686-linux.tar.gz
[06:02] <amphi> mikebot: mplayer -vo x11 whatever
[06:02] <feryana> is a installed for dictionaries for open office
[06:02] <Managu> Apostle^: indeed, I'm somewhat familiar with the difference
[06:02] <Mr> how would i do that
[06:02] <feryana> i've downloaded like that
[06:02] <amphi> feryana: is there not a package for that?
[06:02] <mikebot> amphi, i understand typing "mplayer -vo x11" in terminal...but now how do i get the screen i want into a jpg?
[06:02] <feryana> nop... just that file
[06:02] <Managu> linux_newbie2: lemme see.  Is there an /etc/lilo.conf on your current system?
[06:03] <Dr_Willis> NytShade,  the ubuntu packagtes proberly have it 'locked down' for security reasons - check the wiki/forums for what needs to be done to reenable full use of it.
[06:03] <NytShade> |Sivik|, can you help?
[06:03] <tagabasak_> dli,  yey got it now, i just have to edit my menu.lst  t_T
[06:03] <atoponce> 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[06:03] <feryana> I just what to install some spelling dictionaries for open office

[06:04] <feryana> i've installed the build-essential
[06:04] <feryana> but i can't do more
[06:04] <mikebot> amphi, how in gimp..that's what i'm asking
[06:04] <linux_newbie2> Managu: yes
[06:04] <amphi> feryana: are the dictionaries not packaged?
[06:04] <Managu> linux_newbie2: oh, good.  Can you pastebin a copy for me ot look at?

[06:05] <feryana> i just finded that one

[06:05] <mikebot> amphi thank you
[06:05] <tagabasak_> dli,why im on Busybox
[06:05] <kbrosnan> the monday after that
[06:05] <Managu> mathieu_: monday week is when Memorial Day is observed in the US
[06:05] <amphi> Managu: what is remembered?
[06:06] <kbrosnan> 29th of May
[06:06] <feryana> the veterans amphi
[06:06] <tagabasak_> dli,it stops loading and promptind BusyBox
[06:06] <amphi> feryana: ah
[06:06] <Managu> amphi: That's a good question.  Like an idiot, I don't know the history of Memorial Day
[06:06] <vars> yeah that is when will celebrate that we won the war
[06:07] <|Sivik|> NytShade, not really
[06:07] <linux_newbie2> Managu: uh, having some kind of clipboard issue, it won't paste into the box :P
[06:07] <|Sivik|> mathieu, no
[06:07] <feryana> so then, there is no way to install or pack a tar.gz file?
[06:07] <|Sivik|> mathieu, its next monday we have a holiday
[06:07] <amphi> feryana: tar zxvf foo.tgz
[06:07] <linux_newbie2> Managu: nm
[06:07] <RemyLaptop> another question, I've plugged in an external HDD, and it's recognised it, but as read only... how can I make it so I can write to it ?
[06:07] <ray_> i have a radeon 7200 and i'm trying to get my monitor to display on tv? any help?
[06:07] <Managu> linux_newbie2: heh
[06:07] <|Sivik|> NytShade, are you trying to get files from a windows box to a linux box?
[06:07] <MorbidHunger> for somereason its not mounted
[06:07] <MorbidHunger> i shall intalld daemon tools
[06:07] <linux_newbie2> Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14433
[06:08] <|Sivik|> ray_: have fun, ati is a bitch in linux
[06:08] <linux_newbie2> Managu: Edit->Paste didn't work, but middle-click does...ok...
[06:08] <ray_> boy oh boy
[06:08] <ray_> not too good to hear...
[06:08] <Managu> linux_newbie2: sec, reading
[06:08] <NytShade> |Sivik|, I'm setting up this ubuntu box as a testbed and a fileserver. I'd like to get it working as a fileserver before the end of the night :)
[06:08] <feryana> and what I must do with the files?
[06:09] <feryana> there is one oooodi.install
[06:09] <feryana> and others
[06:09] <|Sivik|> NytShade, so your trying to access the files from the ubuntu box to the windows box?
[06:09] <tagabasak_> dli, i got an alert it says that /dev/hdc2 doesnt exist. dorping to a shell
[06:09] <amphi> ray_: OTOH, that's an old card, so it should be well supported - radeontool might be of use to you
[06:09] <ray_> radeontool?
[06:09] <feryana> what I do with that?
[06:09] <amphi> ray_: radeontool
[06:09] <dli> tagabasak_, it's /dev/hda2
[06:09] <ray_> a channel?
[06:10] <tagabasak_> dli, what shoul i do?
[06:10] <pppoe_dude> how can i change vncserver's default window manager? i.e. switch from gnome to kde
[06:10] <NytShade> |Sivik|, and vice versa.
[06:10] <amphi> ray_: no, a program - it's packaged; apt-cache show radeontool
[06:10] <dli> tagabasak_, you can type 'e' to edit grub entries
[06:10] <Managu> linux_newbie2: add to the end 2 lines: "other=/dev/hda1" and "label=windows"
[06:11] <|Sivik|> NytShade, to get files off of the ubuntu box, use a scp program in windows
[06:11] <amphi> ray_: actually, it has nothing to do with tv out, sorry ;)
[06:11] <Managu> linux_newbie2: then run "lilo" as root
[06:11] <ray_> heh, ok then
[06:11] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I believe my windows is on hda2
[06:11] <Managu> linux_newbie2: oh?  What's on hda1?
[06:11] <|Sivik|> NytShade, and in ubuntu, make sure the windows firewall is off and then you should be able to use samba
[06:11] <linux_newbie2> Managu: I think GRUB lived there?  It's a small partition
[06:11] <tagabasak_> dli,it stops loading, i cant login to gui.. becaus of the alerts. im on a shell now.
[06:12] <amphi> ray_: atitvout might be useful
[06:12] <Managu> linux_newbie2: you can run "fdisk -l" to be sure who's what, but if windows is on /dev/hda2, that's what you want in the "other" field
[06:12] <dli> tagabasak_, reboot, change in grub
[06:12] <NytShade> |Sivik|, not using any firewall software on any of the pc's in the home's network.
[06:12] <|Sivik|> NytShade, yes, but is the normal windows firewall on?
[06:12] <amphi> ray_: that's what I was thinking of
[06:12] <NytShade> |Sivik|, No
[06:12] <MorbidHunger> u guys know how to unrar something
[06:12] <ray_> thanks, amphi
[06:12] <kelvie> where are the ipw2200 drivers located
[06:13] <tagabasak_> dli, how could i do that?
[06:13] <DBO> !tell MorbidHunger about rar
[06:13] <KaosX> windows fw only blocks/monitors incoming connections
[06:13] <|Sivik|> NytShade, thats weird
[06:13] <amphi> kelvie: ipw2200.sf.net
[06:13] <ray_> here's a simple question hopefully
[06:13] <kelvie> are they not in synaptic?
[06:13] <dli> tagabasak_, boot livecd
[06:13] <feryana> amphi what I must do with the files inside ?
[06:13] <linux_newbie2> Managu: yeah, windows is on hda2
[06:13] <amphi> feryana: I have no idea
[06:13] <NytShade> |Sivik|, how so? I shut it off ages ago.
[06:13] <|Sivik|> KaosX, yes i know that, but hes trying to access the windows files from samba on the ubuntu box
[06:13] <tagabasak_> dli,ok T_T
[06:13] <|Sivik|> NytShade, i didn't say it was on
[06:13] <ray_> how do I keep my second hard drive (hdb1) mounted each time i reboot
[06:13] <|Sivik|> NytShade, i just asked if it was on
[06:13] <amphi> kelvie: they're in the install IIRC - modprobe ipw2200 should work
[06:14] <DBO> ray_, you have to put an entry in /etc/fstab
[06:14] <Rug> ray_: edit /etc/fstab
[06:14] <amphi> ray_: stick it in fstab
[06:14] <|Sivik|> NytShade, when you run samba, it should see the mshome network
[06:14] <Rug> =) damn beat me to it
[06:14] <DBO> Rug, i love you too
[06:14] <raven> does anyone know if gentoo or actually kororaa have a synaptic type package system to install packages?
[06:14] <Rug> DBO: but atleast we are better then amphi
[06:14] <Managu> linux_newbie2: bit after my bedtime here, so I'm gonna be going shortly
[06:14] <|Sivik|> NytShade, or whatever you currently have it named as long as your have the same network address and the same subnet mask for both computers
[06:14] <ojai> anyone know of any problems or issues running Dapper on an Opteron?
[06:14] <amphi> Rug: much ;) but then I'm on rural dialup
[06:15] <|Sivik|> ojai: go to #ubuntu+1
[06:15] <Rug> nice excuse.
[06:15] <|Sivik|> ojai: thats the dapper help channel
[06:15] <|Sivik|> !dapper
[06:15] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[06:15] <HymnToLife> amphi> join the club :)
[06:15] <linux_newbie2> Managu: /proc/misc: No entry for device-mapper found
[06:15] <ojai> Sivik: Yeah, already asked there -- not much feedback :)
[06:15] <amphi> Rug: excuse, perhaps, but hardly 'nice'
[06:15] <Rug> I have never heard of dialup lag affecting IRC
[06:15] <amphi> HymnToLife: ;)
[06:15] <MorbidHunger> still having trouble mounting
[06:15] <linux_newbie2> Managu: /dev/mapper/control: open failed: No suck device
[06:15] <amphi> Rug: it does if you do anything else
[06:15] <linux_newbie2> *such
[06:15] <disinterseted_pe> so exactly what do i need to do to play windows media on ubuntu?
[06:16] <Blue89> lol
[06:16] <linux_newbie2> Managu: Warning: '/proc/partitions' does nto match '/dev' directory structure
[06:16] <Managu> linux_newbie2: what's at the end?
[06:16] <ray_> now, just to be sure... it should be /dev/hdb1 and not /dev/hdb?
[06:16] <NytShade> |Sivik|, they are both on the same workgroup and subnet.
[06:16] <RemyLaptop> does anybody have any ideas ?
[06:17] <linux_newbie2> Managu: Fatal: Trying to map files from unnamed device 0x000e (NFS/RAID mirror down?)
[06:17] <Rug> ray_: yes
[06:17] <ray_> thanks, rug
[06:17] <ray_> you guys are awesome
[06:17] <Rug> Take that back!
[06:17] <Managu> linux_newbie2: ok, well, seems that didn't work.  And I'm out of ideas.  Got that backup of your windows partition handy?
[06:17] <amphi> Rug: heh, I still have an old motorola 14.4 pcmcia modem somewhere
[06:17] <Rug> I am not!!!!
[06:17] <ray_> ha
[06:17] <linux_newbie2> Managu: oy
[06:18] <whereeee> hi
[06:18] <|Sivik|> NytShade, just because they have the same subnet doesn't mean they are on the same network
[06:18] <Rug> amphi: My first modem was a 300/1200 Switchable MANUAL "Pocket Modem" for the C64
[06:18] <whereeee> where can I get a spanish dictionary for openoffice
[06:18] <Rug> I ran a BBS on that thing
[06:18] <|Sivik|> NytShade, you have to verify that the network portion of the ip address's are the same
[06:18] <|Sivik|> like the same probably first 3 parts of the ip address
[06:19] <|Sivik|> NytShade, are you using a external ip and an internal ip?
[06:19] <mugzie> grr im so confused
[06:19] <rak_> does ubuntu only support 1024X768 or is my graphics card not installed properly?
[06:19] <amphi> Rug: manual? acoustic coupler? ;)
[06:19] <|Sivik|> rak_: you probably dont' have it install correctly
[06:19] <linux_newbie2> Managu: would the window bootloader be having issues because the windows parition is not first?
[06:19] <Rug> You would dial the number with the telephone in your hand, and when the other end picked up, you switched on the modem and entered ATA+ in the term
[06:19] <|Sivik|> linux_newbie2, shouldn't
[06:19] <Managu> linux_newbie2: the things we've tried have kept running into the fact that linux doesn't know the mapping from bios drive numbers to logical drive numbers.  Solving that might help.  You might also try using cfdisk to make sure that the windows partition is set "active" or "Bootable", or something
[06:19] <Rug> amphi: not quite that bad, but VERY close!
[06:19] <amphi> heh
[06:19] <MorbidHunger> is there any other way to mount cd images?
[06:19] <tagabasak_> dli, what should i do now?
[06:20] <linux_newbie2> Managu: ah, it is not!
[06:20] <amphi> MorbidHunger: mount -o loop -t iso9660 foo.iso /mount/point
[06:20] <Rug> ray_: yes it does support it.
[06:20] <linux_newbie2> Managu: the linux partition is set as boot
[06:20] <whereeee> Where can I download a spanish dictionary for openoffice????????????
[06:20] <NytShade> |Sivik|, they are both using addresses assigned by the router's DHCP service.
[06:20] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, can you repost the url for your current soucres.list
[06:20] <Managu> linux_newbie2: should be an easy fix
[06:20] <MorbidHunger> thats not working
[06:20] <|Sivik|> NytShade, then they should be on the same network
[06:20] <dli> tagabasak_, correct your /etc/fstab /boot/grub/menu.lst on hdd
[06:20] <|Sivik|> NytShade, are you running the GUI for samba?
[06:20] <linux_newbie2> Managu: should I unmark the Linux partition as bootable as well?
[06:20] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/sources.list
[06:21] <NytShade> |Sivik|, there is a gui?
[06:21] <Rug> ray_: edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and input the resolutions you want.
[06:21] <Managu> linux_newbie2: yup.  Though I don't think you can have 2 bootable partitions (I could well be wrong)
[06:21] <ray_> rug, i almost missed that.
[06:21] <amphi> MorbidHunger: that is the way to do it; perhaps the image is corrupt? what does 'file whatever.iso' say?
[06:21] <tagabasak_> dli,do i have to mount again?
[06:21] <|Sivik|> NytShade, are you trying ti run samba in command line?
[06:21] <pppoe_dude> how can i start a vnc session with kde as a wm instead of gnome
[06:21] <ray_> atitvout supports radeon 7200?
[06:21] <nathansnook> It seems that ubuntu is a little slow is there any way to speed this system up?
[06:21] <dli> tagabasak_, yes
[06:21] <KaosX> thats why its easier to tie samba to an interface rather than a network
[06:21] <NytShade> I belive so, yes.
[06:21] <amphi> ray_: maybe ;)
[06:21] <NytShade> |Sivik|, I belive so, yes.
[06:21] <Managu> nathansnook: define slow.  (slow, how?).  There might be a way to address your issue
[06:21] <ray_> okay, i'm about to install it
[06:21] <MorbidHunger> sage: mount -V                 : print version
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount -h                 : print this help
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount                    : list mounted filesystems
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount -l                 : idem, including volume labels
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> So far the informational part. Next the mounting.
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> The command is `mount [-t fstype]  something somewhere'.
[06:22] <|Sivik|> NytShade, thats the hard way to do it
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> Details found in /etc/fstab may be omitted.
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount -a [-t|-O]  ...     : mount all stuff from /etc/fstab
[06:22] <ray_> how do i run it once it's installed?
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount device             : mount device at the known place
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount directory          : mount known device here
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount -t type dev dir    : ordinary mount command
[06:22] <nathansnook> The Gnome X GUI interface
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> Note that one does not really mount a device, one mounts
[06:22] <Managu> !tell morbidhunger about paste
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> a filesystem (of the given type) found on the device.
[06:22] <Rug> !paste
[06:22] <ubotu> Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> One can also mount an already visible directory tree elsewhere:
[06:22] <linux_newbie2> Managu: Wrote partition table, but re-read table failed.  Reboot to update table.  Toggle bootable flag of the current partition.
[06:22] <NytShade> |Sivik|, easy way being?
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount --bind olddir newdir
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> or move a subtree:
[06:22] <MorbidHunger>        mount --move olddir newdir
[06:22] <nathansnook> Also firefox is a little slow.
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> A device can be given by name, say /dev/hda1 or /dev/cdrom,
[06:22] <|Sivik|> NytShade, kde or gnome?
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> or by label, using  -L label  or by uuid, using  -U uuid .
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> Other options: [-nfFrsvw]  [-o options]  [-p passwdfd] .
[06:22] <amphi> ray_: the manpage says "atitvout - ATI Rage/Radeon TV Out configuration program"
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> For many more details, say  man 8 mount
[06:22] <whereeee> Where can I download a spanish dictionary for openoffice????? Please!!!!!
[06:22] <Managu> linux_newbie: worth a shot
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> thats what it says
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> id burn it, but i have no cdrs
[06:22] <Rug> MorbidHunger: Stop flodding the channel!
[06:22] <Apostle^> i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> ok ok
[06:22] <NytShade> |Sivik|, um default...
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> someone asked a question
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> i answered
[06:22] <nathansnook> I have just had ubuntu 5.10 for about a day or two and my girlfriend says it slower than fedora core
[06:22] <cr1mson> Where can I get the original sources.list for Ubuntu Dapper Beta?  I seemed to have messed mine up.
[06:22] <linux_newbie2> Managu: well, I am on LiveCD, so just reboot?
[06:22] <Rug> !paste
[06:22] <ubotu> Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
[06:23] <ray_> manpage? sorry, i'm very new to this obviously
[06:23] <Managu> linux_newbie2: yup

[06:23] <linux_newbie2> ok
[06:23] <Managu> linux_newbie2: don't forget to remove the CD, or properly change your bios, etc
[06:23] <amphi> MorbidHunger: perhaps you didn't specify an existing directory as a mount point?
[06:23] <duco> Hoy how can i get skype downloaded even when i dont have  windos
[06:23] <|Sivik|> NytShade, if you go to places and then network servers, you should be able to see the mshome thingy
[06:23] <amphi> ray_: man atitvout (assuming you installed it)
[06:23] <KaosX> duco: there is a linux build of skype
=== Smokeh is now known as NoCrown
=== NoCrown is now known as Smokeh
[06:24] <|Sivik|> NytShade, you should be able to see it there
[06:24] <Managu> nathansnook: ahh.  A pissing contest then?  I'd definitely let my girlfriend win, no contest, if I were in that situation.
[06:24] <whereeee> ok thks!!!
[06:24] <Managu> nathansnook: ahh.  A pissing contest then?  I'd definitely let my girlfriend win, no contest, if I were in that situation.
[06:24] <NytShade> |Sivik|, a password diologue box has poped up.
[06:24] <|Sivik|> NytShade, ok
[06:24] <nathansnook> Is there a package like Rpm for ubuntu?
[06:24] <duco> yes idid download it
[06:24] <NytShade> |Sivik|, it's not accepting my user and password.
[06:24] <Managu> nathansnook: ubuntu uses the apt-get/dpkg (.deb) package management system
[06:24] <|Sivik|> NytShade, then go into windows and edit is so you don't have to ask for password when loging in to the windows box
[06:25] <tagabasak_> dli, i dont have /etc/fstab
[06:25] <KaosX> nathanshook: debs are the ones use in ubuntu...you can convert RPMS with the alien commnad
[06:25] <MorbidHunger> i tried to mount it to mt home folder
[06:25] <KaosX> most people use apt-get though
[06:25] <Rug> tagabasak_: yes you do, you MUST have it
[06:25] <|Sivik|> NytShade, i'm not sure how to fix that, never had the problem with user and password for samba
[06:25] <tagabasak_> rug, sorry got it now
[06:25] <NytShade> I'm not logging into the wondows box.
[06:25] <Apostle^> i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
[06:25] <|Sivik|> NytShade, what do you mean your not loggint to the windows box
[06:25] <KaosX> NytShade: you have to add the user to samba
[06:25] <nathansnook> Firefox 1.5 is that supported with apt get or not quite yet?
[06:26] <NytShade> |Sivik|, all I did was open the Network Servers "place"
[06:26] <Managu> nathansnook: not quite yet
[06:26] <GTroy> nathahsnook, I don't belive you can apt get it yet
[06:26] <GTroy> !firefox1.5
[06:26] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[06:26] <tagabasak_> dli, how can i correct my /etc/fstab?
[06:26] <|Sivik|> NytShade, then thats same password as your sudo su password
[06:26] <|Sivik|> NytShade, is that the window that pops up?
[06:26] <NytShade> |Sivik|, I've entered my username and sudo pass. It's not accepting.
[06:27] <|Sivik|> NytShade, or does that happen when you click on the Windows Network icon?
[06:27] <Apostle^> i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
[06:27] <MorbidHunger> enter your pass the sudo password
[06:27] <|Sivik|> Apostle^, mount it as root
[06:27] <Apostle^> |Sivik|, k
[06:27] <NytShade> |Sivik|, It happened as soon as I opend the "Network Servers" place.
[06:27] <tagabasak_> ls
[06:27] <Apostle^> |Sivik|, but it's mounted automatically
[06:28] <|Sivik|> Apostle^, uh, you can unmount it in terminal and then remount it
[06:28] <|Sivik|> Apostle^, its just permission issues
[06:28] <duco> Hoy how can i get skype downloaded even when i dont have  windos  but ihave linux and java  but iget skype but ikant get it working
[06:28] <Apostle^> |Sivik|, when i try to remount it it says no entry in fstab, because i don't have one
[06:28] <clever> how do i get a dialup modem to work on ubuntu?
[06:28] <Managu> duco: is English your first language?
[06:28] <GTroy> duco, sudo apt-get install skype
[06:28] <amphi> clever: a real one/
[06:28] <|Sivik|> Apostle^, the device should be /dev/sda1 unless you have a sata hd
[06:28] <amphi> ?
[06:29] <KaosX> duco: what cant you get working
[06:29] <HymnToLife> duco> you can download a DEB from Skype's website
[06:29] <Apostle^> |Sivik|, it's /dev/sda2
[06:29] <|Sivik|> Apostle^, ok, then all you should have to do is "mount /dev/sda2 /place/youwantitmounted
[06:30] <Apostle^> |Sivik|, then i have to use sudo to do anything
[06:30] <linux_newbie2> Managu: it worked! Thank you thank you thank you!
[06:30] <nightshade> what up ppl
=== rey is now known as roscslab
[06:30] <KaosX> you should just need sudo to mount it for write acess

[06:30] <ray_> amphi, here's what the atitvout is telling me
[06:30] <ray_> sudo atitvout tvout

[06:32] <HymnToLife> GTroy> never tried Linux on them but I heard there are lots of problems

[06:33] <HymnToLife> clever_ > clever people don't use Ubuntu
[06:33] <clever_> didnt even ask which partitions to use so if i hadnt allready backed my stuff up it would have probly whiped my old os's
[06:33] <GTroy> ray_ you have to find the way to open bios when you start
[06:33] <HymnToLife> go for Slackware :p
[06:33] <clever_> i was using redhat9
[06:33] <GTroy> HymnToLIfe, why slack?
[06:33] <clever_> wanted to have a look at ubuntu

[06:34] <GTroy> hymntolife, good answer
[06:35] <clever_> ubuntu i find is good for windows based users but its tricky for programing

[06:37] <omg> 2 hours for dowload it
[06:37] <omg> and now 2 more for installing it
[06:37] <omg> lol
[06:37] <omg> is a stupid dictionary
[06:37] <KaosX> rob138: you sure your monitor doesnt have that function in it?
[06:37] <GTroy> rob138, I would take the advice with xrandr
[06:37] <clever_> yeah i dont know how to do that on linux rob138
[06:37] <KaosX> somewhere inside it;s menu
[06:38] <omg> why is so impossible
[06:38] <amphi> rob138: try xrandr
[06:38] <omg> for open office
[06:38] <clever_> [21 23:11:01]  -> *#hollownes* 643/653 Chem - I got five on it (#15786) (UAFFA) -> Soul reaper3 (#2538) (xHDSx) and won 4Civs/412Acres
[06:38] <clever_> -
[06:38] <clever_> crap
[06:38] <clever_> wrong paste
[06:38] <clever_> 0000:00:10.1 Communication controller: 3Com Corporation Mini PCI 56k Winmodem (rev 10)
[06:38] <GTroy> rob138, I think amphi is right
[06:38] <clever_> thats the winmodem i cant get working
[06:38] <amphi> clever_: have a look on linmodems.org
[06:38] <rob138> alright
[06:38] <omg> how do you add a dictionary to openoffice
[06:38] <KaosX> bleh...winmodems
[06:38] <rob138> amphi, thanks
[06:38] <omg> i'm getting really annoyed
[06:38] <Rug> rob138: I would edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf to reflect your desired resolution.
[06:38] <clever_> amphi: i also have a external serial modem
[06:38] <KaosX> i dont even like them in windows
[06:38] <clever_> which i cant detect
[06:38] <HymnToLife> clever_ > on www.linmodems.org you'll find help to deal with it
[06:39] <amphi> clever_: that'd be trivial to setup
[06:39] <rob138> Rug, but the thing is i need the environment to be drawn sideways so to speak
[06:39] <clever_> the external modem isnt being auto detected by the network admin prog
[06:39] <KaosX> rob138: display options under preferences doesnt give that option?
[06:39] <Rug> rob138: so you want to be able to "flip" the screen?
[06:39] <amphi> clever_: just tell whatever you use to dial to use /dev/ttySwhatever
[06:39] <dli> clever_,  can you try wvdial
[06:40] <rob138> Rug, yes, KaosX, nope
[06:40] <clever_> i dont know which ttssX to use
[06:40] <clever_> and i didnt try wvdial yet
[06:40] <amphi> rob138: xrandr can rotate the display
[06:40] <HymnToLife> clever_> wvdialconf might tell you
[06:40] <clever_> allready spent 20 hours trying to get that to work on the winmodem before i knew it was a winmodem
[06:40] <dli> clever, try it, " wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf "
[06:40] <dli> clever, try it, " sudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf "
[06:40] <rob138> amphi, do i need a lot of arguments ? or is there like -r for rotate
[06:40] <HymnToLife> with sudo
[06:40] <clever_> scaning
[06:40] <clever_> allready did sudo su -
[06:40] <KaosX> clever_: i feel that way with linux and my ibook (airport extreme)
[06:40] <amphi> clever_: or use minicom, and throw atz at dev/ttyS[1..n]  until you get 'ok'
[06:41] <clever_> gives me a root term without setting a pass
[06:41] <amphi> rob138: man xrandr has the details
[06:41] <clever_> the modem lights flashed
[06:41] <rob138> alright
[06:41] <clever_> looks like it worked:)
[06:41] <hawkeey> where can I find information about ubuntu packages?
[06:41] <HymnToLife> clever_ > use sudo -i instead, sudo su can wreck up your permissions
[06:41] <KaosX> know what else about a sudo su - term....theres no .bash_history saved either
[06:41] <hawkeey> I am interested in ipw3945
[06:41] <Rug> hawkeey: what did you want to know?
[06:41] <Rug> ahh
[06:41] <clever_> how can it wreck the perms HymnToLife ?
[06:42] <clever_> end up making files owned by what you where before the sudo?
[06:42] <amphi> hawkeey: ipw3945.sf.net I believe - have fun with the 'regulatory daemon' ;)
[06:42] <HymnToLife> clever_ > I trust the folks who told me so and are far more knowledgeable than me
[06:42] <clever_> ahh
[06:42] <rob138> amphi, the only options it allows for are under (342mmx271mm) not the other way around
[06:42] <clever_> i find it doesnt set $home right
[06:42] <clever_> so i end up in my old home dir and other random things
[06:43] <rob138> amphi, and the only rotations possible are "normal"
[06:43] <KaosX> some people say its because youre using your password to launch a root shell...somethings dont auth correctly...sometimes end up with no owner
[06:43] <clever_> wvdialconf is allready setup with my name/pass/# /me makes shure it isnt word readable:S
[06:43] <JohnDanger> what should my fstab entry look like so an ipod can be written, umask= ?
[06:43] <rob138> amphi, i can try to figure it out, i'm sure you're not the expert on the program
[06:43] <clever_> crap it is:P
[06:43] <Sivik-homework> how do i get a ubuntu box to ack as a ftp server
[06:43] <Sivik-homework> !ftpserver
[06:43] <ubotu> I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Sivik-homework
[06:43] <Sivik-homework> !ftp
[06:43] <ubotu> FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: vsftpd, proftpd
[06:43] <Sivik-homework> nvm
[06:44] <hawkeey> Rug: I wanted to know how the package worked and if it is available for install
[06:44] <rob138> how do i configure my monitor?
[06:44] <JohnDanger> what should my fstab entry look like so an ipod can be written, umask= ?
[06:44] <PyroMithrandir> I use proftpd, but I don't really like it ;)
[06:44] <hawkeey> amphi: umm... so is it in dapper drake or not?
[06:44] <amphi> rob138: you're SOL if only normal is allowed, AFAIK
[06:44] <HymnToLife> I use VSFTPd and it rocks
[06:44] <amphi> hawkeey: no idea - ask in #ubuntu+1 perhaps
[06:44] <KaosX> ive used vsftpd for a while
[06:44] <KaosX> thats what we used in school too
[06:44] <rob138> amphi, is that monitor side or graphics card side?
[06:45] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> 002
[06:45] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, thanks
[06:45] <amphi> rob138: not sure, the card I would have thought (or rather the driver)
[06:46] <Rug> poll time:  what do you prefer to use  Katapult or a "Run Command Line" to launch programs in your GUI
[06:46] <rob138> amphi, guessing so cuz i have ati
=== Klowner_ is now known as Klowner
[06:46] <amphi> Rug: I have a keybinding to launch grun
[06:46] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i still cant write to it man..
[06:46] <clever_> Rug: i perfer a gnome-terminal open 24/7 and use bash's & to bg stuff
[06:46] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, ok, when i run vsftpd, how do i set up a user?
[06:46] <Rug> all very nice answers...
[06:47] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> please pastebin your fstab
[06:47] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i think it's because /media/ipod belongs to root.. but i can't chown it
[06:47] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, how do i set up a user for vsftpd?
[06:47] <Flannel> rob138: what card do you have?
[06:47] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> just add a user to your system
[06:47] <clever_> Rug: using a term window lets me use tab completion and lets me watch the output of them without needed extra term windows for each
[06:47] <HymnToLife> FTP is just another way to login
[06:47] <rob138> flannel Radeon X800XT
[06:48] <Flannel> rob138: ATI? or NV? or somethign eles?
[06:48] <rob138> flannel ATI
[06:48] <Taru> How do I find out the root password?
[06:48] <HymnToLife> !tell Taru about rot
[06:48] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, its already in the system
[06:48] <HymnToLife> !tell Taru about root
[06:48] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, its the current user i'm loged in with
[06:48] <Rug> clever_: you might want to consider switching to aterm, it'll cut down on memory usage.
[06:48] <Samuli^> Taru, you don't have one as a default
[06:48] <Taru> I am trying to install the Linux (self-extracting) file
[06:49] <Sivik-homework> when i connect via gftp, it says only anoymous is allowed to connect
[06:49] <clever_> i keep a single multi tabed gnome-terminal window open
[06:49] <Taru> I typed "Su".
[06:49] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> you need to allow_local_users, check man vsftpd.conf
[06:49] <Taru> It's asking for root password.
[06:49] <clever_> and often a xterm for stuff that needs a fast term
[06:49] <Sivik-homework> ok
[06:49] <Samuli^> Taru, it's the password of first user.
[06:49] <Taru> Samuli^, o.O
[06:49] <ZeZu> what is the applications name that comes with nv-glx, it generates its own xorg.conf file ?
[06:49] <JohnDanger> !paste
[06:49] <ubotu> Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
[06:49] <Sivik-homework> where is the vsftp.conf?
[06:49] <clever_> locate vsftp.conf
[06:49] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> in /etc just like every other config file
[06:50] <clever_> probly at /etc/vsftp.conf
[06:50] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, ok
[06:50] <GTroy> guess that was to hymntolife danger
[06:50] <Taru> Samuli^, I am first user, aren't I?
[06:50] <Flannel> rob138: hmm, its rather easy in nvidia, I dont see anything about ATI though.
[06:50] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14435
[06:50] <Samuli^> Taru, probably.
[06:50] <hawkeey> is there some place where I can search for ubuntu packages?
[06:50] <Taru> Samuli^, I typed my own password that didn't work hmm.
[06:50] <disinterseted_pe> how do i enter a yahoo chat room through gaim
[06:50] <Sivik-homework> apt-cache search "packagename"
[06:50] <rob138> flannel, where are you looking?
[06:50] <Sivik-homework> without the ""
[06:50] <Samuli^> Taru, Hmm, I don't know. Use sudo instead of su?
[06:50] <hawkeey> I don't have ubuntu installed
[06:50] <Taru> Samuli^, Ok, thanks^^
[06:50] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> try adding rw, to your mount parameters
[06:50] <clever_> that works Samuli^
[06:51] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, where
[06:51] <ZeZu> anyone?
[06:51] <hawkeey> I am trying to see where a particular package is located before I do an install
[06:51] <hawkeey> is there a website like packages.debian.org
[06:51] <ZeZu> installing nvidia-glx doesn't change the driver itself, i know where to change that but i want to setup dual head and such
[06:51] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> wherever you want, at the beginning for ex, so it would lok loke rw,sync,user,noauto,umask=002
[06:51] <ZeZu> the main installer on the nv site doesn't see my linux source files for some reason
[06:52] <ZeZu> so it can't build it
[06:52] <disinterseted_pe> does anyone use yahoo in gaim?
[06:52] <Taru> Samuli^, Sudo brings me to some wierd command.
[06:52] <clever_> i use yahoo in gaim but not for chat rooms
[06:52] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i think the problem is the owner is 'steven' but i'm 'pete'
[06:52] <Samuli^> Taru, what do you mean?
[06:52] <clever_> Taru: sudo -i
[06:52] <Rug> irssi for IRC
[06:52] <babo> I'm downloading clip art from the M$ office website, but instead of the art being saved on my computer. I get .mpf xml files instead ? ... what's going on ?
[06:52] <clever_> to get a term window
[06:52] <pycs> <disinterseted_pe> in the tools menu there is room list
[06:52] <clever_> as root
[06:52] <Taru> Samuli^, I am trying to install Java (current version), so that I can run Frostwire smoothly.
[06:53] <Flannel> rob138: well, NV can do it with the video card, to get it to work with ATI (or anything else) you might need to use RANDR (Resize and Rotate, basically a screen utility) to get it to work.
[06:53] <disinterseted_pe> johndanger do u have any idea how u get into room in yahoo through gaim?
[06:53] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> then set uid=your_uid
[06:53] <Taru> Samuli^, I have Frostwire installed, but needs working Java.
[06:53] <HymnToLife> same for gid=your_gid
[06:53] <disinterseted_pe> ok ty pycs
[06:53] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, HymnToLife can you show me an example
[06:53] <Flannel> Taru: why not just get it from the repository?
[06:53] <JohnDanger> disinterseted_pe, no i don't
[06:53] <Taru> Samuli^, I installed the default Java, but that seems not good enough.
[06:53] <Samuli^> Taru, o-kay. So you have a deb-package for java? "Sudo dpkg -i package.deb"
[06:53] <Taru> Flannel, How?
[06:53] <vars> hey i got a error and ubuntu wouldn't install grub but it lilo worked.   lilo sucks how can i install grub?
[06:53] <Taru> Flannel, I just started using Ubuntu today, I am a very much new.
[06:53] <rob138> flannel, randr only gives options for different resolutions, and even when i changed them in randr, none of my windows adapt, just the veiw i have
[06:53] <GTroy> taru, open synaptic package manager
[06:54] <Samuli^> Flannel, I don't think sun's java is available for breezy.
[06:54] <rob138> flannel, kinda like zooming
[06:54] <Taru> Samuli^, I did, but getting it again.
[06:54] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, i changed the vstfpd.conf but it still says that anoyomous is the only way to login
[06:54] <GTroy> Flannel, I'll help taru
[06:54] <Taru> GTroy, Ok.
[06:54] <Flannel> Samuli^: yeah it is.  It's in the repositories ;)
[06:54] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> the option is in there, check the manpage
[06:54] <Samuli^> Flannel, Okay. Cool. I thought it was just for Dapper.
[06:54] <vars> please help me
[06:54] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14436
[06:54] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, thanks
[06:54] <Flannel> Samuli^: nah, it's been retroactively put into Breezy.  I was unsure for a while too.
[06:55] <Samuli^> Taru, so type sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre then.
[06:55] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.og/14437
[06:55] <Flannel> rob138: RANDR should work for an entire X, I dont know what sorts of config you'll need though
[06:55] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, thats what my vsftpd.conf file looks like
[06:55] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> wanna have a look at mine ?
[06:55] <Samuli^> taru, you need to have multiverse or universe in the repos though.
[06:55] <Taru> Says "You must run this program as root user"
[06:56] <rob138> flannel, eh, too complicated and difficult for something hardly neccessary, thanks
[06:56] <Taru> Samuli^, Ok
[06:56] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, i changed the anonymoung_enable=NO and i changed my local_enable=YES
[06:56] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, sure
[06:56] <GTroy> taru, don't type synaptic in terminal
[06:56] <Flannel> Samuli^: sun-j2sdk1.5 for breezy
[06:56] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, so mine is 1002 i think?
[06:56] <Samuli^> Taru, what Flannel just said.
[06:56] <GTroy> open it from system-->administration-->synaptic
[06:57] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, please let me see your vsftpd.conf file
[06:57] <disinterseted_pe> pycs i get the same thing trying to join any rooms in yahoo maybe the room is full is there not any way to get in them any settings?
[06:57] <Taru> How do i go about with multiverse or universe in repos?
[06:57] <HymnToLife> Sivik-homework> http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/vsftpd.conf
[06:57] <GTroy> taru, I'll show you
[06:57] <Taru> GTroy, Ok!
[06:57] <Sivik-homework> GTroy, or the person can do sudo synaptic to get it in root moe
[06:57] <GTroy> have you got synaptic open
[06:58] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i still can't write to the ipod' still says owner 'steven'
[06:58] <Taru> Where is it?
[06:58] <GTroy> sivik-homework, true but it's easier to start with gui operations
[06:58] <Samuli^> Flannel, though.. isn't sdk the developer version and jre just runtime-enviroment?
[06:58] <amphi> rob138: any success?
[06:58] <Samuli^> Flannel, sdk is going to get you packages you don't actually need if you're not coding in java.
[06:58] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> are you sure you set the right uid and then remount the device ?
[06:58] <GTroy> taru, look up to my post
[06:58] <rob138> amphi, nope, i don't think it's possible with my graphics card driver for ATI
[06:58] <Flannel> Samuli^: right, but that's all you get.  sdk includes the jre.
[06:59] <pycs> disinterseted_pe, i get the same thing too in gyach enhanced, but maybe the room is full for now, you can log in later :)
[06:59] <Samuli^> Flannel, true. I don't know if the size difference is much.
[06:59] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, yea, my UID is 1002 same with gid i got them from users & groups ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14438
[06:59] <Taru> GTroy, cool, thanks^^
[06:59] <Flannel> Samuli^: they just lumped the entire java thing into the package for breezy.  piecewise is dapper only.
[06:59] <vars> is there a way to install the 2.4 kernal
[06:59] <Flannel> vars: sure, use apt.
[06:59] <disinterseted_pe> ok i didnt think there was anything that could be done ty pycs
[07:00] <vars> ok
[07:00] <Sivik-homework> HymnToLife, now its telling me that the ip connection refused
[07:00] <GTroy> flannel: hahha easy anser
[07:00] <rob138> amphi, xranr info: Rotations possible - normal
[07:00] <amphi> rob138: yeah, I've been futzing with it, no success yet
[07:01] <CaptainMorgan> omg.. amarok is so buggy..
[07:01] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> did you remount your device ?
[07:01] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, yes
[07:01] <GTroy> captainmorgan, the new version?
[07:01] <GTroy> hey lilo
[07:01] <CaptainMorgan> !amarok
[07:01] <ubotu> [amarok]  a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
[07:02] <CaptainMorgan> shoot... I gotta get 1.4
[07:02] <Flannel> rob138: actually, I think it's completely impossible.  actually.
[07:02] <CaptainMorgan> I still have 1.3.7
[07:02] <GTroy> capt, there you go
[07:02] <CaptainMorgan> how do I update it?
[07:02] <rob138> flannel, really?
[07:03] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, you probably need to compile it from the source.
[07:03] <Flannel> rob138: maybe for breezy, but as of 10-10 last year, the proprietary ATI driver didnt support rotation.
[07:03] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i can't figure this out
[07:03] <B1zz> CaptainMorgan yeah 1.4 is nice :) but still has some bugs...
[07:03] <HymnToLife> CaptainMorgan> amarok 1.6 packages are on separate repos, see kubuntu.org
[07:03] <GTroy> captainmorgan, use synaptic to remove amarok, than compile the new one
[07:03] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i tried with user 'steven' but it still says readd only file system
[07:03] <Flannel> rob138: erm, maybe in dapper you'll be able to.  might have a newer fgrlx (or whatever it) is driver
[07:03] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, though check first if there's ubuntu-deb package, or even better repository available.
[07:03] <B1zz> there is a v1.6?

[07:13] (CaptainMorgan/#ubuntu) folks, how do I kill this process?
[07:13] (disinterseted_pe/#ubuntu) vars do u know which codecs?
[07:13] (rob138/#ubuntu) flannel, thanks, whenever i try to rotate i get an error, so it must be my driver
[07:13] (Taru/#ubuntu) GTroy, Add then ?
[07:13] (CaptainMorgan/#ubuntu) amarok keeps playing - and its removed using syn

[07:15] <GTroy> taru, or at least your repos
[07:15] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, now it says 500 OOPS: could not open chroot() list file:/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
[07:15] <CaptainMorgan> holy crap Flannel - that's a lot of processes...

[07:15] <CaptainMorgan> I think that did it tho..
[07:15] <CaptainMorgan> it was there
[07:15] <Taru> ok Downloading the package information
[07:15] <Rug> IMPOSSIBLE: you should talk.  I am tired of punks comming in here and DEMANDING answers.  Who have you helped in here today?
[07:15] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, do i just need to comment that out again
[07:15] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> write to it as root :D
[07:15] <Flannel> CaptainMorgan: heh, try ps aux | grep [whatever] 
[07:15] <Taru> GTroy, Ok, it finished.
[07:15] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, ndoesn't work
[07:15] <vars> disinterseted_pe, w23codecs
[07:15] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, tells me read-only file system

[07:15] <CaptainMorgan> still do that command?
[07:15] <Flannel> IMPOSSIBLE: "the spanish one"? for which program, etc?
[07:15] <harisund> HymnToLife I just used the /opt/firefox/icons/mozicon128.png and it works. Thanks !
[07:15] <GTroy> taru, when you want to install a program use search in synaptic!!!
[07:16] <disinterseted_pe> i installed that and nothing worked
[07:16] <JohnDanger> root@Penguin:/media/ipod# mkdir 1
[07:16] <JohnDanger> mkdir: cannot create directory `1': Read-only file system
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> ufff i dont remember... i request help to download it
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> they help me fast
[07:16] <vars> hmm
[07:16] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> just restart the server
[07:16] <Taru> GTroy, Ok, thanks so much^^
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> and then i leaved the chat
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> the 2 hhours was doing by myself
[07:16] <CaptainMorgan> oh damn.. Flannel that lists two processes..
[07:16] <Rug> IMPOSSIBLE: that is my point.
[07:16] <GTroy> taru, yep!!
[07:16] <vars> go to a console and do mplayer your.wma
[07:16] <Flannel> CaptainMorgan: well, that's better than 800000 now isn't it ;)
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> flannel i've downloaded es_ES.zip
[07:16] <CaptainMorgan> Flannel those two are not listed in the original sudo ps aux
[07:16] <IMPOSSIBLE> for open office
[07:16] <CaptainMorgan> right?
[07:16] <CaptainMorgan> hah
[07:16] <disinterseted_pe> i installed that from the synaptic set up
[07:16] <Flannel> CaptainMorgan: well, one is the grep itself,
[07:17] <CaptainMorgan> right..
[07:17] <CaptainMorgan> figured that out..
[07:17] <CaptainMorgan> thanks
[07:17] <CaptainMorgan> driving me bonkers
[07:17] <Taru> GTroy, So Java should be in there now?
[07:17] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, dmesg shows this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14439
[07:17] <IMPOSSIBLE> home/feryana/.openoffice.org2/user/wordbook
[07:17] <GTroy> taru, java is a little different
[07:17] <disinterseted_pe> vars i dont know where console is
[07:17] <Flannel> IMPOSSIBLE: why dont you get it from apt?
[07:17] <rob138> why would someone use Vmware to run linux on linux?
[07:17] <IMPOSSIBLE> i've put the two files there
[07:17] <Taru> GTroy, Or check everything here and update?
[07:17] <IMPOSSIBLE> apt?
[07:18] <Flannel> IMPOSSIBLE: synaptic?
[07:18] <GTroy> taru, sure
[07:18] <Taru> GTroy, ok
[07:18] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> try reformatting your ipod
[07:18] <HymnToLife> from Windows
[07:18] <IMPOSSIBLE> i tried that at the beggening
[07:18] <amphi> rob138: couldn't get it to work here :(
[07:18] <vars> disinterseted_pe, go to the applications an look for terminal
[07:18] <Rug> rob138: to test a different distro (without screwing up existing partitions)
[07:18] <IMPOSSIBLE> i've downloaded the tar.gz
[07:18] <Ademan> HEY, does anyone know why ubuntu is interpreting the "mousewheel left" input as a left click? (like i have a 4 way mousewheel, and when i move it left, it gets counted as a mouseclick)
[07:18] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, i don't have windows..
[07:18] <GTroy> taru, only the programs you want on your system
[07:18] <IMPOSSIBLE> but i dont know how to run it
[07:18] <disinterseted_pe> ok then what?
[07:18] <Flannel> IMPOSSIBLE: right, tar.gz isn't ubuntu's packages.
[07:18] <HymnToLife> JohnDanger> you most likely have some friens
[07:18] <rob138> amphi, i don't know who or where to suggest it to
[07:18] <HymnToLife> and most likely some of them use Windows
[07:18] <rob138> rug, ah
[07:18] <IMPOSSIBLE> then what I must download
[07:18] <Taru> GTroy, ok
[07:18] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, nothing else i can do?
[07:18] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, will a PC reboot help
[07:19] <amphi> rob138: xrandr is meant to do it, but not on my card it seems
[07:19] <HymnToLife> I doubt it
[07:19] <Flannel> IMPOSSIBLE: start up synaptic and search for spanish and office, or whatever you think might work
[07:19] <rob138> amphi, nor mine :)
[07:19] <HymnToLife> it seems yoout FAT filesystem is somehow corrupted
[07:19] <IMPOSSIBLE> ok and sorry my noobie act, but, how I do that :P
[07:19] <rob138> so if i wanted to run windows inside linux, i need A. windows installer cd B. vmware player... anything else?
[07:19] <GTroy> taru, java won't be installed in your browser though
[07:19] <amphi> rob138: I think I wasted some time trying this before... ;)
[07:19] <JohnDanger> HymnToLife, what the hell now it works suddenly
[07:19] <Taru> GTroy, Yes, I am mainly looking to install this Java program, since I want frostwire to work.
[07:19] <vars> i have a server install of ubuntu can someone tell me what the univers repo looks like for hoary
[07:19] <HymnToLife> lmao
[07:19] <Flannel> Ademan: try checking this page : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ManyButtonsMouseHowto
[07:19] <Taru> GTroy, Yeah, I see.
[07:20] <test> mount
[07:20] <Ademan> thanks Flannel
[07:20] <GTroy> well frostwire will work (I think) if you install java through synaptic
[07:20] <Taru> GTroy, I tried Samuli^'s "sudo atp-get install sun-java5-jre"
[07:20] <Rug> test: need help?
[07:20] <Taru> GTroy, No work.
[07:21] <GTroy> try it now
[07:21] <test> Rug, yup please.. i cant repair my grub
[07:21] <IMPOSSIBLE> ok flannel I get it :P is on System
[07:21] <Samuli^> Taru, it's not by that name in Breezy.
[07:21] <IMPOSSIBLE> thanks buddie
[07:21] <Flannel> vars: server vs non server makes no difference for repos.   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesCliHowto will get you a general idea, the urls themselves should be the same, just the keywords
[07:21] <GTroy> taru, you might have need to set your repositories
[07:21] <Taru> Samuli^, Oh?
[07:21] <IMPOSSIBLE> I hope to install the s....d dictionary and not need to come more here and waste your time :P
[07:21] <Samuli^> Taru, Flannel remembered the name for suns java for breezy.
[07:21] <Flannel> vars: and, whereever that says breezy, you obviously want hoary
[07:22] <vars> i just need to know what to type to install the 2.4 kernal
[07:22] <GTroy> !java
[07:22] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[07:22] <vars> kernel
[07:22] <Taru> it gives me "E: unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another protocol using it?"
[07:22] <Samuli^> GTroy, that's old news.
[07:22] <Rug> Sorry I don't know much about grub repair, ask your specific question and hopefully someone in the channel can help you
[07:22] <test> Rug, when i boot onto my ubuntu it stops loading and have these msg..Alert /dev/hdc2 does not exist. Droping to a shell.
[07:22] <Samuli^> Sun's java is in the repositories now.
[07:22] <Taru> Samuli^, Oh ok ^^
[07:22] <IMPOSSIBLE> see ya pals
[07:22] <GTroy> samuli^ what's the right java for frostwire that taru needs?
[07:23] <Flannel> sun java should be fine.
[07:23] <Rug> test: if you boot with a Knoppix CD, can you access hdc2 ?
[07:23] <Taru> ok
[07:23] <HellDragon> hi, when i try to compile amule i get this
[07:23] <HellDragon> checking for C++ compiler default output file name... configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
[07:23] <Samuli^> Flannel, tell taru the package name for breezy.
[07:23] <HellDragon> what is the problem ?
[07:24] <test> Rug, i dont know what is hdc2 either. currently im booting know on ubuntu live cd...
[07:24] <Flannel> !javadebs
[07:24] <Rug> HellDragon: Did you install build-essential ?
[07:24] <HellDragon> hm let me look
[07:24] <x-Dieu> howdy world! :)
[07:24] <Flannel> eh, alright.  um, sun-j2sdk1.5 Taru.
[07:24] <Rug> test: ok good.   Can you goto /media/hdc2 ?
[07:24] <Taru> Flannel, Thank you ^^
[07:24] <HellDragon> no , im dling it ty
[07:25] <vars> there is kernal source and kernal tree  what do i do/
[07:25] <GTroy> taru type in termina after you close synaptic 'sudo apt-get install sun-j2sdk1.5'
[07:25] <rob138> so if i wanted to run windows inside linux, i need A. windows installer cd B. vmware player... anything else?
[07:25] <GTroy> taru, make sure synaptic is closed
[07:25] <amphi> vars: 'kernel' ;)
[07:25] <test> Rug, theres no /media/hdc2 only /media/hda2 for my linux partitions
[07:25] <HellDragon> yay it works
[07:25] <Taru> No wonder, its open hah ;;
[07:25] <|Sivik|> will mplayer view .wmv files?
[07:25] <Taru> Thank you so much guys ^^
[07:25] <vars> amphi, ok kernel
[07:25] <test> Rug, my linux partitions is  on /media/hda2
[07:25] <vars> but which one
[07:25] <GTroy> taru, tell us if it works
[07:25] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> maybe, with w32codecs
[07:26] <HymnToLife> not all of them are playable though
[07:26] <vars> |Sivik|, yes
[07:26] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, so i need to install the w32codecs?
[07:26] <Taru> "E: couldn't find package"
[07:26] <Taru> hmm lol
[07:26] <HymnToLife> yes
[07:26] <HellDragon> checking for wx-config... no
[07:26] <HellDragon> checking that wxWidgets has support for large files... no
[07:26] <HellDragon> now i get errors with that
[07:26] <Samuli^> Taru, you have the repositories enabled do you?
[07:26] <Taru> wait im in root
[07:26] <Taru> exit
[07:26] <Taru> miss
[07:26] <Rug> test: in a term window type the following:   sudo mkdir /media/hdc2    then:  sudo mount /dev/hdc2 /media/hdc2
[07:27] <Taru> Samuli^, I think so.
[07:27] <|Sivik|> HymnToLife, i'm using your sources.list stuff so it can find that w32codecs, if i hadn't used the stuff you had, i wouldn't have been able to get it
[07:27] <Samuli^> Taru, better to make sure. Paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to pastebin
[07:27] <HellDragon> ::(
[07:27] <HymnToLife> |Sivik|> !w32codecs would have told you :)
[07:27] <Samuli^> Taru, cat /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:28] <Taru> Samuli^, ok
[07:28] <HellDragon> i cant find wx-config in synaptic
[07:28] <CaptainMorgan> !amarok
[07:28] <HellDragon> thats weird
[07:28] <ZeZu> is there somekind of trick to get nv-glx working in dapper?
[07:28] <para_site> what does apt-get --build source do ?
[07:28] <HymnToLife> para_site> man apt-get
[07:28] <Rug> ZeZu: nah it's kind of easy
[07:28] <CaptainMorgan> !amarok
[07:28] <Taru> Samuli^, Ok i see comments and deb-src and deb http://.
[07:28] <Samuli^> para_site, it builds .deb packages out of the source.
[07:28] <ubotu> methinks amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/ - To install Amarok 1.4 on Ubuntu, see http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php
[07:28] <ZeZu> Rug, not working though
[07:29] <Samuli^> Taru, copy & paste all that to pastebin
[07:29] <ZeZu> it wont even let me install nvidia-glx and nvidia-settings at the same time
[07:29] <Taru> Samuli^, ok
[07:29] <Samuli^> !tell Taru about pastebin
[07:29] <para_site> Samuli^ , what do I do with the .deb packages , I mean how do I install them ?
[07:29] <Rug> ZeZu: make sure you have nvidia-glx, retricted-modules installed
[07:29] <Samuli^> para_site, dpkg -i package.deb
[07:29] <ZeZu> Rug, i have both
[07:29] <CaptainMorgan> how can I use 1.4 amarok? it appears to only be compatible with kubuntu
[07:29] <disinterseted_pe> sudo aptitude install vlc totem-xine xine-ui i just used this command and it installed buti still done get any streamlink it said url was not found on this server
[07:29] <para_site> there is some .dsc file also that is created
[07:29] <Samuli^> para_site, easier to just use the binaries though.
[07:29] <Taru> how do i access pastebin?
[07:30] <CaptainMorgan> Taru, pastebin.com
[07:30] <Madpilot> CaptainMorgan, you can run KDE apps in Gnome, and vice versa
[07:30] <rob138> is there a way to view the goods of an enhanced CD?
[07:30] <Taru> CaptainMorgan, ok thanks^^
[07:30] <para_site> Samuli ^ , thanks
[07:30] <IMPOSSIBLE> well well well
[07:30] <B1zz> and in XFCE like i am :-p
[07:30] <IMPOSSIBLE> installed :D
[07:30] <rredd4> can ubuntu work with my wireless pcmcia card? easy or hard to config (I did it for debian, used ndiswrapper)
[07:30] <IMPOSSIBLE> with synaptics
[07:31] <IMPOSSIBLE> 2 and half hour for it hahahaa
[07:31] <Flannel> rredd4: if you did it in debian, you can do it in ubuntu.  Once dapper comes out, it's got a full blown GUI fr it.
[07:31] <Taru> Still loading pastebin on web, hnn.
[07:31] <Flannel> !paste
[07:31] <ubotu> Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
[07:31] <Taru> Nevermind.
[07:31] <rredd4> Flannel  when is dapper due?
[07:31] <Madpilot> rredd4, June 1st
[07:31] <IMPOSSIBLE> Flannel thks :))
[07:31] <Madpilot> !dapper
[07:31] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[07:31] <B1zz> you can also install Knetwork manager to manae your wirelss networks
[07:32] <rob138> but not until then
[07:32] <Rug> ZeZu: if you follow the directions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074   it should work fine.
[07:32] <Taru> So paste and send?
[07:33] <CaptainMorgan> what am I missing? I got OK from doing this: http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php

[07:33] <Samuli^> Taru, Yeah.
[07:33] <Samuli^> Taru, and then tell us the url.

[07:34] <ZeZu> Rug
[07:34] <Samuli^> johnstar, You don't buy them. That's the whole point of ubuntu
[07:34] <FliesLikeABrick> johnstar they're free on www.ubuntu.com

[07:34] <ZeZu> The following NEW packages will be installed
[07:34] <ZeZu>   nvidia-settings
[07:34] <Rug> johnstar: you can order them for free
[07:34] <johnstar> I know the free cds
[07:34] <ZeZu> tell me why that doesn't make sense
[07:34] <ZeZu> you need both but one removes the other ?
[07:34] <johnstar> I like the dvd with live on it too
[07:34] <vars> i think johnstar gets it
[07:35] <Samuli^> johnstar, you order them for free (and without postal-fees)
[07:35] <johnstar> + dvd has faster install time
[07:35] <test> HELP!
[07:35] <Rug> ZeZu: what kernel version are you using?

[07:36] <CaptainMorgan> and syn still says 1.3.7
[07:36] <HellDragon> how can i recompile wxwidgets with "Support for large files in wxWidgets is required by aMule.
[07:36] <HellDragon>                 To continue you must recompile wxWidgets with support for
[07:36] <HellDragon>                 large files enabled.
[07:36] <HellDragon> "
[07:36] <HellDragon> ?
[07:36] <johnstar> I work in a computer store I want to see if I can get 100+ and sell them for like a buck or so
[07:36] <bimberi> rob138: install build-essential, it brings in those and other stuff useful for compiling
[07:36] <test> anyone can help me here abput restoring grub?
[07:37] <amphi> rob138: build-essential will install them
[07:37] <dv_> HellDragon, thats bad. you need to compile wxWidgets by yourself.
[07:37] <Pimpshizzled> hey folks, any of u guys know a good method of mounting an iso from a ntfs drive?
[07:37] <HellDragon> dv_, i just compiled it
[07:37] <Rug> test: I was helping you...   Did you try to mount it?
[07:37] <dv_> but look at the wxwidgets packages in the repository, maybe theres one with support for large files
[07:37] <HellDragon> but i dont know how to turn on large file support
[07:37] <dv_> hm
[07:37] <ZeZu> Rug, here is some weidness :
[07:37] <ZeZu>   nvidia-glx: Conflicts: nvidia-settings but 1.0-3ubuntu7 is to be installed
[07:37] <dv_> configure --help ?
[07:37] <Taru> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14441
[07:37] <test> Rug, yes
[07:37] <ZeZu> E: Broken Packages
[07:37] <rob138> amphi, i have build-essential installed, a program i am installing is looking for them and defaults to /usr/src/linux/include and says it's not an existing directory
[07:38] <HellDragon> it says nothing useful dv_
[07:38] <Rug> ZeZu: I had that problem once before, I just nuked & reinstalled.  Sorry I don't know what else to tell you.
[07:38] <dv_> theres no --large-files option or something?
[07:38] <dv_> weird
[07:38] <ZeZu> and i wonder why people say package managers suck, but i've never had this problem before
[07:38] <ZeZu> bah
[07:38] <Rug> Test were you able to mount /dev/hdc2 ?
[07:38] <cyphase> hmm, no custom requests in ShipIt anymore
[07:38] <dv_> try #wxwidgets then
[07:38] <Rug> ZeZu: 90% of the time it is bullet-proof.
[07:39] <Rug> cyphase: Dapper is too near release
[07:39] <cyphase> Rug, what do you mean?
[07:39] <Rug> test: were you able to mount /dev/hdc2 ?
[07:39] <rob138> amphi : What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel?
[07:39] <amphi> rob138: that's looking for kernel headers
[07:39] <test> Rug, i dnt have hdc2 on my system
[07:39] <rob138> amphi, where should i point it?
[07:39] <johnstar> does anyone know if sata is hotplugable in ubuntu?
[07:39] <test> Rug, only hda2
[07:39] <Rug> cyphase: that is my guess.   June 1st Dapper will be released. so there will be NEW CD's
[07:39] <cyphase> Rug, i know..
[07:39] <amphi> rob138: install the kernel-headers package, perhaps
[07:40] <bimberi> rob138: sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[07:40] <cyphase> Rug, with previous versions you could set a custom number of each cd
[07:40] <Rug> test: that is why grub can't mount it.
[07:40] <amphi> rob138: doesn't make any difference what _mine_ is
[07:40] <ZeZu> i'll leave the nvidia-settings out and then just configure it all manually by hand i guess
[07:40] <ZeZu> pain in the ass
[07:40] <Rug> cyphase: ahh sorry
[07:40] <cyphase> Rug, not the version :)
[07:40] <test> Rug, so what shoul i do?
[07:41] <Rug> test: did you have a more then one hard-drive in your PC?
[07:41] <rob138> bimberi, why not apt-get?
[07:41] <bimberi> !aptitude
[07:41] <ubotu> aptitude is another front-end to apt, like apt-get, adept and Synaptic.  Unlike them, aptitude remembers what dependencies were installed with a package and can remove them if you uninstall. It also has a (somewhat buggy) text-mode interface.
[07:41] <test> Rug, nope only one
[07:41] <bimberi> rob138: ^^^^^ :)
[07:41] <HellDragon> iji
[07:41] <Rug> test: then why is grub pointing to hdc2 ?
[07:41] <rob138> bimeri thanks
[07:42] <rob138> what are these headers?
[07:42] <bimberi> rob138: np :)
[07:42] <test> Rug, i dont know
[07:42] <Rug> test: one sec..
[07:43] <test> rUG,OK
[07:43] <bimberi> rob138: that i don't know, those who know C(++) might
[07:44] <Rug> test: Do you knwo what partition your "/" is on?
[07:44] <CaptainMorgan> alrigh, Im resorting to rythmbox... how come I have no sound??
[07:44] <test> Rug, it is on Hda2
[07:44] <CaptainMorgan> other apps and terminals produce sound.. damn GAIM makes sound... but not my audio players..
[07:45] <Rug> test: join #paste
[07:45] <test> Rug, when i type fdisk . these what came out /de/
[07:45] <amphi> rob138: they contain function declarations, macros, defines, etc. for c source files
[07:45] <polopolo> hello all
[07:45] <test> join #paste
[07:45] <test> ok
[07:46] <rob138> amphi, okay
[07:46] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, you have the codecs right?
[07:46] <CaptainMorgan> yep
[07:47] <CaptainMorgan> dammit.. I got it... but that's just weird.. I closed out everything except X-chat and rythmbox.. and sound produced
[07:48] <polopolo> If I sign the code of conduct, i'm then a member of the ubuntu team?
[07:48] <CaptainMorgan> no
[07:48] <CaptainMorgan> ;)
[07:48] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, ahh, you have problems esd hogging your dsp.
[07:48] <CaptainMorgan> dsp?
[07:48] <Samuli^> soundcard.
[07:48] <CaptainMorgan> hm..
[07:48] <test> for my linux ubuntu
[07:49] <test> /dev/hda for my windows
[07:49] <Rug> test: wrong window
[07:49] <test> for my linux
[07:49] <test> /dev/hda for my windows
[07:49] <test> sorry
[07:49] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, for quick solution, try System>Administration>soundsystem switcher or whatever that's called.
[07:49] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, and change it from esd to alsa.
[07:50] <dv_> btw, there is a sound daemon called sid, right?
[07:50] <polopolo> If I sign the code of conduct, i'm then a member of the ubuntu team?
[07:50] <Flannel> No
[07:51] <CaptainMorgan> :)
[07:51] <Flannel> http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember
[07:51] <amphi> polopolo: perhaps it's a necessary but unsifficient condition ;)
[07:51] <polopolo> ok
[07:51] <Flannel> it is!  If youre a member, you have signed the code of Conduct
[07:51] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, see http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#configuresoundproperly
[07:51] <CaptainMorgan> Samuli^, System>Administration>and no soundsystem/audio, or whatever option
[07:51] <CaptainMorgan> oh..
[07:52] <Flannel> Samuli^, CaptainMorgan, ubuntuguide isn't a good resource.
[07:52] <Flannel> use the wiki/forums
[07:52] <varsendagger> hey i want to put a website on the internet
[07:52] <Samuli^> Flannel, it does a good job with that configuration for sound.
[07:52] <varsendagger> i have a computer that i can leave on all the time but i have no idea how to go about tdoing this
[07:53] <Samuli^> I'm not sure why breezy is so crippled by default.
[07:53] <varsendagger> i have a DSL connection
[07:53] <Flannel> varsendagger: you'll want to install [whatever server, apache is common]  configure your router for traffic, and get a DNS (dyndns is a popular one, if youve got a dynamic IP (cable/dsl/etc))
[07:53] <clever_> how do would i go about seting up a finger print reader in ubuntu?
[07:54] <varsendagger> how do i configure my router for traffic?
[07:54] <CaptainMorgan> Flannel.. whoa.. I gotta reboot?
[07:54] <Flannel> varsendagger: you'll want to port forward 80
[07:54] <Flannel> CaptainMorgan: erm,what?
[07:54] <clever_> foward port 80 to the pc thats running the server
[07:55] <CaptainMorgan> says so in that link
[07:55] <Flannel> varsendagger: unless you want to change the port to something else.
[07:55] <adamc> what packge needs installed to get stander posix development docs
[07:55] <adamc> ie man print/write/perror etc
[07:55] <varsendagger> ok this is shounding too difficult   alll i have is a dsl modem
[07:55] <T`> i get swap device not found when i try to hibernate
[07:56] <T`> and mount deosnt show my swap (/dev/hda6) mounted
[07:56] <T`> but i have an entry in fstab
[07:56] <rawhead> hi all
[07:56] <clever_> ahh then you can skip the router stuff varsendagger
[07:56] <T`> anyone know why this happens?
[07:56] <varsendagger> yes
[07:56] <Flannel> varsendagger: it's reallynot.  you need a server (thats the software, since you already have the hardware) you need to allow the outside world to communicate with it (thats the router bit) then you need to allow the outsideworld to be able to find it, that's the dyndns part
[07:56] <clever_> T` the swap is never mounted
[07:57] <T`> clever_, oh.. actually in /proc/swaps i see /dev/hda6 partition 2040212 0 -1
[07:57] <Ademan> anyone here use anjuta?
[07:57] <Flannel> varsendagger: if you don't have a router, do you expect to have two PCs online all the time?
[07:57] <clever_> Flannel, if varsendagger has just a dsl box wired right into the pc he wont need a router opened up
[07:57] <T`> clever_, then why is hibernate complaining.. hmm
[07:57] <CaptainMorgan> Flannel.. hmm... I just restarted rythmbox and it's playing.. I don't see a need to reboot... at least not right now..
[07:57] <CaptainMorgan> phew
[07:57] <varsendagger> ok i will be right back
[07:57] <Flannel> CaptainMorgan, it was Samuli^ who was helping you, not me ;)
[07:57] <CaptainMorgan> ooops
[07:58] <CaptainMorgan> Samuli^, :)
[07:58] <varsendagger> funny storry i can't get my cd burner working and i need to get 170mb of web page to a guy
[07:58] <Samuli^> I just want peeps to mess up their computers :)
[07:58] <clever_> how do would i go about seting up a finger print reader in ubuntu?
[07:58] <CaptainMorgan> !!
[07:58] <ubotu> CaptainMorgan: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[07:58] <CaptainMorgan> oops..
[07:58] <Samuli^> hehe.
[07:58] <Flannel> varsendagger: ah.  ok.  get apache, (apt-get install apache2) and put the stuff in /var/www then give the guy your  IP addy.
[07:59] <CaptainMorgan> Samuli^, that resource wanted me to reboot after config.. bleh
[07:59] <Flannel> varsendagger: and, that's basically it ;)
[07:59] <varsendagger> what is my ipADDy
[07:59] <clever_> www.whatismyip.com
[07:59] <varsendagger> Vars is men too
[07:59] <vars> look i'm in two places !!!!
[07:59] <vars> me
[07:59] <CaptainMorgan> no!
[07:59] <vars> anyway
[08:00] <Icomey> I've got a question.
[08:00] <Samuli^> CaptainMorgan, the thing is that esd was hogging your dsp and now that nothing else uses it, you have sound in rhythbox. I think you do need a reboot to get it working in a non-hogging way, but you can do that later.
[08:00] <CaptainMorgan> cool, thanks
[08:00] <clever_> my sound card randomly plays the audio at 200% normal speed
[08:00] <vars> ok apache is being installed
[08:00] <clever_> any way to fix it?
[08:01] <Flannel> clever_: that's not a soundcard problem, I dont think.
[08:01] <clever_> its within linux drivers area
[08:01] <clever_> normaly mplayer ends up playing the audio at 200% speed
[08:01] <clever_> and gaim cant make any sounds
[08:01] <clever_> and it fixes itself randomly
[08:02] <Flannel> google help any?
[08:02] <Icomey> I have Ubuntu installed on a 13 GB hdc, and I want to format a 40 GB hdd for use as file storage (pictures, music, etc.).
[08:02] <clever_> didnt try google
[08:02] <clever_> just had a talk about it in #mplayer
[08:02] <Flannel> clever_: seems unique enough that google would be helpful
[08:02] <clever_> i just set mplayer to 50% speed
[08:02] <clever_> and the card doubles it bringing it back to 100
[08:02] <clever_> the lazy way to fix it:P
[08:03] <Ademan> so no one here uses anjuta?
[08:03] <Icomey> Ademan, what is anjuta?
[08:03] <HymnToLife> !anjuta
[08:03] <ubotu> Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, HymnToLife
[08:03] <jcsston> how hard would it be to upgrade a driver written for the 2.4 linux kernel to 2.6?
[08:03] <vars> what is anjunta that sounds familiar
[08:03] <khaled> hi.. when i use apt-get, i get a message saying E: Broken packages
[08:04] <khaled> what might cause that ?
[08:04] <Ademan> Icomey: its an IDE
[08:04] <Ademan> for c and c++
[08:04] <HymnToLife> even Ubotu the Allmight doesn't know bout it
[08:04] <jeremie_> salut a tou
[08:04] <HymnToLife> +y
[08:04] <HymnToLife> !fr
[08:04] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:04] <clever_> ubotu cant even help me with my finger print reader
[08:04] <jeremie_> yes
[08:04] <ubotu> I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, clever_
[08:04] <clever_> see:P
[08:04] <vars> Flannel, ok i have apache2 installed and my index.htm and files in /var/www
[08:04] <HymnToLife> ubotu is stupid
[08:04] <jeremie_> thanks man
[08:04] <ubotu> HymnToLife: Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[08:05] <vars> i don't have x on the comp i want to use as the server is there a way to get the ip addy?
[08:05] <clever_> wget www.whatismyip.com
[08:06] <clever_> then cat  or less or vi the file it makes
[08:06] <Ademan> the ip of the comp?
[08:06] <Ademan> in the console type "route"
[08:06] <clever_> ifconfig may work if the dsl is right on the linux box
[08:06] <clever_> on my system that just gives me 192.168.1.1 and 255.255.255.0
[08:06] <Ademan> and route didnt do the trick
[08:06] <Ademan> yeah no
[08:06] <Ademan> lol
[08:07] <clever_> ifconfig or wget www.whatismyip.com
[08:07] <clever_> or try using links as a text browser
[08:07] <Ademan> ifconfig wont do it either if you're behind even one router
[08:07] <clever_> yeah
[08:07] <clever_> which is why i said if the dsl is right on the linux box
[08:07] <CaptainMorgan> this may sound stupid.. but I got a 250 gig ext hdd backup that's ntfs, is the process for partitioning it in say.. half for linux as simple as internal installations?
[08:07] <HymnToLife> but if you're behint a router you certainly have other boxes on your network
[08:08] <h3h_timo> does anyone use dijjer?
[08:08] <Icomey> I have an extra hard drive that I is under /dev/hdd that I want to format for data such as pictures or music or whatnot. How would I go about doing that?
[08:08] <vars> clever_, ok i got it
[08:08] <Icomey> I have an extra hard drive that is under /dev/hdd that I want to format for data such as pictures or music or whatnot. How would I go about doing that?
[08:08] <vars> my ip addres that is
[08:08] <Icomey> There.
[08:09] <Icomey> Wait.
[08:09] <Ademan> where does wget put stuff?
[08:09] <clever_> current directory
[08:09] <khaled> Ademan, .
[08:09] <clever_> ls -ltr
[08:09] <clever_> look at the last edited file which ls -ltr should list last
[08:09] <vars> clever_, what do i do next?
[08:10] <clever_> open that ip in a web browser and you should see the files you put under /var/www/
[08:10] <vars> i am on the same network
[08:10] <clever_> that should make it a bit easyer/faster
[08:10] <vars> it gives me info about my modem
[08:10] <clever_> what is the ip?
[08:10] <HymnToLife> vars > the enter the network IP
[08:11] <Mantice> When does dapper come out
[08:11] <CaptainMorgan> !dapper
[08:11] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[08:11] <HymnToLife> most likely 192.168.x.
[08:11] <Flannel> HymnToLife: no.
[08:11] <clever_> also irc isnt very secure and i can see that vars's ip on the web is 209.181.2.222
[08:11] <Mantice> noooooooooooooooo
[08:11] <vars> hey that is it
[08:11] <Mantice> What is Ubuntu 6.06 LTS ?
[08:11] <T`> anyone know how to turn the fan off on a laptop? its ALWAYS on for me :(
[08:11] <Flannel> Mantice: Dapper.
[08:11] <HymnToLife> Flannel> why no ?
[08:11] <Mantice> Whats LTS ?
[08:11] <disinterseted_pe> i cant get streamlink to work
[08:12] <rob138> wow, so i tried to install vmware player and it destroyed my system,  how do i remove it from starting with the kernel it installed itself to?
[08:12] <Flannel> HymnToLife: because he's not behind a router.  That'd be his subnet
[08:12] <vars> i don;t know
[08:12] <clever_> T`, my cpu fan is off but turns on when it heats up and i forget where i changed it
[08:12] <Flannel> Mantice: Long Time Support, or Long Term, or something like that.
[08:12] <clever_> i think its in my bios
[08:12] <T`> clever_, thats what i need!
[08:12] <crimsun> Mantice: long term support.
[08:12] <T`> clever_, really? bios .. hmm
[08:12] <clever_> im on a dell laptop
[08:12] <T`> on acer here
[08:12] <clever_> both of my dells do that
[08:12] <Mantice> So if I order it now from ship it when its released it will come in the mail ?
[08:13] <Flannel> Mantice: yes, shipit orders are for dapper.  They wont be sent until after june1, obviously.
[08:13] <vars> ok cai just tried to run apache2 and it said permission denied   could not bind to address [::]  :80
[08:13] <Mantice> Yeah
[08:13] <Mantice> Thanks Fannel
[08:13] <Flannel> vars: it's already running
[08:13] <vars> good
[08:13] <vars> can anyone see my website
[08:14] <clever_> your router i think is blocking every1
[08:14] <vars> well that is cute
[08:14] <clever_> you can only access from a pc thats on your side of the router
[08:14] <HymnToLife> vars> you have to forward port 80
[08:14] <clever_> till you edit the security
[08:14] <vars> HymnToLife, please tell me how to do that
[08:15] <HymnToLife> vars > depends on your router, RTFM ;)
[08:15] <dmizer> for the love of pete, can someone tell me how to stop my vmware server?
[08:15] <clever_> i got a site which explains on about 200 diferent routers
[08:16] <clever_> vars, check http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm
[08:16] <rob138> can someone please help me remove vmware from my system?
[08:16] <HellDragon> hi
[08:16] <clever_> rob138, where did you get vmware for linux?
[08:16] <HellDragon> how can i lauch amule ? i type amule and it doesnt work (in console)
[08:16] <disinterseted_pe> does anyone know which mplayer works with windows media streamlink?
[08:16] <rob138> clever_ from vmware.com
[08:17] <Ademan> HellDragon: i just do it from Applications->Internet->aMule
[08:17] <HellDragon> its not there ademan
[08:17] <rob138> clever_ it's the player
[08:17] <clever_> player?
[08:18] <vars> clever_, ii got the right make and modle   what am i looking for?
[08:19] <vars> ahh i see now
[08:19] <rob138> clever_ VMWare palyer
[08:19] <rob138> if i remove /etc/init.d/vmware will vmware stop from starting when i start ubuntu?
[08:20] <elkbuntu> HymnToLife, that was an inappropriate way to say that
[08:20] <dmizer> rob: didn't seem to help me any.
[08:20] <HymnToLife> to say what ?
[08:21] <elkbuntu> <HymnToLife> vars > depends on your router, RTFM ;)
[08:21] <elkbuntu> we do not use that four letter acronym here
[08:21] <rob138> dmizer huh?
[08:21] <HellDragon> i bet you feel nuts elkbuntu
[08:21] <elkbuntu> HellDragon, eh?
[08:21] <vars> what does RTFM mean?
[08:21] <dmizer> rob: i can't get rid of vmware either.
[08:21] <HymnToLife> !rtfm
[08:21] <ubotu> HymnToLife: Do they come in packets of five. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[08:21] <elkbuntu> vars it means: read the * manual
[08:21] <clever_> read the f... manual
[08:22] <elkbuntu> fill in the star
[08:22] <vars> ok i agree i should read the manua;
[08:22] <HymnToLife> elkbuntu> notice the smiley right after it
[08:22] <rob138> dmizer, crap. i really want to
[08:22] <dmizer> i don't know what file stars the **** thing, but it's persistent.
[08:22] <elkbuntu> actually derived from 'read the fsck manpage' or so i've been told
[08:22] <rob138> dmizer, yeah now i can't boot the kernel it installed itself to cuz it'll either freeze or kill my internet
[08:23] <elkbuntu> HymnToLife, the term should still not be used, it's arrogant and rude
[08:23] <rob138> shit
[08:23] <dmizer> kills my internet too.
[08:23] <dmizer> because it creates a network bridge
=== dv_____ is now known as dv_
[08:23] <rob138> dmizer, oh thats what that is
[08:23] <rob138> dmizer, so what do you do?
[08:24] <dmizer> rob: i haven't completely figured it out yet, but it doesn't start the bridge with interfaces.
[08:24] <vars> ok that website that clever_  gave me explainde what port forwarding is but not how
[08:24] <rob138> dmizer, what do you mean
[08:24] <clever_> under the fowarding link in the top list it should show how to do it for nearly all routers
[08:25] <dmizer> rob: network devices are enabled during boot through an interfaces file in /etc/network called interfaces.
[08:25] <dmizer> rob: but vmware enables it's network bridge somewher else.
[08:26] <rob138> dmizer, right i know that, but then there is a vmware service that starts the vmnet services that kill the other /etc/network ones
[08:26] <rob138> i think?
[08:26] <elkbuntu> hmm.. i havent cleaned old kernels out since i installed... iirc you just do the complete removal for the ones no longer needed, right?
[08:26] <dmizer> rob: that is exactly correct, and i can't find it.
[08:26] <dmizer> rob: i'd like to put a bullet in it's head ... lol

[08:27] <rob138> dmizer, it wasn't /etc/init.d/vmware? agreed, i am kicking myself for installing it, i had a solid system until this little fucker
[08:27] <khaled> Icomey, fat16
[08:27] <Icomey> Will that work for 40 GB?
[08:27] <Samuli^> Icomey, If it's just for Ubuntu, then ext3

[08:31] <slackern> vars: you could just wget the file and edit it
[08:31] <Samuli^> Aqui1a, most programs etc. work in kde and in gnome, but well.. it's just better to use gnome apps in gnome and kde apps in kde.
[08:31] <slackern> vars: otherwise you have links and lynx for cli http browsing.

[08:56] <dreamthief> is all your data on one partition? @ HellDragon
[08:57] <dreamthief> or do u have multiple partitions and only root needs to be resized?
[08:57] <HellDragon> everything is on /
[08:57] <dreamthief> lol

[08:58] <Icomey> I have a friend who might be able to help.
[08:58] <HellDragon> dreamthief, NO not partition magic
[08:58] <HellDragon> it breaks grub everytime
[08:58] <dreamthief> :-P
[08:58] <HellDragon> i passed 3hrs to repair it today after using part magicv
[08:58] <Icomey> noiesmo: Thanks for the help.
[08:58] <noiesmo> Icomey, in terminal type man mkfs.reiserfs
[08:58] <tangent> anyone know what config file the "ignore host list" feature in network proxy prefs uses?
[08:59] <dreamthief> then use a live cd to restore grub
[08:59] <HellDragon> it took 3hrs to restore it
[08:59] <HellDragon> on a livecd
[08:59] <noiesmo> Icomey, if its on your system then mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hxx

[09:00] <HellDragon> yes
[09:00] <HellDragon> it had a lot of problems
[09:00] <dreamthief> and next time you install linux you should really should have read about file systems and partitions before
[09:00] <Icomey> noiesmo: Thank you, it worked.
[09:00] <noiesmo> Icomey, np :)
[09:00] <Icomey> And now to mount it.

[09:01] <GTroy> how do I compile something in java?
[09:01] <slackern> vars_: that will forward those ports for you if you make sure eth0 is correct external interface and change the ip adress

[09:04] <spikeb> yeah, stupid frostwire doesn't run with classpath
[09:04] <Taru> I keep having to add those 2 in repo everytime I get back in synaptic.
[09:04] <Taru> I thought it would save.
[09:04] <dreamthief> everybody messes around with linux but most of them don't have the slightest clue about what they're doing ... doing bullshit because of an lack of knowledge and then crying for help :-(
[09:04] <GTroy> I don't think it matters taru
[09:04] <Taru> GTroy, hmm
[09:04] <slackern> vars_: well do please share the information if it's needed does it use ppp or something as a external interface?
[09:05] <noiesmo> Taru, on my site is the java and frostwire info you need http://noiesmo.dnsalias.net/index.php?topic=Gnulinux
[09:05] <Taru> GTroy, So, what is the solution? that command was to update to most current Java.
[09:05] <slackern> in that case it should be ppp instead of eth0
[09:05] <disinterseted_pe> ok how do i install realplayer 10?
[09:05] <vars_> slackern, can i make those adjustments and then just chmod a+x and ./ that script

[09:32] <asdx> hi
[09:32] <asdx> does anyone knows how to delete all the iptables rules
[09:32] <thenetduck> is anyone here a computer engineering major?
[09:32] <rob138> seq, good info, i googled and found that there are "things" (for lack of better word right now) that allow windows and osx to read ext2, would that be a good direction to go?
[09:32] <asdx> or disable a nat rule
[09:32] <noiesmo> Taru, no probs :)
[09:33] <La_PaRCa> asdx, iptables -F all
[09:33] <slvmchn> can someone help me? when i try to view a webpage in firefox that has a video in it, the window shows up and the little slider bar/play button, but it says something about totem not being able to open it
[09:33] <slvmchn> or sometimes just says nothing
[09:33] <Icomey> noiesmo: So, shall I set mine up similarly?
[09:33] <slackern> brb
[09:33] <Seq> rob138: i have a mac, but have not tried ext2 reading with it. i have used the windows ext2 filesystem driver, it works pretty well, aside from throwing a RECYCLED folder on each partition :p
[09:33] <thenetduck> slvmchn you don't have the correct codecs for your video player
[09:33] <noiesmo> Icomey, just add what you need for yours
[09:33] <thenetduck> you need to install them
[09:33] <Seq> rob138: but if you ever take the machine to somebody elses house, they won't have the driver
[09:33] <slvmchn> thenetduck: i can watch .mpegs in xine no problem though, how do apply the codecs to totem?
[09:33] <La_PaRCa> thenetduck, why did you need a comp eng?
[09:34] <Seq> rob138: the device, rather
[09:34] <noiesmo> Icomey, I gotta head off for a while I'll be back later
[09:34] <Icomey> Okay.
[09:34] <rob138> seq, would fat32 be alright if it was purely for music/videos/files that don't need permissions ?
[09:34] <asdx> La_PaRCa: iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
[09:34] <Icomey> noiesmo:
[09:34] <Icomey> one more thing quickly
[09:34] <thenetduck> go to command line try typeing this in.....   sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
[09:34] <La_PaRCa> asdx, then just iptables -F
[09:34] <noiesmo> Icomey, yes
[09:34] <Icomey> type is reiserfs?
[09:34] <Seq> rob138: yeah, i use fat32 on all my removable drives
[09:35] <noiesmo> Icomey, replace ext3 with reiserfs
[09:35] <rob138> seq, thanks
[09:35] <Icomey> noiesmo: Okay, thanks
[09:35] <Icomey> noiesmo: You've been a great help.
[09:35] <asdx> La_PaRCa: my computer in the network is still having internet access...

[09:35] <thenetduck> ok
[09:35] <JoshRA> Hello??
[09:35] <slvmchn> Hello!
[09:35] <La_PaRCa> asdx, it shouldnt
[09:36] <asdx> La_PaRCa: yeah, weird

[09:38] <slvmchn> thenetduck: looked like it installed some stuff when i did that line, but still, no luck with the movies
[09:39] <eggzeck> para_site, dpkg -i *.deb
[09:39] <thenetduck> what movie is it?
[09:39] <eggzeck> para_site, where '*' is replaced with package name.
[09:39] <thenetduck> i mean where is the movie?
[09:39] <slvmchn> thenetduck: i'm not seriously concerned about it though, just more annoying than anything, most things i can watch in xine, it's just annoying for sites that have the movie embedded and don't allow download
[09:39] <para_site> eggzeck , yes but what about the .dsc and .changes file
[09:39] <slvmchn> anything
[09:39] <slvmchn> i can only watch flashes
[09:39] <thenetduck> hum ..
[09:39] <slvmchn> doesn't matter if it's .mpeg or .avi or what, if i want to watch it i have to download it
[09:39] <slvmchn> and use xine
[09:39] <para_site> eggzeck , don't we need to touch those ?
[09:39] <slvmchn> no biggie
[09:40] <thenetduck> i have my default web media player xine
[09:40] <slackern> back
[09:40] <thenetduck> maby you can try doing that

[09:43] <edulix> this gives me "permission denied": sudo /bin/echo 4 > /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling
[09:43] <edulix>  understand that the problem is that I execute /bin/echo 4 with sude, but the redirection is being executed wth my current user ?
[09:43] <La_PaRCa> !dma
[09:43] <thenetduck> does this show up red?
[09:43] <La_PaRCa> asdx, its easy by ip. I recommend you google for an iptables howto
[09:43] <vars_> no
[09:44] <slackern> vars_: I would recommend reading up a bit on shorewall since it's quite easy to understand and maintain when you've understood the documentation for it, i spent a day with it and reading guides and such
[09:44] <La_PaRCa> disinterseted_pe, try this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DMA
[09:45] <vars_> that is coo

[09:46] <slackern> vars_: thats what i used before and it was working fine for over a year here until i felt lucky and went for a dapper install on the router :)
[09:46] <slackern> vars_: No how did you do?
[09:47] <slackern> edulix: you could try starting 'sudo -i' then doing '/bin/echo 4 > /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling'
[09:48] <RemyLaptop> asdx - never mind, I have to go out now :-)  thanks anyway
[09:48] <asdx> k
[09:48] <asdx> :P
[09:48] <edulix> slackern: but in that case I'm changing to root user. what I want is something I can then configure in /etc/sudoers to let edulix user execute without even asking a password
[09:49] <asdx> anytime
[09:49] <slackern> edulix: ahh maybe make a bashscript for it and run that with sudo?

[09:50] <vars_> i'm nuts
[09:50] <thenetduck> hey whats the command to edit your source list
[09:50] <edulix> slackern: that's funny, because that is exactly what I was doing in the beguining, executing in a bash script
[09:50] <slackern> vars_: hehe, theres nothing like fixing a problem with another problem and then another :)
[09:50] <vars_> yeah
[09:51] <vars_> 170 mb
[09:51] <vars_> f*
[09:51] <slackern> vars_: so what you need is to move a 170mb file to another machine to burn?
[09:51] <edulix> fixed, someone in #bash told me a solution
[09:51] <edulix> sudo bash -c "/bin/echo 3 > /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling"
[09:52] <slackern> edulix: ahh nice
[09:52] <thenetduck> i get this problem everytime i update W: Couldn't stat source package list http://koti.mbnet.fi breezy/ Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/koti.mbnet.fi_%7eots_ubuntu_breezy_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
[09:52] <thenetduck> i think the source files don't work ?
[09:52] <thenetduck> how do delete them...

[10:19] <erik_m> u checked the package names against ubuntu packages (inet site)
[10:19] <xbmodder_lappy> where is the build-essentials package in ubuntu?
=== orangey is now known as OrangeSun
[10:19] <nn04> i wish i could figure it out, everything else no problem, only problem i have is java
[10:20] <nn04> and the apt-get thing, but thats part of my java problem
[10:20] <alsa> polplak : how do i stop the syncing of the clock to the internet at boot ?
[10:20] <xbmodder_lappy> lol
[10:20] <erik_m> u in gnome ?
[10:20] <nn04> corrent
[10:20] <nn04> *correct
[10:21] <erik_m> in sys TOP admin theres a package manager
[10:21] <erik_m> bit easier to use than apt-get
[10:21] <alsa> polpak, u there ?
[10:22] <nn04> only problem is, synaptic package manager (what i think your talking about) doesnt know what fakeroot and make-jpkg is
[10:22] <polpak> alsa: remove /etc/rcS.d/S51ntpdate
[10:22] <m_0_r_0_n> How can I check if dma is enabled?
[10:22] <xbmodder_lappy> where is the build-essentials package in ubuntu?
[10:22] <xbmodder_lappy> E: Couldn't find package nmap
[10:22] <erik_m> thats prob cause ur reps arent set up :)
[10:22] <xbmodder_lappy> where is nmap..
[10:22] <xbmodder_lappy> erik_m, how do I do that?
[10:22] <alsa> much thanks
[10:23] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: it's build-essential btw
[10:23] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: not build-essentials
[10:23] <xbmodder_lappy> E: Couldn't find package build-essential
[10:23] <erik_m> in synaptic package manager got settings > reps
[10:23] <xbmodder_lappy> this is a headless
[10:23] <KDEfanboy> any easy way to get the aRts plugin for xine?
[10:23] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: you need to change /etc/sources.list
[10:24] <xbmodder_lappy> add what...
[10:24] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: err /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:24] <polpak> !sources

[10:24] <FarrisG> what's the deal with winesetuptk forcing the removal of wine and libwine?
[10:24] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: get the "Official sources.lists"
[10:24] <aftertaf> anyon hot on migrating root fs to evms?
[10:24] <polpak> xbmodder_lappy: or probably more likely, comment the CD repository and uncomment the main repo
[10:25] <xbmodder_lappy> ok

[10:26] <brn> Hello:  Does anyone here have an Epson C88 printer?
[10:26] <polpak> sandy16: if they're not in a terminal window I'm not sure you can
[10:26] <Taru> How do I make Amarok play MP3s?
[10:27] <Taru> Apparently it won't play any of my Mp3s...
[10:27] <polpak> sandy16: if they're in X and have a gui terminal open you can send messages with write
[10:27] <spikeb> !mp3
[10:27] <ubotu> mp3 is, like, a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[10:27] <nn04> lol, erik youll never guess why apt-get wasnt working, and your gonna wanna hit me when i tell ya :-D
[10:28] <erik_m> ok nn04 lol ??
[10:28] <sandy16> polpak: somebody has suggested me to use "xmessage" but it is not working from a remote terminal
=== olive is now known as olive_
[10:28] <nn04> was typing apt-get install, needed to type sudo apt-get install
=== olive_ is now known as olive
[10:28] <erik_m> 8-) lol no worries :) you got it sorted the main thing
[10:28] <erik_m> when im running a few things in apt-get i run sudo su first to put me in root
[10:29] <erik_m> dont need sudo then
[10:29] <sandy16> polpak: are you about to suggest me the write command in bash?
[10:29] <erik_m> but remember to exit when ur done root
[10:29] <vmadmin> hey
[10:29] <polpak> sandy16: write works yes
[10:29] <linuxneophyte> mp3
[10:29] <vmadmin> what does a encrypte file system mean in real terms
[10:29] <nn04> still having a problem with make-jpkg tho
[10:29] <erik_m> cant find package ?
[10:30] <polpak> vmadmin: means the filesystem is encrypted
[10:30] <brn> Where can I find a driver (or better yet, the escape-sequences) for an Epson C88 printer?
[10:30] <vmadmin> polpak: how you write read and exe to an excrpted file system please
[10:31] <polpak> vmadmin: you don't.. You have to have the kernel do it for you
[10:31] <vmadmin> encrypted
[10:31] <KDEfanboy> i hope i won't have to compile the aRts plugin for Xine to get it.. maybe there's a version in an official respository somewhere?
[10:31] <erik_m> nn04 whats the problem with the make-jpkg package ?
[10:31] <linuxneophyte> I can't remember how to ask ubotu a question...
[10:31] <polpak> vmadmin: typically the kernel is configured to know that the filesystem is encrypted, and when it mounts it initially it will prompt for a password. If you don't have the right password it cannot be mounted (read, etc)
[10:32] <polpak> vmadmin: it can still be wiped.. but the data is protected from unauthorized reading
[10:32] <nn04> cant find it
[10:32] <nn04> sorry was running a quick search but yea it cant find the make-jpkg package
[10:32] <erik_m> brn : i think you can setup epson printers in system > admin > printing
[10:32] <vmadmin> polpak ; i saw this how to here http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Encrypted_Filesystem might give it a try
[10:33] <erik_m> nn04 try http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto to add more reps
[10:33] <polpak> vmadmin: make sure you have backups of your data.. if you screw it up, you will have a hard/impossible time repairing it ;p
[10:33] <vmadmin> polpak; its on bb 5-10
[10:33] <rencrash> is there a way that i could backup my ubuntu settings and apps that i have installed ont it so if i had to redo it i dont need to redo everything?
[10:33] <vmadmin> polpak: if you look at url its a clean start
[10:34] <erik_m> might be the package is in univers multiverse etc and ur source list doesnt include those reps
[10:34] <nn04> o ic, will try that, be back in 5
[10:34] <KenSentMe> In Nautilus i've connected to Samba shares, but in Firefox the shares are not connected. How can i make sure that i can access my files on those shares in Firefox?
[10:34] <polpak> vmadmin: ok then. have fun =)
[10:34] <erik_m> kl gl with it nn04
[10:34] <jerware> is there a way to have module-assistant to use my latest version of gcc?
[10:34] <jerware> like the one it is pointing to alreay?
[10:35] <vmadmin> polpak: i will :)
[10:35] <jerware> and not the old version?
[10:35] <mindframe> alguien sabe cual es el canal de ubuntu en espaol????
[10:35] <linuxneophyte> How does one ask Ubotu a questio?
[10:35] <qzzhong> 
[10:36] <vmadmin> polpak: say i get it up and running then install vmware that might be another story?
[10:36] <mindframe> alguien sabe cual es el canal de ubuntu en espaol????
[10:36] <brn> eric_m:  Thanks but I have tried that.  The printer works with an 'alternate' driver but features are missing.  I think I goofed when I bought the critter but here I am.
[10:36] <jerware> qzzhong:  this is america. speak english
[10:36] <polpak> vmadmin: if linux is the hosting OS you should be fine
[10:36] <mindframe> somebody knows how is de ubuntu channel in spanish?
[10:37] <vmadmin> polpack: yes its bb 5-10 server
[10:37] <erik_m> brn there is a linux driver for epson out there will have a quick look
[10:37] <linuxneophyte> jerware: While I agree that typing in a foreign language isn't useful, perhaps you could be a little more PC about it.  And who's to say any of us are in America?
[10:37] <nn04> lol sweet it worked, didnt realize that i didnt enable all of the repositories
[10:37] <slackern> !es
[10:37] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[10:38] <slackern> that's for you mindframe
[10:38] <erik_m> nn04  good stuff
[10:38] <hyphenated> linuxneophyte: you just send a private message to ubotu
[10:38] <mindframe> ok, thanks!!
[10:38] <erik_m> yeah most ppl skip over the reps hihi
[10:38] <nn04> thanks a lot erik, owe you one
[10:38] <jerware> linuxneophyte:  :P
[10:38] <erik_m> its ok
[10:38] <asdx> how can i block www.somesite.com access in some computer of my network?
[10:39] <linuxneophyte> Thanks hyphenated.
[10:39] <polpak> asdx: depends on how your network is configured
[10:39] <erik_m> brn u still about ?
[10:39] <asdx> polpak: it's a basic configuration
[10:40] <polpak> asdx: define "basic"
[10:40] <hyphenated> asdx: there's no 'basic' solution. the simplest is to add www.somesite.com to your /etc/hosts file
[10:40] <hyphenated> with an IP address that doesn't work. but that's a crap way
[10:40] <bigfoot1> i can't access ubuntuforums.org. anybody else with this problem?
[10:40] <polpak> hyphenated: he wants to prevent access from a different computer
[10:40] <asdx> yeah
[10:40] <hyphenated> ok, so add it in that machine's /etc/hosts file
[10:41] <brn> eric_m:  I know I stumbled when I bought the Epson.  I never considered that they would sell a printer that could not print.  I am mortified. Epson "Customer Service" is dissapointng.  The thing works but...
[10:41] <asdx> the other machine has windows
[10:41] <polpak> asdx: windows has a hosts file
[10:41] <erik_m> brn http://www.avasys.jp/english/linux_e/dl_ink.html
[10:41] <erik_m> might help ya a bit :))
[10:41] <hyphenated> if it's worth your time, you'd install a proxy, and force other machines to use the proxy by blocking direct access to the internet
[10:41] <asdx> heh
[10:41] <sandy16> linuxneophyte: hey can u suggest me a method to send a messge to a user (loggedin at GUI) and me using a remote terminal connection
[10:41] <bigfoot1> www.ubuntuforums.org <--- can anybody access this site, or is it just me?
[10:41] <polpak> hyphenated: or if he's natting, he can block it with iptables
[10:41] <erik_m> brn : cant mind what model ya said but it might be in there
[10:42] <asdx> i'm natting
[10:42] <bigfoot1> http://www.ubuntuforums.org <--- can anybody access this site, or is it just me?
[10:42] <asdx> how can i do with iptables?
[10:42] <bigfoot1> sorry
[10:42] <bigfoot1> for dbl post
[10:42] <polpak> asdx: you're natting with your linux box?
[10:42] <asdx> yeah
[10:42] <autosuggested> bigfoot1: Apparently there have been a few problems with the site recently.
[10:42] <polpak> asdx: i.e. all the other computers route through the linux box?
[10:42] <hyphenated> asdx: does the site have a fixed address?
[10:42] <vmadmin> polpak: just one last question if you at the end of the url i posted it says after the filesystem is encrypted apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, in my case i will run this script that installs a vmware ready sysyem from here http://www.howtoforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=5   sory for lng question
[10:42] <erik_m> brn : for distro try debian might work (should work) although might not lol
[10:42] <autosuggested> bigfoot1: At least once a week the site seems to be down.
[10:42] <asdx> polpak: yes
[10:42] <vmadmin> look
[10:42] <bigfoot1> autosuggested: is that so?
[10:42] <polpak> hyphenated: you can use a dns name with iptables I think
[10:42] <bigfoot1> i didn't know that, autosuggested
[10:43] <asdx> hyphenated: fixed address?
[10:43] <autosuggested> bigfoot1: It seems to be up at the moment though.
[10:43] <lhb> bigfoot1: works here
[10:43] <bigfoot1> yes, it's working since 5 seconds ago
[10:43] <asdx> i want to know how to block via the mac address
[10:43] <bigfoot1> but it's slov
[10:43] <lhb> indeed
[10:43] <bigfoot1> is there a way to make other websites think that i have a USA ip address
[10:43] <bigfoot1> ?
[10:44] <autosuggested> bigfoot1: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=178528
[10:44] <vars_> !frostfire
[10:44] <polpak> bigfoot1: route through a proxy server in the us somewhere
[10:44] <ubotu> vars_: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[10:44] <slackern> bigfoot1: i think you can have geoip blocking in iptables
[10:44] <autosuggested> bigfoot1: That's about ubuntuforums, not your problem.
[10:44] <bigfoot1> autosuggested: yes. i know. it's a totally differnt question
[10:44] <slackern> bigfoot1: oh nm, i missread :)
[10:45] <polpak> vmadmin: you can try. I don't use vmware.. so I don't know if it'll work
[10:45] <bigfoot1> i want to check out ABC (TV channel)'s free tv programs and i want to get skype to allow me to make the free USA to USA pc to phone calls
[10:45] <vmadmin> plopak; i run the script already it works its just the encrypted side
[10:46] <bigfoot1> oh, and napster's full-length preview is only for USA.
[10:46] <xbmodder_lappy> asdx, why?
[10:46] <xbmodder_lappy> bigfoot1, how much will you pay for usa IP?
[10:46] <erik_m> brn : you get the driver working ?
=== karl is now known as Znarl
[10:47] <bigfoot1> xbmodder_lappy: how much should i pay for usa ip?
[10:47] <vmadmin> polpak: how is an encrypted sysyem a deterent against hacking, spoofinf etc
[10:47] <erik_m> tbigfoot1 there are free us proxys out there
[10:47] <erik_m> google for them
[10:48] <bigfoot1> erik_m: i wouldn't know how to use them though
=== clausen is now known as skeffen
[10:48] <erik_m> dare i ask y u want a us ip hihi , most us want ip outside us hihi
[10:49] <brn> eric_m:  I just copied the URL you mentioned.  I'll try it and get back.  Thanks
[10:49] <xbmodder_lappy> bigfoot1, 25
[10:49] <bigfoot1> erik_m; 3 reasons as of now: 1) i want to check out ABC (TV channel)'s free tv programs and 2) i want to get skype to allow me to make the free USA to USA pc to phone calls 3)  napster's full-length music preview is only for USA.
[10:49] <erik_m> ok brn just wanted to make sure u seen the message lol good luck
[10:49] <bigfoot1> xbmodder_lappy: what about 25?
[10:50] <bigfoot1> erik_m: why do you want a non-USA ip?
[10:50] <xbmodder_lappy> $25/month and I'll give you .5 mbit/sec of traffic
[10:50] <xbmodder_lappy> bigfoot1, get a VPS
[10:50] <xbmodder_lappy> and setup openVPN
[10:50] <erik_m> bigfoot unless u get a private proxy which will cost , cause free proxys tend to full and loaded and usless for anything needing bandwidth

[11:02] <erik_m> i have a connection being shared from ubuntu , i have setup ipmasq and dnsmasq and both running and i put on a dhcp server that works nicely but traffic that is going into the ubuntu box from other computers  gets out but traffic back into the network from inet doesnt ??
[11:02] <erik_m> i think it could be my routing tables but i cant seem to figure why any ideas ?
[11:03] <salkot> maybe you need to NAT?
[11:03] <dave__> hello everybody
[11:03] <salkot> how do you know that traffic from other computers gets out to th einternet?
[11:04] <ubuntu_> Hello
[11:04] <ubuntu_> Is it possible to boot the ubuntu live cd into RAM ?
[11:04] <erik_m> watching the traffic levels in ifconfig ppp0
[11:04] <vars_> hey can somone go to this website 209.181.2.222
[11:04] <dave__> yes checkout the f2 menu
[11:05] <erik_m> not the best way but it should the corresponding data going out and back
[11:05] <ubuntu_> yeah then what
[11:05] <vars_> and how do i make a static ip addres in linux
[11:05] <ubuntu_> it doesnt say anything about load into memory
[11:05] <erik_m> but in trail - /var/log/messages i cant see the returning data
[11:05] <salkot> erik_m, are you sure that you aren't just seeing the data coming in? you might need to turn on forwarding
[11:05] <salkot> with sysctl
[11:06] <dave__> sorry havent got that paticular cd but ?
[11:06] <ubuntu_> sysctl ?
[11:06] <animato> j #xubuntu
[11:06] <erik_m> i added forwarding to sysctl.conf
[11:06] <dave__> it works on slax live cd
[11:07] <ubuntu_> Does anyone know how to boot ubuntu live cd into memory ?
[11:07] <OlliK> can any .bin be converted to .deb?
[11:07] <salkot> erik_m, if it were me, I'd use tcpdump to see exactly what's happening. if forwarding is on, and your computer is doing nat, that's all that should be necessary
[11:08] <ubuntu_> DOES ANYBODY KNOW ?!
[11:08] <erik_m> alkot lol i never actualy thought about tcpdump lol , cheers ill see whats happening :)
[11:09] <animato> does xubuntu have an automatic update manager like gnome does?
[11:09] <ubuntu_> anybody know how to load ubuntu live cd into memory
[11:09] <erik_m> done all this caper before but with the output being an amateur radio packet radio network  lol

[11:31] <SeLaB> !suse
[11:31] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, SeLaB

[11:32] <brn> QIIESTION:  How to install an RPM package under Ubuntu.  Anyone?...
[11:32] <aftertaf> rencrash, hehe its true. thereare loads :)
[11:32] <Aap> somebody can help me?
[11:32] <aftertaf> brn, better not to. IMHO. why you trying? better to build from source if no debs available
[11:33] <rencrash> aftertaf,  i know just wondering if you would recomend one... for ubuntu
[11:33] <aftertaf> ive never done it, so i guess im just taking up irc realestate for nothing ;)
[11:33] <apokryphos> brn: /msg ubotu rpm
[11:33] <apokryphos> brn: though, what are you trying to install with rpm?
[11:34] <mimihu88> #ubuntu
[11:34] <samuel_> is Suse taking over ubuntu on distrowatch?
[11:34] <samuel_> why
[11:34] <apokryphos> samuel_: it's gaining on it quite quickly, I think, yes :)
[11:34] <brn> aftertaf:  Thanks.  I just downloaded (hopefully) a driver for a brand-new Epson printer.  The only option was RPM.
[11:34] <apokryphos> suse 10.1 was recently released
[11:34] <blue-frog> rencrash http://www.howtoforge.com/taxonomy_menu/1/4
[11:34] <samuel_> why?
[11:34] <samuel_> oh
[11:35] <apokryphos> samuel_: why was 10.1 released?
[11:35] <aftertaf> brn, no source? argh.
[11:35] <samuel_> what is the best distro
[11:35] <samuel_> no
[11:35] <rencrash> thanks blue-frog
[11:35] <apokryphos> samuel_: there is no "best distro"
[11:35] <blue-frog> samuel_ the one you like
[11:35] <apokryphos> there are different distributions for different needs and trends
[11:35] <samuel_> I like ubuntu
[11:35] <apokryphos> good
[11:35] <samuel_> i just wish it had kde intergrated into it
[11:35] <blue-frog> samuel_ then it is the best for you..
[11:35] <blue-frog> samuel_ use kubuntu then
[11:35] <apokryphos> samuel_: install kubuntu-desktop
[11:36] <Aap> hi, i have a problem: since yesterday i don't have any sound anymore. lspci shows my sound card
[11:36] <apokryphos> Aap: do you use breezy?
[11:36] <Aap> yeah
[11:36] <miranda82> i got a problem, my session restarts when it s just loaded, i tried to drag and drop a png file to the panel, (to make a shortcut) and i think is that...
[11:36] <Aap> i think so yes
[11:36] <aftertaf> Aap, install aumix and check your mixer is not set to 0% volume. happened to me yesterday too
[11:36] <apokryphos> Aap: what does cat /etc/issue say?
[11:37] <apokryphos> aftertaf: no need to install, just run alsamixer in terminal
[11:37] <Aap> breezy
[11:37] <aftertaf> aha :)
[11:37] <brn> aftertaf:  Source?  I have never in my tiny life as a ?-nix user been able to compile anything.  Give me an easier way out.
[11:37] <tga> howdy
[11:37] <apokryphos> Aap: ok, first check your sound settings and make sure nothing's on mute. type alsamixer in terminal
[11:37] <Aap> i did that
[11:37] <apokryphos> or go to gnome-volume-settings (or whatever it is you guys have :P)
[11:37] <Aap> nothing on mute
[11:37] <tga> I have a big usability problem regarding network configuration.. how can I get a list of available wifi hotspots and choose the one I want to connect to?
[11:37] <apokryphos> Aap: try aplay some.wav; output?
[11:37] <Aap> ?
[11:38] <Aap> apokryphos: i don't understand
=== GTroy is now known as GTroy_
[11:38] <apokryphos> Aap: in a terminal: aplay some.wav
[11:38] <apokryphos> any wav file; gnome should have plenty
[11:39] <Aap> aplay says he's playing it
[11:39] <francesco_> ciao

[11:40] <Aap> anyone another suggestion?
[11:41] <francesco_> ho probblemi con la web cam ... chi mi aiuta?
[11:41] <samuel_> Is linux just for ugly people?
[11:41] <samuel_> or good looking men like myself too.

[11:59] <spikeb> brn: breezy is the current release, and dapper is the next release, on june 1

[12:00] <brn> ...opps... My mistake.  I was thinking of "Dapper Drake".  Whien anyway?
[12:00] <spikeb> why doesn't the bot do it?
[12:01] <apokryphos> brn: june 1st, as ubotu said
[12:02] <brn> all:  I have both the RPM and source (or so I think) for the Epson C88 printer.  Now if only I can get #*!$  gcc to work...
[12:03] <ompaul> spikeb, it can't handle the character set
[12:03] <spikeb> ompaul: ahh ok
[12:03] <moonysuny> so many people are here ,i come here the first time, glad to meet you
[12:03] <johannes_erik> brn was there not a .deb package on that site ?
[12:03] <ompaul> brn System Administration Printing
[12:03] <rencrash> what could be the problem with the sending of my email? the smtp server name is right but it gives me this error = Error while performing operation.
[12:03] <rencrash> RCPT TO <name@webmail.co.za> failed: Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable
[12:04] <johannes_erik> ompaul hes wanting the drivers extra properties etc with epson drivers
[12:04] <ompaul> ahhh
[12:05] <johannes_erik> lol ive been sitting here waiting for a network expert to hop along , thought id help ppl out in the mean time lol
[12:06] <haffe> Hello. Does anyone here have any experience using LyX/LaTex? What's the code for the conjugation symbol?
[12:06] <aftertaf> lol johannes_erik
[12:06] <brn> ompaul:  Tried.  I have a "working" printer but there are features available for Windows that I miss with Linux.  I would be more comfortable with a printer that I could address directly (in manchine language, which I am comfortable with) but it gets tougher as the years go by.
[12:07] <johannes_erik> brn did u install CUPS ?
[12:07] <ubuntu_> !mp3
[12:07] <ubotu> mp3 is, like, totally, a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[12:07] <queuetue> Hi.  Does anyone have a writeup to publish netatalk and ssh via avahi?
[12:07] <ompaul> johannes_erik, its there by default you just don't interface with it the same way
[12:08] <ompaul> johannes_erik, have you set up routes for the traffic to find the outside world
[12:08] <rencrash> how do i give apt-get root rights ?
[12:08] <ompaul> rencrash, again I say :-)  rencrash, sudo apt-get install PACKAGE
[12:08] <vmadmin> hello
[12:09] <johannes_erik> ompaul : hi , i have and still no go
[12:09] <vmadmin> ompaul: can I pick your brain for a sec please
[12:09] <ompaul> rencrash, did you understand that? >>>> sudo apt-get install Package<<
[12:09] <rencrash> yes thanks you ompaul
[12:09] <ompaul> vmadmin, you know the gig ask the channel if I know I pitch in
[12:10] <vmadmin> ompaul; ok will do
[12:10] <ompaul> johannes_erik, and the gateway is known to the down stream machines
[12:10] <brn> johannes:  As far as I know I do have CUPS.  I found (thanks to another respondent here) a site in Japan that seems to offer the exact driver for my exact model of Epson printer.  I have downloaded both the RPM and "source" (I think) and haven't tried either yet.  "News at eleven" as they say on TV.
[12:11] <ompaul> brn, thats what you say when it works :-)
[12:11] <johannes_erik> i was the other respondant , im using a diffrent machine now (nbetwork probs)
[12:11] <johannes_erik> but yeah discard the rpm
[12:11] <johannes_erik> your gonna have to go by the source
[12:12] <ompaul> brn, rpm is not your friend, it is not apt to be friendly to your machine
[12:12] <brn> ompau:  You got it there my friend.  I wish I knew what I was doing but I don't.  But yet I stick to Linux and Ubuntu.  Go figure.
[12:12] <rencrash> ompaul thanks again got it up
[12:12] <johannes_erik> jus so ompaul can follow if wants to lol , the drivers r filters and descrips to go with CUPS for epson printers
[12:12] <ompaul> rencrash, there is a "driver Section" in that applicaiton I pointed to
[12:13] <vmadmin> in the url here i have been asked to make a partitions for boot and swap and addidional partiions for he future, its it ok form this point of view just to make a boot and swap partition now ans resize later? here is the url http://doc.gwos.org/index.php?title=Encrypted_Filesystem&redirect=no
[12:13] <ubuntu_> !usb
[12:13] <ubotu> parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu_
[12:14] <johannes_erik> brn jus checking the source see if i can help ya compile it
[12:15] <ompaul> vmadmin, why on earth do you want an encrypted filesystem, and there is something on the Ubuntu Wiki about that afik https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EncryptedFilesystemHowto?highlight=%28encrypted%29%7C%28filesystem%29
[12:15] <ompaul> vmadmin, and set all your partitions up first
[12:16] <vmadmin> ompaul: i asked a questions its ubuntu related and now you are asking me whay on earth? its not fair its seems I canoot do anything correct
[12:16] <brn> johannes:  THanks!  I have never had luck with gcc.  Getting old, I admit that I would rather just grab a binary.
[12:17] <killercacti> how might I search through the list of packages via cli? grep some list that is downloaded with apt-get I'm guessing?
[12:17] <phenom> Can I ask an experinced C++ programmer a question in IM? (Deald with 11 lines of code)
[12:17] <ompaul> vmadmin, okay, I gave you the faq on it, the only time you want an encrypted filesystem is if you have peoples creditcard details on it, wages or state secrets cos you will have a lot of problems trying to recover if anything goes wrong
[12:17] <johannes_erik> brn yeah but its always good to go from source ! harder but better! :)
[12:18] <DBO> not to mention the CPU and speed overhead involved with encryped filesystems
[12:18] <vmadmin> ompaul: its wages and salary items
[12:18] <ubuntu_> um
[12:18] <ubuntu_> how can i use photoshop on ubuntu ?
[12:19] <DBO> ubuntu_, use GIMP...
[12:19] <ubuntu_> but GIMP isnt as good as photoshop
[12:19] <brn> johannes:  I agree but fact is as I get older, patience and memory both fade.  Trust this:  I would rather die with Linux than live with Windows.  But that is just me talking to myself.
[12:19] <Ng> killercacti: apt-cache
[12:19] <DBO> ubuntu_, blashpemy, of course it is!  anyhow, photoshop doesnt work with linux...
[12:19] <killercacti> Ng: I'll check it out, thanks
[12:19] <tbf> how can i capture kernel log messages if the notebook freezes on startup but doesn't have a serial port?
[12:20] <ubuntu_> ah crap
[12:20] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, apparently older versions of PS (PS 7, I think) run in Wine... but have a go with the gimp, it's better than you might htink
[12:20] <ompaul> ubuntu_, okay so maybe wine / crossover office might help but that is all
[12:20] <johannes_erik> brn u do ./configure
[12:20] <johannes_erik> ?
[12:20] <Ng> tbf: you pretty much can't, unless they show up on screen and you can take a picture :/
[12:20] <Madpilot> think, even...
[12:20] <ubuntu_> I LOVE PS7
[12:20] <ubuntu_> only one I use !
[12:20] <ompaul> ubuntu_, less language thanks
[12:20] <Ng> ubuntu_: Codeweavers Crossover can run some versions of Photosop, but you have to buy it
[12:20] <tbf> Ng: damn, i knew linux suxors! ;-D
[12:20] <ubuntu_> ok whats wine and where do i get it
[12:20] <ubuntu_> no man
[12:20] <ubuntu_> this is my first day on linux
[12:20] <DBO> ubuntu_, really, unless you are a REALLY professional photoshopper, gimp can handle you.  GIMP even supports photoshop plugins =)
[12:21] <Ng> tbf: it has nothing to do with linux, laptop manufacturers suck for taking serial ports away :/
[12:21] <ubuntu_> i just got mp3 working feeeeels good
[12:21] <DBO> !wine
[12:21] <ubuntu_> yes im a pro
[12:21] <T`> oh boy!! finally found the problemw hy i can't hibernate
[12:21] <ubuntu_> !wine
[12:21] <vmadmin> ompaul: at leat I have not mentioned the D word?
[12:21] <DBO> !tell ubuntu_ about wine
[12:21] <T`> i changed my partition and the initrd image still has resume=/dev/hda5
[12:21] <Mukunda> Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
[12:21] <T`> instead of hda6
[12:21] <T`> !!!
[12:21] <ubotu> T`: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[12:21] <ubuntu_> I need dreamweaver 8 and notepad ++
[12:21] <Mukunda> I did hope it'd just work out of the box, but noooo.
[12:21] <T`> how do i update the initrd image? (i just pass in the args thru menu.lst now )
[12:21] <T`> anyone know?
[12:21] <ompaul> vmadmin, you have me lost, but lets not go there
[12:22] <ubuntu_> did someone just say buy ?
[12:22] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, instead of dw, try Nvu - it's in Ubuntu's repositories.
[12:22] <ompaul> ubuntu_, no you don't
[12:22] <vmadmin> tompaul: thanks for the FAQ
[12:22] <ompaul> vmadmin, :)
[12:22] <johannes_erik> brn in the dir you extracted the src for the printer file
[12:22] <johannes_erik> ./configure
[12:22] <johannes_erik> make install
[12:22] <tbf> Ng: why should they built in legacy serial ports if their only use is capturing linux kernel logs, but the notebook features zillions of other ports?
[12:22] <ubuntu_> nvu thankyou
[12:22] <I_Love_DRM> direct ex
[12:23] <ubuntu_> whats it under ?
[12:23] <ompaul> ubuntu_, click on System Administration Synaptic to install software
[12:23] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, Applications->Add Applications, just search for nvu
[12:24] <Ng> tbf: some of us need/use serial ports all the time to talk to other hardware :)
[12:24] <ubuntu_> ok thanks
[12:24] <ompaul> Madpilot, one of these days I will remember that one, /me sulks and goes back to his command line ;-)
[12:24] <Ng> tbf: as long as new hardware products are released with serial interfaces, I would not describe a serial port as "legacy", but this is getting a bit off-topic for here
[12:24] <ubuntu_> cause i would switch to linux if I can have dreamweaver 8, PS7 and mozilla lol
[12:24] <Mukunda> Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
[12:24] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, by 'mozilla', do you mean the browser (Firefox is already installed) or what?
[12:25] <johannes_erik> ull get mozilla ubuntu_ :)
[12:25] <spikeb> ubuntu_: you'll have mozilla :)
[12:25] <brn> Johannes:  Got that so far.   tar,  etc.  No probem there.  But every *nix source file I have tried to compile has crashed.  You gotta know that I am an old "hardware skunk" who programs computers only when absolutely necessary.
[12:25] <ubuntu_> yeah i have mozilla im happy with that
[12:25] <ubuntu_> I also need flash 8
[12:25] <ubuntu_> and i heard flash player 8 is not supported by linux yet !
[12:25] <spikeb> i belive there's a beta of flash 8.5
[12:26] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, Macromedia hasn't bothered with Flash 8 for linux yet... we're still stuck w/ 7
[12:26] <ubuntu_> downloading nvu
[12:26] <ubuntu_> ah crap um
[12:26] <ubuntu_> cause im a big web developer
[12:26] <ubuntu_> I need the baseline of multimedia
[12:27] <ubuntu_> god i love linux so far
[12:27] <ubuntu_> so many programs :D
[12:27] <ubuntu_> and its preety fast of the cd !
[12:27] <Ng> !enter
[12:27] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[12:27] <I_Love_DRM> im loving it too ubuntu_
[12:27] <spikeb> there is a beta of flash 8.5 for linux, ubuntu_
[12:27] <assclown> im about to strangle kubuntu
[12:27] <ubuntu_> can you link me please
[12:27] <spikeb> ubuntu_: sure let me find something
[12:27] <ubuntu_> !flash 8
[12:27] <ubotu> ubuntu_: parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[12:27] <ubuntu_> damn lol
[12:28] <I_Love_DRM> Its about time I removed the multiboot part - if only I could get this vpn to work
[12:28] <MistaED> spikeb: there's a flash 8.5 beta? where?
[12:28] <spikeb> i am looking
[12:28] <Madpilot> assclown, want to get a nicer nick, please?
[12:28] <spikeb> they might have closed the public beta, but i didnt hear of that
[12:28] <assclown> are you serious ?
[12:28] <Madpilot> assclown, entirely
[12:29] <assclown> ...
[12:29] <tbf> Ng: yup, it's off-topic as this doesn't help me on solving those ACPI vs. SATA or whatver issues
=== assclown is now known as asshat
[12:29] <I_Love_DRM> :/
=== asshat is now known as asshat_
[12:29] <spikeb> MistaED and ubuntu_ : seems the public beta isn't available anymore. sorry
[12:29] <vmadmin> ompaul; very iitresting article i will print it out it isolder the url i gave you but the baiscs are the same ,  many thanks apologies for my silly outbust before
[12:29] <ubuntu_> Im using a live-cd and im installing all this stuff
[12:30] <vmadmin> interesting
[12:30] <johannes_erik> brn sry was away from computer for a sec
[12:30] <ubuntu_> !wine
[12:30] <MistaED> spikeb: to the bittorrent!
[12:30] <Madpilot> asshat_, still not funny. Last warning...
[12:30] <johannes_erik> ok in terminal
=== asshat_ is now known as Jel
=== Jel is now known as Jel_
[12:31] <johannes_erik> brn cd to the directory , #./configure     #make    #make install
[12:31] <Jel_> is this OK ?
[12:31] <ubuntu_> alright i could get used to ubuntu :D
[12:32] <tribe> hi there
[12:32] <donald> hi
[12:32] <tribe> anyone got dapper updated?
[12:32] <Madpilot> Jel_, much better
[12:32] <johannes_erik> brn post back any errors you get on the way :)
[12:32] <pvd2006> when I goto update manager and it loads a new list are these actually going to be installed? Because I have random stuff like stuff for kde but Im running xfce and never installed kde on this system. random stuff like cd browing plugin for konqerer and such.
[12:32] <ubuntu_> ok guys im downloading wine and its a .deb file
[12:32] <ubuntu_> !.deb
[12:32] <ubotu> Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu_
[12:33] <vmadmin> ompaul: yiu said set up all your partitions first -that means no resizeing in this howto you actaully  install the full syatem later
[12:33] <tribe> cuz i got a segfault on pdfnup program (pdfjam package) even after reinstall it, if anyone can try a simple $ pdfnup file.pdf and tell me if segfaults...
[12:33] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, wine is in repos - switch to Synaptic and get it from there
[12:33] <Jel_> for the love of god i cannot figure out why grub refuses to install...
[12:33] <ubuntu_> ok thanks man
[12:33] <Jel_> im about to strange this thing...
[12:33] <brn> johannes:  I have untarred the file in my ~/download directory. are you sure about the syntax #./configure etc?  I will try it
[12:33] <ubuntu_> how can you change the ubunto skin ?
[12:33] <ubuntu_> its to bright its burning my eyes
[12:34] <johannes_erik> i put the # to show that thats the start of a command to type
[12:34] <johannes_erik> dont actualy put the #
[12:34] <pvd2006> ubuntu_ just wondering also what your screen refresh rate is at right now?
[12:34] <johannes_erik> :)
[12:34] <ubuntu_> 60
[12:34] <ubuntu_> im feeling dizzy
[12:34] <pvd2006> That isnt too good for your eyes:-\
[12:34] <ubuntu_> im so used to windows
[12:34] <Ng> ubuntu_: system->preferences->theme
[12:34] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, System->Prefs->Theme
[12:35] <ubuntu_> what refresh rate do i put it at
[12:35] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell ubuntu_ about fixres
[12:35] <ompaul> ompaul Madpilot, this just arrived in my mail  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases  <-- we soo needed this would !feature be a good name for it?
[12:35] <ompaul> ubuntu_, a little change goes a huge way
[12:35] <pvd2006> anything above 60hz;)
[12:35] <ubuntu_> its 60
[12:35] <pvd2006> hmm
[12:35] <ompaul> ubuntu_, if you are on a live CD really you should wait until you install
[12:35] <Madpilot> ompaul, how about !timetable
[12:35] <ubuntu_> how much space is needed for ubuntu ?
[12:35] <ubuntu_> im trying to resize
[12:35] <pvd2006> ohh, your on live cd alright
[12:36] <I_Love_DRM> im at 60hz too but lcds are different
[12:36] <apokryphos> ubuntu_: default install is about 1.8 gigs
[12:36] <ubuntu_> ok thanks
[12:36] <Kamping_Kaiser> ubotu, you want *more* tehn 2 gig
[12:36] <ubotu> Kamping_Kaiser: Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[12:36] <apokryphos> ubuntu_: I recommend putting at least 5/6 gigs for / partition
[12:36] <Kamping_Kaiser> preferably 3
[12:36] <apokryphos> if not more
[12:36] <ubuntu_> um ok
[12:36] <pvd2006> ubuntu_ you migh want to make the partition 5-10gigs depending on wether or not you download big files a lot.
[12:36] <I_Love_DRM> ubuntu_, dont use anything less then 6 - I learnt the hard way
[12:36] <moonysuny> how to install a live-cd?
[12:36] <ompaul> Madpilot, that also reason is this, people come in and say "Foo Version New" is out why is that not in Breezy / Dapper etc
[12:36] <ubuntu_> ok ive given it 8GB
[12:36] <Madpilot> ompaul, yeah, I know
[12:37] <ubuntu_> what file system does linux need ?
[12:37] <pvd2006> ext3 is a good choice
[12:37] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, ext3 is the default
[12:37] <ubuntu_> ok
[12:37] <ubuntu_> is it a primary partition ?
[12:37] <brn> johannes:  I tried #./ configure.  Didn't work.  Then I tried ./cofigure and it reported "cannot configure executeables".  Bummer!
[12:37] <Madpilot> the installer can do reformatting/partitioning for you
[12:37] <pvd2006> ubuntu yeah
[12:37] <ubuntu_> because i want to run windows and and linux
[12:37] <Ng> brn: have you installed the build-essential package?
[12:37] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell ubuntu_ about dualboot
[12:37] <ubuntu_> and how do i choose which operating system i want to  use at start up
[12:38] <ubuntu_> ah thanks :D
[12:38] <pinky> How shuld I go about reformating this external hard drive so it has ext3 instead of NTFS?
[12:38] <johannes_erik> brn ok :) read back i said that # was a new line indicator , its ok tho :)
[12:38] <johannes_erik> but that is a bummer
[12:38] <brn> ??? "build-essential package?
[12:38] <I_Love_DRM> I just did what your wanting to do ubuntu_ - multiboot after reducing a ntfs partition without losing data
[12:38] <johannes_erik> i was going by the fact the was a configure file
[12:38] <ubuntu_> ok
[12:38] <pvd2006> Ubuntu_ if you have windows xp partition that already takes up the full drive then you will have to resize it then create a new primary partition for a ext3 linux partition I think.
[12:38] <ubuntu_> ive made a new partition
[12:38] <Madpilot> ubotu, timetable is <reply>Ubuntu uses a strict timetable for releases, which means that sometimes new releases miss the timetable. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases for more.
[12:39] <ubotu> okay, Madpilot
[12:39] <ubuntu_> yeah
[12:39] <ubuntu_> i have a 30GB partition for windows and 8GB for linux
[12:39] <pvd2006> cool cool
[12:39] <I_Love_DRM> What did you use to make the new partition ???
[12:39] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell ompaul about timetable
[12:39] <pvd2006> looks like your set
[12:39] <ubuntu_> and windows is ntfs and linux is ext3
[12:39] <SaLoMoN> uh
[12:39] <SaLoMoN> ntfs :|
[12:39] <ubuntu_> is that bad ?
[12:39] <apokryphos> ubuntu_: gnu/linux *can* be ext3; reiser is also a popular filesystem format
[12:39] <I_Love_DRM> mines the same 30/8
[12:40] <ompaul> Madpilot,  I was almost finished :-) okay leave it as one only
[12:40] <ubuntu_> hahaha
[12:40] <pvd2006> ubuntu_ you wont be able to write to your ntfs hard drive from linux
[12:40] <pvd2006> with ntfs
[12:40] <johannes_erik> brn ./configure in the directory works here :-o , u sure ur in the pips... dir ?
[12:40] <ubuntu_> there is only 8mb space left on my windows partion
[12:40] <pvd2006> but that is what I have right now
[12:40] <pvd2006> oh lol
[12:40] <I_Love_DRM> What did you use to repartition ubuntu_
[12:40] <ubuntu_> gparted
[12:40] <Madpilot> ompaul, I just edited !timetable slightly
[12:40] <pvd2006> 8megabytes?
[12:40] <pvd2006> wow
[12:41] <pinky> How should I go about reformating this external hard drive so it has ext3 instead of NTFS?
[12:41] <ubuntu_> i rezised my windows partion to 30GB from 38GB and made the new partion ext 3
[12:41] <pinky> What utilites are available to wipe NTFS partitions on USB drives?
[12:41] <pvd2006> oh so its about 38gig hard drive than
[12:41] <ompaul> Madkiss, :-) good stuff
[12:41] <ubuntu_> yah
[12:41] <apokryphos> pinky: mkfs.ext3 /dev/location
[12:41] <ompaul> Madpilot, :-) good stuff (tab errors)
[12:41] <ubuntu_> 40GB..but yeah 38
[12:42] <ubuntu_> when i get on windows i need to uninstall some crap !
[12:42] <brn> johannes:  (and thank you for your patience) the tar.gz file is in ~/download and the unzipped source is in a subdirectory.  This is where I am at right now.
[12:42] <ompaul> ubuntu_, less langauge please
[12:42] <Mukunda> Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
[12:42] <apokryphos> ubuntu_: all of windows, that is.
[12:42] <ubuntu_> oh sorry
[12:42] <ubuntu_> haha :P
[12:42] <pvd2006> Hmm, Ubuntu_ did you create a swap partition?
[12:42] <ubuntu_> no
[12:42] <ubuntu_> whats a swap partion ?
[12:42] <pinky> apokryphos: can I say /dev/sdc to do the whole drive as one partition instead of /dev/sdc1?
[12:43] <johannes_erik> brn ok :) dont worry u will get it installed: ) , ok so in the subdir in a terminal ?
[12:43] <pinky> apokryphos: I currently have a /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdc2 both of which are NTFS, and both of which I'd like erased.
[12:43] <apokryphos> pinky: hm, I'm not sure. Could go the graphical way to be sure; gparted.
[12:43] <pvd2006> its like virtual memory if you fill up your real memory.
[12:43] <pinky> I only need a /dev/sdc1
[12:43] <ubuntu_> ah ok
[12:43] <ubuntu_> um
[12:43] <ubuntu_> how much for swap then ?
[12:43] <I_Love_DRM> Best thing for new users like me is to leave the free space as it is and let ubuntu setup partition it for you
[12:43] <pvd2006> maybe 512- a gig?
[12:43] <ubuntu_> ok 1GB it is.
[12:43] <ubuntu_> im on a laptop by the way
[12:44] <I_Love_DRM> same lol
[12:44] <ubuntu_> this doesnt interfere with anything does it ?
[12:44] <brn> Johannes:  No terminal.  This is a solo compter, albeit somewhat ancient.
[12:44] <I_Love_DRM> What type of laptop ubuntu_
[12:44] <Madkiss> ompaul: wassabi?
[12:44] <apokryphos> I_Love_DRM: it will automatically shrink the partition?
[12:44] <pvd2006> I couldnt answer that question, :-\
[12:44] <apokryphos> don't recall seeing that option on ubuntu
[12:44] <johannes_erik> brn ok just so i understand , ur using gnome gui ?
[12:44] <ubuntu_> ok guys
[12:44] <ubuntu_> is the file system linux_swap ?
[12:44] <johannes_erik> brn im a bit slow sometimes lol
[12:45] <pvd2006> ubuntu_ yeah fo the swap partition
[12:45] <brn> Johannes:  Yes.  Gnome and Ubuntu 5.10.
[12:45] <ubuntu_> thanks
[12:45] <I_Love_DRM> I just shrunk the ntfs partition with symantec partition magic then ket the Ubuntu setup worry about swap/ext3
[12:45] <ubuntu_> ok
[12:45] <ubuntu_> its applying the changes !
[12:45] <ubuntu_> I got an error !
[12:45] <ompaul> Madpilot, your edit is good, and I got caught with a tab the line preceeding
[12:45] <ubuntu_> but i cant see anything !
[12:45] <brn> ...I think I have all the supported packages loaded.
[12:46] <richiefrich> I_Love_DRM, LOL i like the name but not drm
[12:46] <pvd2006> ubuntu_ do you have enough room to create a swap of one gig right now btw?
[12:46] <johannes_erik> ok brn go to apps top left accessory > terminal
[12:46] <ubuntu_> damn
[12:46] <ubuntu_> um
[12:47] <ubuntu_> i didnt have enough space
[12:47] <ubuntu_> oops
[12:47] <ompaul> !enter
[12:47] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[12:47] <pvd2006> haha, thats ok, you can resize the ubuntu partition to 7gigs
[12:47] <pvd2006> linux partition I mean, whatever you want to call it
[12:48] <Sandy16> how to enable root to login through GUI
[12:48] <ubuntu_> ok im being more generous with space
[12:48] <pvd2006> ;)
[12:48] <Madpilot> Sandy16, that's really not recommended - or needed...
[12:48] <Mukunda> Ubuntu is a piece of crap, I've been trying for hours to get these dance pads to work, which should just work as usb joysticks, but there are no joystick devices or anything in /dev or /dev/input
[12:48] <johannes_erik> sudo should be enough!
[12:48] <brn> Johannes:  Keep going.  Now I have two terminal windows on the screen.  Is this right?  (You think you're slow?  Try me.)
[12:48] <ompaul> !tell Sandy16 about root
[12:48] <ubuntu_> damn it
[12:49] <ompaul> Sandy16, please read the message from the bot, the url is really what I want you to read
[12:49] <ubuntu_> it keeps failing with the swap !
[12:49] <Tedd> Mukunda: There are quite a few people who would disagree with you. :)
[12:49] <johannes_erik> brn :-) ok now cd right into the dir where files are extracted
[12:49] <liquidindian> Hello.  Does anyone have any tips for performance?  I get a lot of skipped frames when I'm playing video.  It seemed to work slightly better under XP - any advice to maybe stop processes that are running by default and not needed?
[12:49] <I_Love_DRM> ubuntu_, is there anything on the ext3 you made?
[12:49] <ompaul> ubuntu_, you are installing on another machine?
[12:49] <ubuntu_> nope
[12:49] <Mukunda> Tedd: they can disagree all they want, but it won't make the usb joystick devices work.
[12:49] <ubuntu_> there is a previous ext3 with a massive 8MB size :D :P
[12:49] <mewino> ohhhhh
[12:50] <mewino> mola
[12:50] <ubuntu_> ok im going to do one thing at a time
[12:50] <Tedd> Mukunda: This is true. The simple answer would be...if you don't like it, don't use it, don't complain
[12:50] <johannes_erik> brn now #dir   (ignore my # they show a new line, dont actualy type # :)  )
[12:50] <brn> Johannes:  Now I am in the directory wiith hte unzipped printer driver stuff.  Now what?
[12:50] <ubuntu_> guys its not working
[12:50] <ompaul> Mukunda, please reboot when usb fails it helps more times than it does not - devfs is dead and udev can and should work with little effort
[12:50] <ubuntu_> i press apply
[12:50] <ubuntu_> and it does stuff
[12:51] <johannes_erik> brn as u probably know that list all the files , just check to confirm a file called configure is there
[12:51] <ubuntu_> then it refreshes and its back to normal
[12:51] <ompaul> ubuntu_, are you installing from a live CD?
[12:51] <johannes_erik> brn now #./configure
[12:51] <ubuntu_> im not installing
[12:51] <ubuntu_> im changin the partitions from a live cd
[12:51] <ubuntu_> using gparted
[12:51] <usuario> www. chat . com
[12:52] <brn> johannes:  Got it.  Configure appears to be executeable if I understand the color-coding.
[12:52] <ubuntu_> hey also, i have the the dapper drake flight 7 disc
[12:52] <Mukunda> ompaul: done that.
[12:52] <ubuntu_> should I install that ?
[12:52] <johannes_erik> brn it may fail yet any errors ?
[12:53] <ubuntu_> ?
[12:53] <pinky> Is ext3 preferable over ext2 on external hard drives as well?
[12:53] <Madpilot> ubuntu_, if you do a Breezy install, you'll be able to update/upgrade that to Dapper when you want to
[12:54] <ompaul> Mukunda, have a poke around here, I don't have one so  am not familar with their workings: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=joystick&fullsearch=Text
[12:54] <pvd2006> Ubuntu_ what type of internet connection do you have ?
[12:54] <johannes_erik> brn will be back in a second
[12:54] <Mukunda> ompaul: I've tried, I'll check that though.
[12:54] <OlliK> how can I add new user to the linux?
[12:54] <ubuntu_> 22MBIT
[12:54] <pinky> OlliL: adduser foo
[12:54] <pvd2006> olliK adduser
[12:54] <OlliK> When i try to add user like: sudo adduser name group, it says "The user 'name' does not exist.
=== ubuntu_ is now known as Corey
[12:55] <OlliK> How could it exist becuase I'm just trying to create it? I don't get it
[12:55] <pvd2006> did you say 22mbit?
[12:55] <Corey> yes
[12:55] <Corey> :D
[12:55] <mihai> I have one question. If I upgrade to Dapper using gksudo ... will Avidemux, Azureus, etc still work? I've installed those using Automatix
[12:56] <Corey> 22,000kbs
[12:56] <OlliK> Does anyone know how to add a user to linux using adduser-command? I've looked from man adduser and it seems to be just like: "sudo adduser thename thegroup"
[12:56] <Corey> I download at like 2500 kb a second ^_^
[12:56] <pvd2006> Corey, wow.
[12:56] <OlliK> But for me, it says "adduser: The user 'theuser' does not exist."
[12:56] <pvd2006> I wish I had that type of connection.
[12:56] <Corey> its hell cheap
[12:56] <kesV> pinky: yes. I'd say so, since it's entirely possible a read is interrupted on an external drive.
[12:56] <Corey> if you in australia !
[12:56] <Corey> $80 including line rental for telephone !
[12:56] <johannes_erik> brn back , u get anywhere with the ./configure  ?
[12:57] <brn> Johannes:  It reports:  "Checking for C compiler default output... configure: error:  C compiler cannot create executeables"
[12:57] <Corey> so reaaly..its $45 for adsl++2
[12:57] <pvd2006> Corey, that is not bad at all.
[12:57] <kesV> pinky: obviously I meant a write, but you get the idea
[12:57] <pvd2006> Corey, I would would install breezy then update to dapper when you need to or want to.
[12:57] <shadow`> http://sourceforge.net/projects/bloodymary
[12:58] <shadow`> now THAT'S useful
[12:58] <I_Love_DRM> Ill be getting 22mb when I move to brisbane next month.
[12:58] <johannes_erik> brn hmmmmm should be a.out
[12:58] <OlliK> Can anyone help me with "adduser" command?
[12:58] <Corey> well im still new
[12:58] <Corey> so ill just go with breezy badger :d
[12:58] <Corey> :D
[12:58] <spikeb> Corey: great idea
[12:58] <pvd2006> ahhhhh, I am still waiting for FTTP to come to my area so I can get 15Mbit/s
[12:59] <mihai> I have one question. If I upgrade to Dapper using gksudo ... will Avidemux, Azureus, etc still work? I've installed those using Automatix
[12:59] <johannes_erik> brn #sudo apt-get install gcc
[12:59] <mihai> connection problem
[12:59] <johannes_erik> brn to make sure ur gcc is latest
[01:00] <Corey> ok im happy with ubuntu
[01:00] <pvd2006> OlliK: try this
[01:00] <I_Love_DRM> This is the only linux distro that hasn't been fdisk /mbr'd after a week
[01:00] <Corey> so has anybody been able to run photoshop 7 with wine ?
[01:00] <pvd2006> sudo -s then after that just type adduser name group etc...
[01:00] <Samuli^> Corey, Don't ask for too much dude :)
[01:00] <brn> Johannes:  I could compile C source on this computer a long(?) time ago when I had RedHat v.6, but not siince then.
[01:00] <spikeb> Corey: in theory it works
[01:00] <pinky> Corey: Try The GIMP?
[01:00] <Corey> I didnt like the gump
[01:01] <Corey> gimp**
[01:01] <Samuli^> GIMP r0x0r.
[01:01] <Samuli^> And it's free.
[01:01] <spikeb> bah
[01:01] <Corey> haha
[01:01] <spikeb> get used to it, gimp rules
[01:01] <pinky> Corey: Why's that?
[01:01] <blue-frog> corey photoshop works fine with windows...
[01:01] <Corey> Yes I know that but i want to use linux
[01:01] <Ng> Corey: Codeweavers Crossover runs some versions of photoshop if you don't mind paying, but it ought to work ok in recent WINEs I would think
[01:01] <johannes_erik> brn i know the feeling used to run slackware loved that ditro but so akward, but anyway lol u try the spt-get thing ?
[01:01] <Ng> codeweavers seem to feed their changes back in
[01:01] <johannes_erik> *apt-get
[01:02] <pinky> Corey: Have you tried Gimpshop?
[01:02] <Corey> yeah, so wine makes .exe work does it ?
[01:02] <Corey> gimpshop ?
[01:02] <Ng> Corey: some exe's, yeah
[01:02] <brn> Johannes:  I appear to have gcc v 4.0.2 here.
[01:02] <Corey> I used gimp image editor and didnt like it
[01:02] <Mukunda> Well until dapper can take a usb joystick and go out of the box, it's crap.
[01:02] <pinky> Corey: That's why I asked *why* you prefer Photoshop... Gimpshop is made specifically to look and act like Photoshop's interface.
[01:02] <Samuli^> Corey, you don't like it because you're not used to it.
[01:02] <spikeb> gimpshop makes gimp more like photoshop
[01:02] <pinky> It's probably because you are unfamiliar with the GIMP
[01:03] <nixuser> like everyone needs a usb joystick
[01:03] <spikeb> anyone who isn't familiar with gimp probably hates it, PS user or not
[01:03] <Corey> yeah does gimp have ps power ?
[01:03] <spikeb> it's a rather horribly designed interface
[01:03] <pinky> If you could specify beyond "why you don't like it" it would be helpful.
[01:03] <Corey> cause photoshop is a very could package
[01:03] <Corey> good*
[01:03] <pvd2006> whats the command to remove a user again in linux?
[01:03] <OlliK> pvd2006: what does sudo -s do?
[01:03] <Corey> ok so gimpshop ill install :D
[01:03] <tomplast> can anyone tell me how to get a wine menu in gnome as you get in kde?
[01:04] <pinky> Ah, so it *is* the unfamiliarity.
[01:04] <pvd2006> sudo-s takes you to root logon then you can type commands as root.
[01:04] <pvd2006> then you can exit it out
[01:04] <blue-frog> and by the way photoshop is on the way to redefine it's interface as per the GIMP
[01:04] <johannes_erik> brn i had a brainstorm lol try #CC=gcc ./configure
[01:04] <rapha> Hi all! Is it possible to download binaries for Firefox 1.5.0+ *PPC* for Ubuntu *Breezy Badger* somewhere?
[01:04] <OlliK> pvd2006: ok, thanks
[01:04] <I_Love_DRM> as long as gimp does things my old jasc did im happy
[01:04] <pvd2006> np;)
[01:04] <spikeb> rapha: not likely
[01:04] <tomplast> guys?
[01:04] <OlliK> pvd2006: it still says the same
[01:04] <rapha> spikeb: so I'll have to upgrade to Flight 7 if I can't afford compiling it myself?
[01:05] <Corey> where can i find gimpshop ?
[01:05] <OlliK> pvd2006: adduser: The user 'myuser' does not exist.
[01:05] <spikeb> rapha: yes, or wait until dapper stable comes out
[01:05] <pvd2006> ollik, what exactly did you type?
[01:05] <Madpilot> Corey, google - I don't think it's in Ubuntu's repos
[01:05] <OlliK> pvd2006: adduser myuser mygroup
[01:05] <Corey> ah ok
[01:05] <OlliK> pvd2006: and that mygroup exists
[01:05] <Corey> how do i install things from downloads
[01:05] <Sandy16> ompaul: thnx abt the link
[01:05] <rapha> spikeb: That was my plan, but now I'm in a situation where I can't get on with my work due to certain limitations of FireFox 1.0 :-/
[01:05] <Corey> like a deb file ?
[01:05] <way2evil> hi
[01:06] <pinky> Corey: http://freshmeat.net/redir/gimpshop/57360/url_rpm/gimpshop.rpm.torrent
[01:06] <spikeb> rapha: you should be able to compile it, if yo uhave enough space
[01:06] <ompaul> Sandy16, yw
[01:06] <pvd2006> Ollik and this is after you typed sudo -s and then went to the root prompt right
[01:06] <pinky> That's a torrent to the latest GimpSHOP Linux RPM
[01:06] <OlliK> pvd2006: yes
[01:06] <Corey> thanks
[01:06] <tomplast> cant anyone tell me how to get a menu for installed wine applications in gnome?
[01:06] <pinky> Corey: direct link here: http://freshmeat.net/redir/gimpshop/57360/url_mirror/gimpshopbyme.rpm
[01:06] <OlliK> pvd2006: before doing sudo -s, it gave the same answer when I typed: sudo adduser myuser mygroup
[01:06] <pvd2006> That is strange
[01:06] <mihai> it's safe to upgrade to dapper now?
[01:07] <Ng> OlliK: are you literally typing "myuser" or your actual username?
[01:07] <OlliK> Ng: actual username
[01:07] <Corey> thanks pinky
[01:07] <way2evil> i am trying to install ubuntu on a partition with a dual boot of XP and ubuntu wont read the partition. what format does it need to be in? please PM me with reply this chat is filled
[01:07] <rapha> spikeb: no way. This is a 2001 iBook Clamshell with a 366MHz or so G3 and about 300MB of free disk space. Do you think it might be feasible to change the apt sources.list to Dapper and try an apt-get remove firefox && apt-get install firefox?
[01:07] <lukasz20> haloo
[01:07] <Corey> how do install thoe ?
[01:07] <spikeb> rapha: that would probably break things
[01:07] <spikeb> rapha: if it helps any, i use dapper on a mac mini with zero problems.
[01:07] <brn> Johannes:  Are you sure about the syntax?  #CC?  I will try it since it sure can't hurt.
[01:08] <johannes_erik> no # lol
[01:08] <Madpilot> rapha, masses of things depend on Firefox - you'd break things badly trying to just install FF from Dapper...
[01:08] <johannes_erik> brn its just the way ive always written commands lol
[01:08] <Corey> how do install files ?
[01:08] <rapha> Madpilot: I _would_ let it pull in the dependencies...
[01:09] <spikeb> Madpilot: any plans to abstract that out a bit so things don't depend on FF, but just <a browser> ?
[01:09] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell Corey about alien
[01:09] <Corey> also, is the HD version of ubuntu faster than livecd ?
[01:09] <rapha> spikeb: yeah, gives me kind of a fuzzy feeling. But that probably means that our intern won't have her PC available to her today :)
[01:09] <spikeb> rapha: haha
[01:09] <Madpilot> Corey, the installed version is much faster
[01:09] <Corey> :D
[01:09] <pinky> Corey: You can use alien to install RPM files.
[01:09] <Madpilot> spikeb, no idea - you'd have to ask the developers
[01:09] <pvd2006> how well does alien word?
[01:10] <Corey> ok thanks
[01:10] <pvd2006> work*
[01:10] <brn> Johannes:  Yep.  Tried it all ways.  Same result.  But we have tried and I am grateful for your help anyway.  Getting late (early) here in California and there are other things to do.  Thanks again.
[01:10] <rapha> spikeb: is there a chance I will be able to upgrade from Flight 7 to Dapper Drake Final when it is released without have to reinstall again?
[01:10] <spikeb> rapha: yeah, i believe so
[01:10] <spikeb> rapha: that's actually the assumption i'm working on for my install
[01:10] <johannes_erik> brn ok sry , seems gcc is at fault :(
[01:10] <Corey> is there a better messenger than gaim ?
[01:10] <spikeb> Corey: define better
[01:10] <johannes_erik> brn good night/good morning , only noon here in scotland yet tho :)
[01:11] <rapha> spikeb: kay, thx!
[01:11] <tribe> i use kopete under kde :}
[01:11] <Corey> um
[01:11] <Corey> better looking and more features
[01:11] <spikeb> Corey: what sort of features?
[01:11] <HymnToLife> Like the non-ability to send files via MSN :p
[01:12] <christo_> Somewhat new to ubuntu, trying to install xchat on Dapper, apt-get says 'Couldnt' find package xchat'. Is this because it hasn't been packaged yet for Dapper?
[01:12] <Corey> um msn 7.5
=== Tedd is now known as Tedd|School
[01:12] <brn> Johannes:  Yes.  I sometimes wish there was somone my age around to explain the mystery/misery of the 'C' language and it's compiler to me.  Sadly, most of them are dead now.
[01:12] <spikeb> well
[01:12] <Corey> ok i downloaded the alien.tar.gz
[01:12] <spikeb> Corey: aMSN has many more MSN features.
[01:12] <Corey> i opened it and there is all this stuff um..
[01:12] <Madpilot> Corey, just install alien thru Synaptic
[01:12] <christo_> r
[01:13] <Corey> ok how just select it ?
[01:13] <Madpilot> Corey, System->Admin->Synaptic Package Manager
[01:13] <bimberi> christo_: it's in the universe repository
[01:13] <johannes_erik> brn we struggle finding ppl who know about computers up here in the highlands :D
[01:13] <bimberi> !tell christo_ about universe
[01:13] <Madpilot> Corey, delete the file you just downloaded, you don't need that for alien
[01:13] <Corey> oh ok
[01:14] <brn> johannes:  Save just a wee dram of that ancient hand-made malt beverage for me.  If I don't make it to Scotland, drink it in memory.
[01:14] <pvd2006> Oh yeah, had a question. When I update and get a list of all this kde stuff on the update list is it going to install that stuff? I have random kde stuff like browsing cds through konqeruer and such things.
[01:15] <pvd2006> I have xubuntu, so I dont know why all this extra kde stuff is on there.
[01:15] <johannes_erik> brn :)) will do, hope you make it over here at some point
[01:15] <Corey> lol i will have to install this all over agagin
[01:15] <Corey> but i want to fully test so its going good :)
=== tribe is now known as tribe`afk
[01:16] <Corey> how do i install files with alien now ?
[01:17] <YoussefAssad> I have an odd problem. When I bring up a network interface, gtk applications can't be started
[01:17] <Madpilot> need sleep - later, all
[01:17] <trym> is there an easy way of getting svn to support https ?
[01:17] <johannes_erik> All : I am trying to get my ubuntu box to basicaly bridge a ppp0 and eth0 connection , how best would i go about this ?
[01:17] <Corey> how do i install .rpm ?
[01:17] <pvd2006> johannes, you want to run a adsl connection?
[01:18] <johannes_erik> i got an adsl connection , typed up some scripts for hotplug and it runs nicely on ppp0
[01:18] <HymnToLife> johannes_erik> you mean to share the PPP connection over the network ?
[01:18] <johannes_erik> tested it on apt-get seems fine
[01:18] <johannes_erik> HymToLife basically what i want to do! :)
[01:19] <HymnToLife> johannes_erik> then install Firestarter
[01:19] <HymnToLife> and dhcp3-server
[01:19] <shadedpast> sup all
[01:19] <johannes_erik> its going into a router after that so im not to fussed about dhcp (although ive already set dhcp up 8-)  )
[01:19] <HymnToLife> in fact, install dhcp3-server first
[01:19] <Corey> how do i installe .rpm ? i downloaded and installed alien
[01:19] <HymnToLife> then if you have a router it should do the sharing
[01:20] <Nookie^> Corey: u need to make a deb package
[01:20] <Corey> ok how ?
[01:20] <HymnToLife> Corey> alien filename.rmp
[01:20] <Nookie^> Corey: alien -d packagename.rpm
[01:20] <Corey> ok
[01:20] <ompaul> !alien
[01:20] <ubotu> alien is, like, totally, a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[01:21] <Corey> it said
[01:21] <johannes_erik> ill try explain :)   |INET USBMODEM| --> |UBUNTU BOX| --> |ROUTER| --> |NETWORK|
[01:21] <Corey> i must run as root ?
[01:21] <pvd2006> sudo alien -d packagename.rpm
[01:21] <ompaul> !tell corey about alien
[01:21] <usuario> hola a todos
[01:21] <ompaul> !es
[01:21] <johannes_erik> HymnToLife thats about the best i can explain lol :)
[01:21] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[01:21] <HymnToLife> johannes_erik> the router is useless here
[01:21] <johannes_erik> how ?
[01:22] <Corey> um
[01:22] <Corey> i did that
[01:22] <HymnToLife> because your Ubuntu box will do the job
[01:22] <Corey> and it came up with usage :sudo
[01:22] <Corey> and all this other stuff
[01:22] <ompaul> Corey, read the message from the bot
[01:22] <ompaul> !tell Corey about paste
[01:22] <johannes_erik> ahh forgot to mention its a wireless router and most my network is wireless
[01:22] <Corey> usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
[01:22] <Corey> usage: sudo [-HPSb]  [-p prompt]  [-u username|#uid] 
[01:22] <Corey>             { -e file [...]  | -i | -s | <command> }
[01:22] <usuario> algunos espaoles???
[01:22] <HymnToLife> !es
[01:22] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[01:22] <Corey> oh wait
[01:22] <Corey> it said illegal option -d
[01:23] <pvd2006> Corey, be careful not to paste too much stuff into the chat directly;)
[01:23] <Corey> sudo illegal ption -d
[01:23] <Corey> is that private data ?
[01:23] <HymnToLife> johannes_erik> I have very little eperience with Wireless
[01:23] <Nookie^> alien --help
[01:23] <pvd2006> na, iuts just there are so many people it can flood.
[01:23] <johannes_erik> HymnToLife the ubuntu box is in the internet port on my router which means the rest of the network see the router as the inet gateway although it only forwards to the inet port which is the ubuntu machine
[01:24] <Corey> what do i want to generate to ?
[01:24] <HymnToLife> johannes_erik> so ann you need is Firestarter
[01:24] <johannes_erik> so in effect all the ubuntu box needs to do is "bridge" (terminiology ??) the two
[01:24] <Corey> its rpm what do i want to make it ?
[01:24] <HymnToLife> to setup the connection sharing on the eth
[01:25] <pvd2006> Yeah I dont understand why sudo doesnt work with some commands?
[01:25] <johannes_erik> i heard about firestarter , but can it run on a base system ? no X or gui ?
[01:25] <johannes_erik> i thought it was an X app , im posiabley wrong!
[01:25] <HymnToLife> no, it's a GUI for iptables
[01:25] <pvd2006> sudo alien -d packagename.rpm doesnt work Corey?
[01:25] <h3sp4wn> <johannes_erik>: You don't really need firestarted for such a simple case
[01:25] <HymnToLife> you'll have to set your iptables rule manually then
[01:25] <HymnToLife> !iptables
[01:25] <FliesLikeABrick> #iptables
[01:26] <johannes_erik> HymnToLife ive done my iptables but it just dont wanna go :'(
[01:26] <h3sp4wn> "/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE"
[01:26] <johannes_erik> HymnToLife i could be editing my iptables wrong , is there a CLI editor ?
[01:27] <Corey> in terminal how do i specify where the file is ?
[01:27] <Corey> like the file i want to unpack is on the desktop
[01:27] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn hi , i tried that still it wont route the traffic
[01:27] <h3sp4wn> net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 needs to be in /etc/sysctl.conf
[01:27] <pvd2006> corey cd ~/Desktop I believe
[01:27] <Corey> sudo alien -g file.rpm
=== jimmy____ is now known as jimMmy
[01:27] <Corey> ok
[01:27] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn yip added that too
[01:27] <ompaul> Corey, you do realise your risking breaking your machine
[01:27] <Corey> why ?
[01:28] <ompaul> !alien
[01:28] <ubotu> [alien]  a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[01:28] <pvd2006> Corey, Yeah I dont know why someone recommended alien ive heard problems with it.
[01:28] <Corey> ... o
[01:28] <pvd2006> Corey, what are you trying to install?
[01:28] <Corey> how do I instal rpm files then ?
[01:28] <ompaul> Corey, you don't just grab some random piece of software and think "I'll have this"
[01:28] <Corey> gimpshop
[01:28] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Can you get a shell on the router ?
[01:29] <pvd2006> Corey, do you have the link?
[01:29] <ompaul> Corey, you dont do rpm you do debs specifically deb files for Ubuntu
[01:29] <Corey> what are the file extensions i can install  ? tar.gz ?
[01:29] <Corey> deb um
[01:29] <pvd2006> ompaul, I dont think they have .deb its a tar.gz most likely.
[01:29] <Corey> its gimpshop pro
[01:29] <Corey> just a second
[01:29] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn yip thats ok and i can see the trafic reach the machine with tcpdump but it doesnt get passed on
[01:30] <pvd2006> so hes gonna have to learn how to install programs the fun way:)
[01:30] <ompaul> pvd2006, so he can get that, I am not being use case specific
[01:30] <pvd2006> Corey, its not hard at all to install a tar.gz
[01:30] <FliesLikeABrick> alien should usually be the last choice for installing
[01:30] <johannes_erik> pvd2006 u mean install programs the REAL way :))
[01:30] <pvd2006> hehe
[01:30] <Corey> ok um well jsut wait ill find the gimpshop site
[01:31] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Have you tried source nat instead of masquarading
[01:31] <Corey> which one do i download for gimpshop ?
[01:31] <Corey> http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294
[01:31] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn never heard of "source nat" , hows that work ?
[01:33] <corey_> could someone help me with mpalyer plugin and ff1.5?
[01:33] <johannes_erik> corey theres a page on the ubuntu wiki about ff1.5
[01:33] <corey_> i know
[01:33] <corey_> i got 1.5 installed
[01:33] <corey_> i cant get mplayer working with it though

[01:36] <corey_> i installed the plugin, its not working
[01:36] <Corey> how do i install deb ?
[01:37] <pvd2006> Corey, It just seems youll need to install some dependencies before you install that .deb package though
[01:37] <johannes_erik> corey_ is there an error or does it not do anything ?
[01:37] <corey_> no error, just doesnt work
[01:37] <Corey> install some depenedices ok

[01:52] <Hoxzer> U guys know any good way to speed up ubuntu boot?
[01:52] <Evanescent> it tells me there is no root file system and to go back and correct it using the partitioning tool, but i don't know how
[01:52] <Evanescent> can anyone help?
[01:52] <pvd2006> ohh, you need to select / as the mount point
[01:53] <johannes_erik> trym think u have to build it in and compile :(
[01:53] <pvd2006> evanescant
[01:53] <Evanescent> but how do i do that?
[01:53] <christo_> aye
[01:53] <pvd2006> hmm, I dont remember the screen exactly but when you select the partition you want to use there should be something you can click to change the mountpoint.
[01:53] <pvd2006> Evanescent:
[01:54] <Evanescent> ah ok i got it
[01:54] <Evanescent> i need to read what it says onscreen a bit more carefully
[01:54] <Evanescent> it's a few years since i played with linux
[01:55] <pvd2006>  I had the same problem
[01:55] <Evanescent> but something u said jogged my memory :)
[01:55] <Evanescent> thanks
[01:55] <pvd2006> np;)
[01:56] <Evanescent> great the base system is installing :)
[01:56] <johannes_erik> ohh yeah while i mind : Does anyone know a good way to edit iptables , not teribly good with these lol ??
[01:57] <Evanescent> i can't even remember what they're for lol
[01:57] <pvd2006> not me, i use firestarter, im too scared to edit iptables:-\.
[01:57] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Do you have a default gateway set on the wired interface ?
[01:58] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Do you bring up ppp0 thru /etc/network/interfaces ?
[01:58] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn i can see it through ifconfig so it should be good
[01:59] <watson540> hello can someone help me here? I just installed Xgl and my 'Super/Windows' key o0n my keyboard isnt working, i suspect its because in my xorg.conf i have my keyboard set to 'pc104' or is this an xmodmap problem does nayone know/?
[01:59] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn thanks for the help btw :) this routing is driving me mad lol
[02:01] <viller> hi
[02:01] <watson540> someone knows im sure
[02:01] <Taru> Anyone know how to fix the terminal?
[02:01] <snowfaked> type reset
[02:01] <viller> can't I use restricted formats on dapper flight 7? I mean can I get them from the repos?
[02:01] <snowfaked> and also press enter afterwards ;)
[02:01] <Taru> My terminal will disappear in few seconds after I launch it.
[02:02] <Taru> I don't know how to get it back to normal.
[02:02] <Taru> I made changes to it like appearance and background and stuff.
[02:02] <corey> yea, mplayer plugin still not working
[02:02] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: pastebin the output of 'iptables -t nat -L' and 'route'
[02:03] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Can you ping ipaddresses (for example 194.112.32.1 which I know is up) from behind ?
[02:03] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok can do the second bit but whats pastebin lol ?
[02:03] <h3sp4wn> !pastebin
[02:03] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[02:04] <viller> can I install restricted formats encoders on Dapper Flight 7?
[02:04] <spikeb> yeah
[02:04] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok :)
[02:04] <christo_> in my xorg,conf, where I set up my video card I need values for Driver, VideoRam,  BusID. Where can I find these please?
[02:05] <johannes_erik> i cant ping external addesses from behind the ubuntu box although i can FROM the ubuntu box
[02:06] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Can you get to the ubuntu from behind ?
[02:06] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn i did tcpdump and from a machine behind it i tried opening a few pages
[02:07] <johannes_erik> the packets reached the ubuntu box but went no further
[02:08] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: can you ssh from behind to the ubuntu box (the router could be mangling the packets)
[02:08] <Sjors> When i am compiling my intel drivers i get this error; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14458
[02:09] <hyphenated> Sjors: the 'dri.log' it refers to might be more useful to find out specifically what failed
[02:09] <MSch_> can i update a debian sarge installation to ubuntu without a big headache afterwards?
[02:09] <Sjors> 1 mom.
[02:09] <spikeb> MSch_: no
[02:09] <hyphenated> MSch_: I doubt that'd be a good idea
[02:10] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn i just tried with only the ubuntu machine and a switch and it was exactly the same
[02:10] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn seems the router is behaving
[02:10] <Sjors> My DRI.log: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14459
[02:10] <Ng> MSch_: I think it's just about possible to go sarge->breezy, but it's really not a good idea
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[02:11] <hyphenated> Sjors: can't find kernel config file :-)
[02:11] <jackeye> when i try to compile the new xmoto i get this
[02:11] <jackeye> http://pastebin.ca/57987
[02:11] <MSch_> ok... it's only my private samba server i'll just have to stay up late today
[02:11] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok i got the two tables ill have to hand copy them , im not using that machine that im setting up
[02:11] <Sjors> I've intalled the source and headers already :S
[02:11] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Why not
[02:11] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: You should be able to get to it with ssh
[02:12] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: If you cannot then that implies to me its a problem with the router
[02:12] <Evanescent> well, it seems to like my 2nd pc better than my main one
[02:12] <hyphenated> Sjors: well, the intel thingee can't find them

[02:13] <hyphenated> MSch_: if something works, I don't go out of my way to break it ;-)
[02:13] <Sjors> i looked in the directory and there is my source.. But there is no map named build :S
[02:13] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: Its nothing to do with the ppp0 connection or masquarading whether you can get to the internal interface of the ubuntu box
[02:13] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn im using two independant machines and networks
[02:13] <corey> gosh why wont it work
[02:14] <j2daosh> how do i search my entire drive for a file?
[02:14] <johannes_erik> the network im setting up  is completely seperate from the one im using just now
[02:14] <j2daosh> locate and find return to the prompt too quickly
[02:14] <corey> !ff1.5
[02:14] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[02:14] <j2daosh> so i think they only check in the current directory
[02:14] <jackeye> man find
[02:15] <hyphenated> j2daosh: locate is quick because it uses a cache it prepared earlier to search for things
[02:15] <Evanescent> does ubuntu have an irc client?
[02:15] <MSch_> hyphenated: well the only packages that worry me are grub, linux-image and lvm.
[02:15] <hyphenated> Evanescent: uh.. the fact that we're all here should be clue #1 ;-)
[02:16] <MSch_> Evanescent: isn't xchat installed by default?
[02:16] <j2daosh> hyphenated, yeah but i have about 70 gigs worth of files all over the drive it needs to look in but it comes back in like 3 seconds...
[02:16] <Evanescent> yeah i just wanna know if it's in the default installation and where i can find it
[02:16] <j2daosh> it should take alittle longer then that
[02:16] <jackeye> how can i fix it?
[02:16] <hyphenated> Evanescent: should be in the default desktop install
[02:16] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14460
[02:17] <Evanescent> thanks MSch and hyphenated
[02:17] <jackeye> http://pastebin.ca/57987
[02:17] <jackeye> when i compile xmoto
[02:17] <xjudas> hello, is there any site where every compiz effects is described?
[02:17] <rgolden_> morning, how can I change icons for apps, all files are greyed when I attempt to choose
[02:17] <hyphenated> j2daosh: if you want, you can run 'sudo updatedb' (which will take a while) and then run locate again
[02:17] <Evanescent> it's just configuring so i'll find out in a minute or 3
[02:17] <j2daosh> it dont even take 3 seconds... right after i hit enter on the command "locate qt-libs" it brings me back to the prompt
[02:17] <Evanescent> 66% complete
[02:17] <hyphenated> j2daosh: then your 'locate' database will be nice and fresh. and probably just as snappy
[02:17] <j2daosh> hyphenated, just did that
[02:18] <atomical> What do I need to capture say realplayer streams im watching, or audio streams???
[02:18] <j2daosh> hyphenated, can i use wild cards during a locate?
[02:19] <atomical> and whats the most secure/best proxy server to use?
[02:19] <j2daosh> i cant seem to get the qt software loaded and its really pissing me off because it cant find this stupid qt-libs file/directory
[02:19] <hyphenated> j2daosh: you can use a regular expression
[02:19] <Tenshi> whenever I try to do a connect-to-server to a samba share, it keeps telling me that smb://user@server/share  is an invalid url.  Is there a samba plugin or another package that I need to add to  nautilus to add smb:// support to it?
[02:20] <j2daosh> what is a regular expression again? in lamens terms...
[02:20] <h3sp4wn> atmical: squid is pretty good
[02:20] <Tenshi> j2daosh, filesbeginning with foo*
[02:20] <hyphenated> j2daosh: a form of magic used by UNIX wizards. See also: vi
[02:20] <Tenshi> *.mp3
[02:20] <jesse_> Hello I have a really bizzare problem. Ubuntu (hoary) has somehow reversed the recognition of my dvd player and cd player.
[02:20] <j2daosh> ahh
[02:20] <j2daosh> gotcha
[02:20] <hyphenated> Tenshi: no, that's a glob
[02:20] <jesse_> What I mean is that when I type eject hdd ina command line, the cd ejects instead of the dvd.
[02:21] <atomical> h3sp4wn, does it run on BSD?
[02:21] <Tenshi> hyphenated: depends on the context
[02:21] <atomical> wait yeah it does.
[02:21] <atomical> I think
[02:21] <h3sp4wn> atmical: BSD or linux
[02:21] <hyphenated> Tenshi: nope, they are distinctly different
[02:21] <Ng> jesse_: they will appear in the order the kernel sees them. are they USB drives by any chance?
[02:21] <hyphenated> '*.mp3' is a valid glob, but not a valid regular expression
[02:21] <j2daosh> tenshi, all you should need to do is go to places (bottom on the toolbar) network servers, then go from there
[02:21] <atomical> capture card is all I need to capture and record realplayer streams?
[02:22] <jesse_> no they are not usb drives
[02:22] <Tenshi> j2daosh, no ... says it's invalid even when I try to browse.  This began as soon as I dist-upgraded to dapper
[02:22] <Tenshi> "invalid url sbm://"
[02:22] <Tenshi> er... "smb:/"
[02:22] <Ng> jesse_: hmm. I wouldn't expect the order to change after install then. I'm not sure there's anything you can do to change the order back unfortunately.
[02:22] <j2daosh> oh... i dont have dapper :) imma wait till its alittle more stable
[02:22] <j2daosh> tenshi... there is a new dapper room though
[02:22] <jesse_> Ng: can the kernal recognize them differently then what is in fstab
[02:23] <hyphenated> Tenshi: ask in #ubuntu+1 , they might know the answer to that one
[02:23] <Tenshi> hyphenated, k, will do that
[02:23] <atomical> dapper has been good on mylaptop
[02:23] <atomical> no probs
[02:23] <jesse_> I mean my dvd is mounted to hdd
[02:23] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn i just connected the machine in question and tried to ssh to it and i get connection refused
[02:23] <Tenshi> hyphenated, curious though, how are you differentiating a glob from a regular expression?
[02:23] <jesse_> but when i eject hdd
[02:23] <hyphenated> I'll try dapper in a couple of weeks
[02:23] <jesse_> then my cd player ejects
[02:23] <h3sp4wn> johannes_erik: You need to install openssh-server
[02:24] <hyphenated> Tenshi: in many ways. the meaning of * and ? are very different between a glob and a regular expression
[02:24] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok will try that
[02:25] <hyphenated> Tenshi: man 7 glob, man 7 regex ;-)
[02:25] <hyphenated> those won't actually make it clearer ;-)
[02:25] <Tenshi> I thought the syntax of a regular expression was completely contextual based on the language
[02:25] <Tenshi> interpreter, etc ...
[02:26] <hyphenated> in general, globs are for filenames, and regexes are for text. things that interpret them have all sorts of syntaxes around the actual regex
[02:26] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok installed now but its asking for a password i dont know lol , new can of worms has been opend i thinks lol
[02:27] <Tenshi> hyphenated, sounds awfully like a matter of context to me :)
[02:27] <hyphenated> Tenshi: yeah, but you can't use a glob when it wants a regular expression
[02:27] <hyphenated> they just won't work
[02:27] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: You just login with the same username and password that you use to login from the console
[02:27] <Tenshi> hyphenated, again ... it depends on the context ;)
[02:27] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn just ignor that last bit i got it , just me being daft
[02:28] <Tenshi> some globs ARE valid regular expressions
[02:28] <twopeak> hello, I have a problem making my third harddrive work. I see it in gPart (and formatted it to FAT32), but when I try to "enable" it in Administration>Disks then it won't work.
[02:28] <hyphenated> Tenshi: naw, a glob to match mp3 files would be '*.mp3', a regex to match them would be '^.*\.mp3$'
[02:28] <hyphenated> and the meaning of the '*' is different for them too
[02:28] <Tenshi> hyphenated, only in perl style syntax
[02:29] <Tenshi> :)
[02:29] <hyphenated> Tenshi: nope, perl-style syntax would be different yet again
[02:29] <Tenshi> though I haven't worked with perl and python regex in several months
[02:29] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: sudo sysctl net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 && sudo iptables -F && /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE (Just try that as one line you may have things that are stopping iptables from working)
[02:29] <Tenshi> it's always a relearning process every time I have to do it
[02:30] <hyphenated> yeah, unless you actively use them, you'll forget bits and pieces
[02:30] <Evanescent> 153 updates... that's worse than windblows
[02:31] <atomical> i have a good script that includes the proper sysctl kernel options
[02:31] <Tenshi> hyphenated, and they get ugly really quickly :(
[02:31] <DBO> Evanescent, just install?
[02:31] <Evanescent> yeah
[02:31] <atomical> wait
[02:31] <DBO> Evanescent, yeah thats normal, but it dies off quick, of course the dapper upgrade comes soon...
[02:31] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok will try
[02:31] <twopeak> can anyone help me with my harddrive problem?
[02:31] <Evanescent> my first experience of ubuntu
[02:31] <DBO> Evanescent, welcome aboard
[02:31] <spikeb> updates are not windows' problem
[02:31] <atomical> Evanescent, welcome to Ubuntu
[02:32] <spikeb> the fact that they don't fix the problems has more to do with it
[02:32] <Evanescent> DBO: i applied for the new version 6.06 on disc
[02:32] <sr71>  a lot more user friendly then red hat
[02:32] <hyphenated> Tenshi: especially if you use POSIX character classes instead of Perl-Compatible (PCRE) ones. eg: [[:space:] ]  instead of \s or somesuch
[02:32] <Evanescent> yeah that's why i installed it to see how i get on with it
[02:32] <atomical> Evanescent, 6.06 is a great product
[02:33] <Evanescent> i've used mandrake before
[02:33] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn it displayed net.ipv4.ip_forward =1 and now its frozen :-O
[02:33] <Tenshi> hyphenated, I was doing some spam research during my masters.  We had gigs of logs to sort through.  It's amazing how many ways you can represent a hostname and email address ...
[02:33] <twopeak> does the jumper on a harddrive change something if a disk is readable or not?
[02:34] <Evanescent> and the more operating systems i can get familiar with the better as i'm training as a DST
[02:34] <hyphenated> Tenshi: yeah, I would have googled for an expression someone worked out already instead of trying to make up my own :-)
[02:34] <Tenshi> I just installed manpages, but no /usr/bin/man to be found anywhere
[02:34] <Tenshi> is it supposed to be somewhere else?
[02:35] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: Was that from the console or ssh ?
[02:35] <hyphenated> Tenshi: and 'LANG=C awk' (or whatever equivalent you use) will be a bunch of times faster (about 5) since it doesn't have to convert character sets
[02:35] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn from ssh
[02:35] <sr71> dst?
[02:35] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn the console is still running but i think SSH has frozen as it doest respond anymore
[02:35] <Tenshi> hyphenated, actually, I was using python at the time :)
[02:36] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: Flushing all the firewall rules will terminate the connections in process
[02:36] <hyphenated> Tenshi: it probably still would have helped
[02:36] <hyphenated> maybe not so much, since python uses unicode types a lot internally.
[02:37] <Evanescent> (sr71) dst?: desktop support technician
[02:37] <sr71> oh ok
[02:37] <Tenshi> yeah, but I was taking all of my results and building relational databases with it, so I needed a decent language to handle the data once I stripped it
[02:37] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok so should i run that from the console instead?
[02:37] <Evanescent> but it's mainly based in windows :(
[02:37] <Evanescent> but i want to take the comptia linux+
[02:38] <hyphenated> Tenshi: ah, other things would have been slower than the parsing of the text then.
[02:38] <Amit> hello
[02:38] <Tenshi> hyphenated, actually, the mysql server was off-lan, so the IO between that was by far the bottleneck
[02:38] <Amit> anybody can help me?
[02:38] <sr71> hello amit
[02:38] <miranda82> hello
[02:39] <Amit> well i just installed ubuntu 5.10 on a new partition and when I look at the grub menu it does give my win xp as choice to boot
[02:39] <Amit> what can be done?
[02:39] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: Yep - do them one at a time without the && if you want
[02:39] <Amit> it does not*
[02:40] <sr71> you probley partioned the whole drive
[02:40] <Amit> no
[02:40] <Amit> winxp was on another hdd
[02:41] <plh> now do i update all my icons and artwork? i installed as dapper f5, and i noticed the newest dapper that i install on another computer
[02:41] <plh> has new artwork and icons
=== Kadran__ is now known as Kadran
[02:41] <sr71> OK so xp was on slave drive?
[02:41] <hyphenated> plh: #ubuntu+1
[02:41] <Amit> yes sr71
[02:41] <sr71> OK
[02:42] <Amit> i had win98 on my master and i installed ubuntu on it
[02:42] <plh> hyphenated: oh. thanks
[02:42] <twopeak> Can someone tell me in grub: what's the use of having a ubuntu recover mode
[02:42] <sr71> Then I think I know the prob
[02:42] <hyphenated> twopeak: in case you screw things up
[02:42] <Amit> ok
[02:42] <Amit> hope you have the solution :D
[02:42] <sr71> to dual boot you need both os on one drive
[02:42] <twopeak> hyphenated, thanks.
[02:43] <hyphenated> twopeak: it boots you into single-user mode and lets you fix your mistake
[02:43] <Amit> ok
[02:43] <Amit> so what can be done?
[02:43] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn ok ran it , didnt get much output but no errors
[02:43] <killercacti> and recover mode boots automatically into console, right
[02:43] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: Now try pinging an ip from behind
[02:44] <jack-> from below rocks too, or from above if you feel crazy
[02:45] <sr71> Amin do you have partion magic?
[02:45] <Amit> i have it on winxp
[02:45] <Amit> does it exist on ubuntu also?
[02:45] <miranda82> Amit, use gparted
[02:46] <hyphenated> he doesn't have a partition problem
[02:46] <sr71> it is a seprate program not sure but it should work on both
[02:46] <hyphenated> he has a grub configuration problem
[02:46] <Amit> yes
[02:46] <miranda82> hyphenated, i just arrived and read that: Amin do you have partion magic?
[02:47] <Amit> well sr71  do you i need to download partition magic for ubuntu?
[02:47] <miranda82> Amit, what happens? Sorry i just arrived
[02:47] <sr71> if his hard drive is slave and the os is on it he does
[02:47] <Amit> well i just installed ubuntu 5.10 on my master hdd
[02:47] <Amit> but i have win xp on my slave hdd
[02:47] <Amit> which isnt in the grub menu when i boot
[02:47] <miranda82> oh
[02:48] <sr71> you need both os's on one hd
[02:48] <Amit> i want to be able to boot winxp also
[02:48] <miranda82> that's easy to do
[02:48] <hyphenated> Amit: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=173028
[02:48] <khaled> Amit, you just need to conifgure grub
[02:48] <Amit> well help me

[02:50] <miranda82> Amit, www.pastebin.com
[02:50] <hyphenated> Amit: this is not the pastebin ;-)
[02:51] <hyphenated> Amit: and the link I gave you is for precisely your problem
[02:51] <jel> how big should i make /boot ? i need to make a seperate boot partition...
[02:51] <sorush20> guys how do I merge iso images into one.. the iso images are videos mpeg but I want to merge the into one.. is that possible?
[02:51] <Evanescent> can anyone tell me how to login as root?
[02:51] <miranda82> as we can see
[02:51] <hyphenated> ubotu: tell Evanescent about sudo
[02:51] <miranda82> he sees hdb
[02:51] <Subhuman> Evanescent, root is disabled, if you need root use sudo
[02:51] <miranda82> the second hardrive,
[02:51] <MSch_> jel: each kernel image is approx. 10 mb big...
[02:51] <Evanescent> sudo?
[02:51] <hyphenated> Evanescent: read the link ubotu gave you
[02:51] <miranda82> Amit, still there?
[02:52] <Amit> yes
[02:52] <jel> MSch - so 50mb would be enough for /boot ?
[02:52] <Amit> i am here
[02:52] <Evanescent> ok thanks
[02:52] <Amit> miranda82, what do i need to do?
[02:52] <miranda82> Amit, can u just se pastebin.com to put the output?
[02:52] <MSch_> jel: well, i use 200 MB because i ran into problems with 70 MB, but i used the unstable dapper with a new kernel every second week
[02:52] <TobiasFar> what's the root password for mysql or where do i find it?
[02:52] <miranda82> Amit, it would be easier for me to guide u
[02:52] <hyphenated> Amit: I already gave you a link telling you what to do
[02:52] <Amit> ok wait
[02:52] <hyphenated> Amit: was it not good enough?
[02:53] <jel> ok i'll give it 150mb
[02:53] <h3sp4wn> jel: 100 will be more than enough - the most important thing is that its the first partition on the disk
[02:53] <jel> oh
[02:53] <jel> thats a problem then
[02:54] <jel> it will be the 3rd
[02:54] <h3sp4wn> There is not much point in doing that if its not the first partition on the disk
[02:54] <jel> im not installing from the live cd...
[02:54] <void^> boot doesn't have to be 1st partition
[02:54] <hyphenated> jel: third partition or third disk?
[02:54] <jel> third partition
[02:54] <blue-frog> TobiasFar, ther is no root password for mysql when you hace just installed it
[02:54] <hyphenated> the rule about it being near the beginning of the disk isn't so important on new hardware
[02:55] <void^> it matters only on older mainboards that have problems booting high cyl partitions
[02:55] <miranda82> Amit, ?
[02:55] <jel> i was told XFS and grub cannot be on the same partition
[02:55] <Amit> yes
[02:55] <TobiasFar> blue-frog, okay
[02:55] <Amit> am on pastebin.com
[02:55] <jel> and grub is a real pain in the ass to get working presently, so i figured i would just make a new /boot partition, so the kubuntu installed (dapper) can handle it
[02:55] <jel> :D
[02:55] <miranda82> Amit, paste it... if u want help..
[02:55] <Amit> it's like taking forever when i clicked on the send button
[02:55] <TobiasFar> thx
[02:55] <hyphenated> jel: well, grub understands ext3. if it understands xfs then you'll be ok. I don't know if it does or not
[02:55] <miranda82> Amit, ok i wait

[02:56] <jel> does grub understand reiser ?
[02:56] <gnomefreak> ^^^ doesnt have the issues that pastebin.com has been having
[02:56] <miranda82> Amit, just reload the page, and resendit, or whatever..
[02:56] <void^> jel: yes. but a separate boot partition doesn't hurt anyway
[02:57] <miranda82> or use the webboard
[02:57] <Amit> is the website slow or what?
[02:57] <Amit> it's just saying waiting for pastebin.com...
[02:57] <blue-frog> TobiasFar, to set a password... mysqladmin -u root password "new_password"
[02:58] <miranda82> Amit, try then http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[02:59] <Amit> ok
[02:59] <Amit> it works
[02:59] <Amit> already sent
[02:59] <Amit> on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[02:59] <jel> so what should i make /boot ?
[02:59] <jel> ext3?
[02:59] <jel> JFS?
[02:59] <jel> reiser ?
[02:59] <khaled> ext3
[02:59] <jel> it shouldnt make any diff right?

[03:14] <tarun> Perkin, get Sun's J2SDK
[03:15] <Amit> well when i choose windows on the menu
[03:15] <munzir> MSch_: isn't there is a direct way like chkconfig in rpm-based distros?
[03:15] <Amit> it get stucks to the screen where the lines are as follows: .. Booting 'Windows"..
[03:15] <ompaul> !Xinerama
[03:15] <stjepan> anyone here uses gnome-dictionary?
[03:15] <ubotu> Check these URLs out and hopefully it works for you: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaHowTo or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaMultipleMonitors maybe  http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/xfree/Xinerama-HOWTO/
[03:15] <gnomefreak> munzir: dont know maybe ask in a rpm distros channel?
[03:15] <gnomefreak> ompaul: thank you sir
[03:16] <miranda82> Amit, does that windows installation work? xD
[03:16] <Perkin> ok, i'll see what i do
[03:16] <MSch_> munzir: there's the services menu in gnome but i don't know what chkconfig does
[03:16] <Perkin> thanks anyway
[03:16] <ubuntu> no... I have tried to change a nfts partition from Windows with partition magic but it generates Error 732 and I can not change it...
[03:16] <Amit> yeah it worked fine before i installed ubuntu
[03:16] <Amit> i mean now i cant boot it
[03:16] <seanh> Hi I just started using LyX on Breezy and I notice that the font seems to have a bug with the character 'f' not displaying properly, is there a solution known for this?
[03:16] <miranda82> Amit, don t really know, though my solution was working
[03:17] <gnomefreak> brb
[03:17] <munzir> gnomefreak: sorry! should I ask in fedora channel a question what's the equivalent command of chkconfig in ubutnu?!
[03:17] <miranda82> it should work btw
[03:17] <Evanescent> heh brb i found xchat
[03:17] <Amit> miranda82, what's the command to look into menu.lst?
[03:17] <seanh> Specifically, it seems to be f's that have been cut-pasted into LyX form elsewhere, and uppercase f's. If I type a lowercase f into LyX directly it looks fine
[03:17] <Amit> the one you gave me before
[03:18] <miranda82> sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[03:18] <Amit> ok thanks
[03:18] <gnomefreak> munzir: you asked isnt there a direct way to like chkconfig in rpm-based distros
[03:18] <gnomefreak> sorry but i dont see ubuntu nor debian mentioned in that
[03:18] <gnomefreak> brb
[03:19] <munzir> MSch_: the services menu in gnome didn't give me the runlevels. besides I want to do it from a command line. In gentoo I guess they have rc-status -all
[03:19] <ubuntu> anyone know why can not apply any changes with partition magic and Error 732 is generated?
[03:20] <munzir> gnomefreak: sorry if my question is  not clear. is it clear now or still need clarification?
[03:20] <munzir> gnomefreak: in fedora I use chkconfig in ubuntu I don't know what to use
[03:21] <Perkin> how do i close a channel in irssi?
[03:21] <elkbuntu> you type /part
[03:22] <MSch_> munzir: what's wrong with ls /etc/rc?.d
[03:22] <gnomefreak> munzir: i relized what you were asking as i was typing it hence the sorry part of it
[03:24] <SeLaB> i need help
[03:24] <SeLaB> today is my first day on ubuntu
[03:24] <SeLaB> please tell me
[03:24] <SeLaB> where to get started
[03:24] <MSch_> SeLaB: depends on what you want to do...
[03:24] <SeLaB> and also the commdands used for ubuntu
[03:24] <lastnode> what is the bash command to format a disk?
[03:25] <MSch_> lastnode: mkfs
[03:25] <SeLaB> MSch_, i would like to do everything which I use to on winxp
=== evil_ is now known as `Evil
[03:26] <lastnode> MSch_: im booting off a livecd, and i want to completely format /dev/hda. what is tne syntax?
[03:26] <MSch_> lastnode: i'd suggest using gparted, that's a graphical frontend
[03:26] <munzir> MSch_: I need to do this ls for each runlevel then I need to check my service in each output. e.g. to tell apache would start at runlevel 2 and 5 but not 3 and 1 there it's not convenient
[03:27] <lastnode> MSch_: but will it completely erase everything? including mbr? there are some bad blocks, so i want to wipe everything possible
[03:27] <MSch_> lastnode: then use dd
[03:27] <lastnode> MSch_: for a forty gig disk, how many sets of 1024 bytes would i need to send?
[03:28] <lastnode> (ive already used 1024 x 1000)

[03:29] <Evanescent> yay success
[03:29] <SeLaB> what is the paste bin site of ubuntu
[03:29] <lastnode> MSch_: ok thanks, that'll take a while, right?
[03:29] <lastnode> !paste
[03:29] <ubotu> see <!pastebin> please
[03:29] <lastnode> !pastebin
[03:29] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[03:29] <MSch_> lastnode: no, that would be bytes, sorry. 40 gigabytes = 41 943 040 kilobytes
[03:30] <lastnode> MSch_: count=42949672960 is correct, yes?
[03:30] <MSch_> MSch_: why don't you just omit count? afaik it should write till the end of the disk then?
[03:30] <munzir> MSch_: now I checked rc2.d I found K77ntp-server in red where the other links in cyan, does this means it's broken?
[03:30] <lastnode> MSch_: lol you talking to yourself? :p ok dude, doing that. thanks a lot :)
[03:32] <MSch_> munzir: it means that the link is linking to nowhere, so yes it's broken
[03:32] <gfxstyler> hi
[03:32] <enriquedf> anyone can help me? with a partition ? it does not work...
[03:32] <lastnode> hi gfxstyler
[03:32] <lastnode> enriquedf: "doesnt work" is not helpful. what is the error message?
[03:33] <gfxstyler> does someone here uses a fat32 partition to share data between win and linux?
[03:33] <munzir> MSch_: how can I tell which package generated it so I report it to launchpad?
[03:33] <enriquedf> well i tried to use partition magic and the utility partition of ubuntu but they dont want to apply the changes...
[03:33] <lastnode> gfxstyler: i used to. before i killed winblows
[03:33] <enriquedf> .... in partition magic it generates error 732...
[03:34] <gfxstyler> lastnode: could you execute applications from the fat32 partition in linux?
[03:34] <Evanescent> try fdisk
[03:34] <gfxstyler> because i get a "permission denied" when trying to do that (i have read-write support though)
[03:34] <MSch_> munzir: install apt-file it will tell you. but not every broken link means that the package has a problem, it may just be left over after you removed the package
[03:35] <munzir> MSch_: even so the post script should remove it, no?
[03:35] <enriquedf> mmm but it is strange that neither the utility partition of ubuntu resizes the old partition in order to get free space...
[03:36] <rohan> wow, automatix was taken out of arnieboy's hands ?
[03:36] <rohan> good :)
[03:37] <enriquedf> anyone has used partition magic?
[03:37] <gfxstyler> me
[03:37] <rohan> me too
[03:37] <`Evil> can someone help me please? i have a problem with apache2 and php files
[03:37] <gnomefreak> rohan: where did you see that?
[03:37] <MSch_> munzir: hm, i gues that's why there's a difference between purging packages and removing them. removing leaves the configuration intact, while purging deletes it
[03:37] <Evanescent> enriquedf: yes a long time ago... it's a pain
[03:37] <enriquedf> gfxstyler, rohan: do u know why do I get an error 732, and pm does not apply any changes on the partitions?
[03:38] <gfxstyler> i dunno
[03:38] <batman> hey anyone have any idea how i could possibly sym link the /home to a different hard drive to where it uses the other hard drives disc space?
[03:38] <enriquedf> evanescent: why is it a pain? hehe
[03:38] <MSch_> batman: just mount the drive as /home
[03:39] <rohan> gnomefreak: on a post
[03:39] <rohan> wait
[03:39] <Evanescent> because it would never let me do what i wanted, so i went back to basics and use fdisk
[03:39] <batman> MSch_ would i need to copy over the /home contents first?
[03:39] <rohan> gnomefreak: http://www.krazypenguin.net/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_6.06_Guide#Easily_install_additional_software
[03:39] <Evanescent> less hassle
[03:39] <MSch_> batman: yes
[03:39] <rohan> gnomefreak: from that site -- "Arnieboy will not be involved in the project at that time, but somebody else will."
[03:39] <gnomefreak> rohan: ty
[03:39] <rohan> gnomefreak: btw, plz change your nick to gnome_is_frek
[03:39] <rohan> lol
[03:39] <enriquedf> evanescent: do u know how to use fdisk in order to resize the disk and create a new partition?
[03:39] <rohan> *freak
[03:39] <rohan> :D
[03:40] <gnomefreak> lol
[03:40] <Evanescent> not possible to resize unfortunately
[03:40] <rohan> enriquedf: use gparted from the ubuntu live cd
[03:40] <rohan> enriquedf: fdisk will cause loss of data
[03:40] <Evanescent> that's what i was about to say
[03:41] <enriquedf> rohan: i tried to use gparted from the live cd but when i try to resized it, it doesnt want to apply the changes!.. so strange..
[03:41] <rohan> strange indeed ..
[03:42] <doped1> is it possible to change my character set to danish encoding from a gui? or should i search for dpkg's?
[03:42] <neogenesis> vh
[03:43] <Evanescent> enriquedf: what message do you get?
[03:44] <enriquedf> evanescent: it says applying changes.... and then it returns back to the same size!... i do not get error message with gparted
[03:45] <munzir> MSch_: ok in this case the link points to a file that sould be generated by ntp-server; dpkg -l ntp-server shows the package as 'un' which I guess means it's not installed. If it has been removed but have a config file remaining I think I would gave another status "C?" so I guess yes it's a bug
[03:45] <miranda82> enriquedf, use the official live cd of gparted
[03:45] <Corey> woohooo sucessfully instaled unbuntu :D !
[03:45] <doped1> :P
[03:45] <enriquedf> miranda82: where i can get it?
[03:45] <miranda82> from the website
[03:45] <Corey> alright now to install all the stuff again haha
[03:46] <miranda82> enriquedf, http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
[03:47] <doped1> how to change ubuntu charecter set?
[03:47] <haffe> doped1: In what meaning?
[03:48] <doped1> haffe: i'm from denmark, and i'd like the whole charecter set to be western instead of UTF8
[03:48] <haffe> Where?
[03:49] <haffe> I don't understand.
[03:49] <doped1> i'd hope i could change it in whole ubuntu
[03:49] <haffe> UTF-8 has support for all international characters.
[03:49] <doped1> i cant see danish chracters in file names and folderes..
[03:49] <Capozide> Can anybody help me with making a symbolic link?
[03:50] <bung> ln -s source dest

[03:50] <kane77> hi everybody...
[03:50] <haffe> doped1: Is it a mounted windows partition?
[03:51] <doped1> yes, :) how did u know..
[03:51] <haffe> Intuition.
[03:51] <haffe> :)
[03:51] <babo> where's a good place to store a subversion repository ... ?
[03:51] <doped1> and theres another problem on the drive too.. it wont show all the files.. some word files
[03:51] <kane77> how to have my windows partitions and disks mounted in such a way that I wouldn't need sudo to write to them.... (FAT of course)..
[03:51] <doped1> other word files is shows great
[03:51] <haffe> The problem is that windows uses ISO8859-1 as encoding, while ubuntu uses UTF-8.
[03:52] <haffe> The simplest method is to tell mount to use ISO8859-1 for the windows drives.
[03:52] <doped1> ok :P that why it says invalid encoding :)
[03:52] <doped1> yes, THAT's my problem then :)
[03:52] <silasj> hi
[03:52] <haffe> Yes, apparently.
[03:52] <doped1> haffe: can you help with that :P
[03:53] <haffe> Sure.
[03:53] <doped1> well, thanks
[03:53] <haffe> How much experience do you have with ubuntu?
[03:53] <haffe> Or linux at all.
[03:53] <doped1> it was automounted when i installed ubutnu..
[03:53] <Seantater> !flight7
[03:53] <ubotu> hmm... flight7 is available via http://www.ubuntu.com/testing, or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/flight-7/
[03:53] <doped1> not much, installe a little with apt-get and dpkg
[03:54] <haffe> doped1: Are you using Ubuntu or kubuntu?
[03:54] <doped1> ubuntu
[03:54] <haffe> Ok.
[03:54] <haffe> Just a minute, I will switch to my gnomemachine.
[03:54] <doped1> :) thanks!
[03:55] <enriquedf> miranda82: i have downloaded it ... now, if i want to execute it?
[03:56] <_mason> Quick Question, does ubuntu come with its own firewall & if so, how do i open a port?
[03:56] <kane77> how to have my windows partitions and disks mounted in such a way that I wouldn't need sudo to write to them.... (FAT of course)..
[03:56] <edulix> hi !
[03:56] <davidhouse> which packages do i need to play m4as in kaffeine?
[03:56] <Capozide> Can anybody help me privately, I'm having a little bit of a complexed problem
[03:57] <edulix> I want to connect to a windows pc and execute an app there
[03:57] <doped1> haffe: are you there.. im gonna quit for 5 minutes, and come back!, backing up the files on the drive, and formating it to FAT for better visa versa read-write result from both windows and ubuntu
[03:57] <Tsingi> any ubuntu nis experts?
[03:57] <Subhuman> kane77, open a terminal , type "sudo nano /etc/fstab" look for the lines with "vfat" in them, and then where it says "defaults" make it "defaults,rw"
[03:58] <haffe_> Ok, I'm back.
[03:58] <doped1> yes..
[03:58] <doped1> ok.. well 2 sek
[03:58] <haffe_> Start a terminal.
[03:58] <doped1> haffe: im gonna quit for 5 minutes, and come back!, backing up the files on the drive, and formating it to FAT for better visa versa read-write result from both windows and ubuntu
[03:58] <edulix> the thing is I need to use some windows app that I  haven't been able to use with wine. what I want to do is to execute it remotely in my mom's pc, without bothering her of course
[03:59] <kane77> Subhuman and is there any way to write to NTFS??
[03:59] <edulix> so vnc probably wouldn't make it, what else could I use?
[03:59] <doped1> haffe_: i'll be back in 5 min
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[04:00] <ompaul> doped1, we know, go and come back
[04:00] <Subhuman> kane77, umm yes, but itz not 100%
[04:00] <doped1> ok
[04:00] <Subhuman> !captive
[04:00] <ubotu> well, captive is a project to use windows NTFS drivers under linux. It does not work properly with Ubuntu.
[04:00] <GaiaX11> which is the best firewall for ubuntu? Lokkit?
[04:00] <Subhuman> oh Kane77, looks like captive doesnt work with ubuntu.
[04:01] <Subhuman> GaiaX11, firestarter is my fav.

[04:08] <Madmerc> hello room :D
[04:09] <Tsingi> http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/net/nis states that NIS requires debconf >= 0.5.00 however debconf is currently at 1.4.72.
[04:09] <Tsingi> It's been my experience that when I start installing stuff that isn't in the package manager, I break ubuntu, so should I drop ubuntu and install debian to get NIS?  Or is it safe?
[04:09] <doped1> haffe_,  i'm back
[04:09] <Madmerc> is there anyone here who knows about this ubuntu linux ???
[04:09] <ompaul> Tsingi, dapper is in the channel #ubuntu+1
[04:09] <davidhouse> which packages do i need to play m4as in kaffeine?
[04:09] <Tsingi> ompaul: thanks
[04:09] <Corey> how do i make myself an admin
[04:10] <ompaul> Madmerc, help.ubuntu.com and docs.ubuntu.com are a good place to start, unless you have a specific question
[04:10] <Capozide> Can anybody help me with symbolic links?
[04:10] <ompaul> Corey, read that root page again
[04:10] <gnomefreak> !symlinks
[04:10] <ubotu> I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, gnomefreak
[04:10] <Madmerc> should i upgrade my copy of ubuntu from warty warthog ???
[04:10] <Capozide> Not just the syntax, I need help from a person
[04:10] <gnomefreak> Madmerc: yes to hoary than to breezy
[04:10] <MSch_> Capozide: ln -s Target Link
[04:11] <theverant> how can I check if Ubuntu is using both my CPUs?
[04:11] <Capozide> Arrgh, I know the syntax
[04:11] <theverant> is there a command that displays CPU info?
[04:11] <Madmerc> could i just download the breezy iso and install it fresh ???
[04:11] <gnomefreak> theverant: maybe top?
[04:11] <Capozide> I need help with GCC
[04:11] <MSch_> Capozide: what's your exact problem? (sorry for restating the arguments)
[04:11] <gnomefreak> Madmerc: yes
[04:11] <haffe__> theverant: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[04:11] <Madmerc> ok thanx guys
[04:11] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn Thanks for all the help Re: routing
[04:11] <doped1> haffe
[04:11] <doped1> :P
[04:12] <haffe__> doped1: Yes ?
[04:12] <ompaul> Madmerc, the "approved route" to do that is to take two hops one via hoary and the next via breezy to get to dapper next month, warty has no support since 1 month ago, I suggest you actually download the install for 5.10 or Dapper (the almost finished beta) and start from there
[04:12] <doped1> yes.. the mount problem
[04:12] <haffe__> Yes.
[04:12] <haffe__> Start a terminal.
[04:12] <doped1> haffe__,  done
[04:12] <Corey> I keep getting this error when i install stuff unable to lock the administration directory
[04:12] <haffe__> type sudo nano /etc/fstab
[04:12] <Evanescent> heh i'm exploring and just found khangman "for children 6 and above"... that's about my level... lol
[04:12] <ompaul> Corey, sudo apt-get isntall WHATEVER
[04:12] <ubuntu> hey
[04:12] <theverant> haffe__ it shows CPU 0 only... shouldn't it list two seperately?  It sees CPU 0 as an X2 though...
[04:12] <Madmerc> oh one more thing ... my synaptic package manager doesnt seem to find any updates for the packages is that because there are none or is it just not working ???
[04:13] <doped1> haffe__,  done
[04:13] <gnomefreak> Corey: do you have another apt process running such as synaptic or apt-get update or an update manager?
[04:13] <Corey> yes actually
[04:13] <haffe__> doped1: Do you see the line relating to your windows partion?
[04:13] <ubuntu> i looking for this option  in the installer option for filesystem as "do not use the partition". for do i find it
[04:13] <Corey> thanks that helped
[04:13] <Capozide> Well I want to change the symbolic link in my /usr/bin/ from GCC 4.0 to GCC 3.4
[04:13] <doped1> haffe__,  after i converted the ntfs, to fat, when i booted ubuntu, i could't mount the drive becouse it wasnt htfs anymore
[04:13] <gnomefreak> Madmerc: i think it has to do with support being stopped on warty
[04:14] <doped1> haffe__, yes i see the partitions were fixing :P
[04:14] <Madmerc> oh ok well thats good news thanx i wasnt sure if my internet was working properly :P
[04:14] <gnomefreak> Capozide: theres an export command to make that simple
[04:14] <haffe__> First thing, change ntfs to vfat
[04:14] <Capozide> Because I get errors compiling a certain program in GCC 4.0, but it's supposed to work in GCC 3.4
[04:14] <doped1> haffe__ ok
[04:14] <MSch_> Capozide: what about update-alternatives?
[04:14] <gnomefreak> Capozide: first install gcc-3.4
[04:15] <gnomefreak> MSch_: its not there
[04:15] <Capozide> I've already installed GCC 3.4
[04:15] <doped1> haffe__, done
[04:15] <Corey> im glad I have fast inerenet :D
[04:15] <autosuggested> Anyone here familiar with NFS and using it with iptables?
[04:15] <gnomefreak> ompaul: what teh export command for gcc?
[04:15] <Corey> I had to delete my windows partion ! :( !
[04:15] <haffe__> doped1: After you've done that you should see a line saying something like user,ro
[04:15] <gnomefreak> isnt it exportCC=3.4?
[04:15] <Madmerc> ok guys well thanx for ur help ttyl
[04:15] <haffe__> append NLS=iso8859-1 to that line.
[04:15] <disinterseted_pe> im getting an error on mplayer: it says new_face failed. maybe the font path is wrong. please supply the font file (~/. mplayer/subfont.ttf). where do i find this

[04:16] <haffe__> doped1: Ok, append the following ,user,NLS=ISO8859-1
[04:17] <gnomefreak> johannes_erik: have you been using ubuntu for a while?

[04:17] <theverant> anyone know how I can adjust how ubuntu is using the CPU?
[04:17] <anndy> i am using ubuntu 5.10
[04:17] <MSch_> Capozide: it's cc and not gcc isn't it?
[04:17] <johannes_erik> gnomefreek yes good few years although a slackware fan at heart :p
[04:17] <gnomefreak> stefkeh: dvd iso or cd iso
[04:17] <stefkeh> cd iso
[04:17] <Capozide> Yes
[04:17] <Capozide> No, it's GCC
[04:17] <PJFitzgibbons> johannes: depends on what your'e going to do. I've just tried Dapper a few different ways and need to stick with Hoary for now.. .dev tools are not totally synced in dapper yet.
[04:17] <Capozide> Do I need to install CC?
[04:17] <gnomefreak> johannes_erik: you should be ok with dapper
[04:17] <anndy> and i wanna connect motorola L7 to my PC so that i can use internet on my PC

[04:18] <gnomefreak> Capozide: no
[04:18] <h3sp4wn> johsnnes_erik: Is the routing working ok now ?
[04:18] <doped1> haffe__,  done, should i tab the rest so it matches the "line"
[04:18] <haffe__> theverant: What is it you want to do?
[04:18] <Capozide> It says
[04:18] <haffe__> doped1: No.
[04:18] <johannes_erik> ok , i was just checking , i havent kept up to date with the builds and was sure if it was stable enough for general use yet
[04:18] <Capozide> There is only 1 program which provides cc.
[04:18] <anndy> cell is GPRS enabled and i got service also active from my service provider
[04:18] <johannes_erik> thanks gnomefreek :)

[04:18] <theverant> haffe__ I want it to see both cores... it's also showing the one core at 1GHz, and it should be 2
[04:18] <MSch_> Capozide: even though you've installed both GCC versions?

[04:18] <Capozide> Yes
[04:19] <doped1> haffe__,  ok, i want the other windows partition to be iso8859-1 too, should i use same option
[04:19] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn yes sorted problem , seems i currupted the iptable at some point :S. it wouldnt write changes to it , i reinstalled ubuntu and all good now
[04:19] <MSch_> Capozide: why don't you just change the symlink for gcc?
[04:19] <Capozide> That's what I need help with in the first place
[04:19] <Capozide> I don't know how to do that
[04:19] <johannes_erik> h3sp4wn thanks for the help though the way u suggested was far easier! :)
[04:20] <ubuntu> can someone help me i am  looking for this option  in the installer option for filesystem as "do not use the partition". where to find the option after typeing server at prompt

[04:30] <_mason> I cant get mine to connect and i have all the ports setup, i cant figure out whats wrong, does ubuntu have its own firewall  that i need to open some ports in?

[05:03] <Corey> arm..... can wine run dreamweaver 8 ?
[05:03] <CrippsFX> is anybody running the native broadcom driver in x86_64?
[05:03] <Ng> Iam8up|lpy: you probably want to specify something like -o uid=YOURUIDHERE (you can find out your uid with "id" in a terminal). see "man mount"'s ntfs section for more details
[05:03] <Iam8up|lpy> i thought there was a -U option that would allow me to switch UIDs, so i tried mount -t ntfs -U 1000 /dev/hda1 /mountpoint
[05:03] <CrippsFX> ... or xgl in x86_74? ;)
[05:03] <Dr_Willis> !ntfs
[05:03] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.

[05:05] <Jeff1983> i purchased some tv shows on dvd. i'd like to rip the commentary tracks only (i.e. no video) is there a way to do this?
[05:05] <gnomefreak> Corey: sudo dpkg -i file.deb
[05:05] <CrippsFX> oh yeah, sudo ... I forgot that part about ubuntu ;)
[05:05] <aLPHa_LeaK> <Corey>	arm..... can wine run dreamweaver 8 ? << there are linux alternatives to it
[05:05] <gnomefreak> lerch: sudo apt-get -f install    (thats all you type dont add a package to it)
[05:05] <Corey> oh really are they as graphically pleasing and good working as dreamweaer ?
[05:06] <gnomefreak> Corey: nvu and bluefish are the best IMHO (closet to dreamweaver i have found)
[05:06] <lerch> gnomefreak: what does that do? I think I may have a broken package in that lilypond thing, but I've used Synaptic's fix broken packages function several times
[05:06] <Tuzlo> CrippsFX: sudo isnt ubuntu secific. specially if you dont su to root
[05:07] <johannes_erik> corey dont be so doubtful about opensource software , most of the time its better wroking and has more features!
[05:07] <Corey> yeah I know that im just saying is it good ?
[05:07] <gnomefreak> lerch: that will fix broken packages  (i dont trust synaptic version
[05:07] <CrippsFX> Tuzlo:~ yeah, but ootb it is default behaviour, which is what I was pointing out. :)
[05:07] <Corey> cause im very used to phtooshop and dreamweaver
[05:07] <Subhuman> Corey, nvu is very good.
[05:07] <lerch> gnomefreak: ok, thanks
[05:08] <Subhuman> Corey, for photoshop, i suggest you get "gimpSHOP" a gimp hack to make it look like PS
[05:08] <Subhuman> !gimpshop
[05:08] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Subhuman
[05:08] <johannes_erik> corey : generaly try and avoid windows binarys , wine may work but it wont be 100% solution
[05:08] <lsuactiafner> i have a window that extends past the bottem of my desktop, so i cant apply the settings. i used alt to move the window as far up as possible but the top part of the screen is like a hard border, how do i fix this?
[05:08] <topyli> Corey: photoshop and dreamweaver are windows software. if you really want to use them, you should run an operating system they run on. otherwise you better find linux programs :)
[05:09] <Corey> lol ok
[05:09] <firepol> hi, ive just upgraded to dapper. openoffice was removed, im trying to install it but i get a dependency error. can someone help ?
[05:09] <rubso> corey: i use The GIMP in Linux and Windows, its really cool and easy-to-use if you are a photoshop pro ;)
[05:09] <Ng> firepol: dapper questions in #ubuntu+1 please
[05:09] <Corey> yeah im a ps pro ive heard about gimpshop
[05:09] <carlos> Yannig: it works here
[05:09] <firepol> thanks Ng
[05:09] <lerch> gnomefreak: I get the excact same error message when running that command. It complaint's about the package either being not fully installed or removed.
[05:09] <Corey> which im going to install shortly
[05:10] <gnomefreak> lerch: no package name just sudo apt-get -f install
[05:10] <rubso> Corey: you could get rid of gimpshop, The GIMP regular interface is good :)
[05:10] <carlos> Yannig: I did some checks and it should work for you too. The only explanation I could give you is that you forgot to install the language packs for French
[05:10] <lerch> gnomefreak: yes, that's what I did
[05:10] <CrippsFX> Is ubuntu 6 out yet?
[05:10] <Ng> no
[05:10] <rubso> no
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> !dapper

[05:10] <CrippsFX> dang.
[05:10] <lerch> gnomefreak: It's complaining when calculating dependencies
[05:10] <gnomefreak> lerch: try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgfrade
[05:10] <CrippsFX> kk.
[05:10] <Tuzlo> minus the f

[05:11] <ziomal82> Hi !
[05:11] <makelele> does anyone know of a comman line torrent package
[05:11] <ziomal82> Is there something like system restore preinstalled in ubuntu? Thanks in advance for the info
[05:11] <disu> someone have never used vmaware?
[05:11] <lerch> gnomefreak: ok, I'll try that
[05:11] <Ng> makelele: bittorrent or bittornado
[05:11] <rubso> gnomefreak, i guess you should do pre-upgrading things, look for it in Ubuntu Wiki.
[05:11] <Ng> makelele: both include a "headless" interface
[05:11] <gnomefreak> rubso: huh?
[05:11] <chris_> I'm trying to set up a second screen with my laptop with xinerama. First I just want the desktop screen to show at the correct resolution, but it's just showing at the same resolution as the laptop. Any ideas why? My xorg.conf is here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14473
[05:11] <CrippsFX> rubso:~ should be no problem to update from testing to stable eh? Just change the paths in apt.conf, apt-get update;apt-get upgrade;   .... right?
[05:11] <johannes_erik> disu : what was the question ?
[05:11] <carlos> Yannig: I guess you didn't create the French locale by hand, right? Ubuntu created it for you when you installed the French language packs....
[05:12] <gnomefreak> rubso: hes not upgrading distros
[05:12] <rubso> oh!
[05:12] <h3sp4wn> makelele: rtorrent is the best command line interface IMO
[05:12] <lerch> gnomefreak: same errormessage, but now it asks "continue? [y/n] "
[05:12] <Yannig> carlos> You're right
[05:12] <gnomefreak> rubso: dist-upgrade (with same repos will grab kernels and stuff
[05:12] <gnomefreak> lerch: y
[05:12] <CrippsFX> well ... sorry. what I mean is use dapper for now, and when it gets to stable, stick with it.
[05:12] <disu> i,m usinf vmaware and i have some problem with the network....my dns changes automayically and in the wrong way
[05:12] <disu> i change it
[05:13] <Corey> is there a beta vesion of linux flash player 8.5 ?
[05:13] <rubso> gnomefreak, what repos you're using for upgrade?
[05:13] <disu> but after some times it changes again
[05:13] <rubso> Corey: no.
[05:13] <gnomefreak> rubso: im not upgrading
[05:13] <Corey> I heard there is

[05:13] <gnomefreak> rubso: are you trying to upgrade to dapper?
[05:13] <rubso> Corey: i believe Adobe said they'll be releasing the new Flash Player for Linux, this september i believe.
[05:13] <johannes_erik> disu i had loads of network problems with vmware but never used long enough to mertit finding a solution . someone here possibly knows

[05:14] <Corey> f@w\<s i have uni tommorow and its 1 in the momrning
[05:14] <rubso> gnomefreak: no i'm not i'm just wondering about the sources "repos" you use for upgrading since its not included in apt-get/synaptic.
[05:14] <Corey> awseome
[05:14] <Ng> disu: is the interface configured with dhcp?
[05:14] <Corey> good to hear
[05:14] <Yannig> I set them for reinstallation, it may work...
[05:14] <Ng> disu: if so it's probably that which is changing your DNS details
[05:14] <disu> yes
[05:14] <Corey> this is my first day on linux :D
[05:14] <killercacti> I just installed Kubuntu... can anyone recommend a good app that I can download that acts as a panel to show my up/down speeds and all that other good sysinfo?

[05:14] <carlos> Yannig: please, send me by email the output of the following commands:
[05:14] <rubso> Corey: lol, have fun, Ubuntu is really great ;)
[05:14] <Corey> yeah its been great

[05:15] <CrippsFX> ... well ... it's not my first day ... I mean the "linux users club"
[05:15] <CrippsFX> :)
[05:15] <Corey> Yeah its good so far :)
[05:15] <Corey> I can watch my porn im happy :D
[05:15] <gnomefreak> rubso: dist-upgrade does not upgrade you to newest distro
=== carthik_zzz is now known as carthik
[05:15] <Corey> but
[05:15] <disu> i modify the dns width network-admin and it works for some minutes
[05:15] <disu> after it changes
[05:15] <johannes_erik> disu you may want to change it , reboot change it reboot , that may work?
[05:15] <rubso> gnomefreak: i believe it upgrades packages only?
[05:15] <Ng> johannes_erik: you don't need to reboot to change DNS details. I think we've already established that it's almost certainly DHCP that's to blame
[05:15] <gnomefreak> rubso: dist-upgrade updates all packages including kernels
[05:15] <disu> reboot-change-reboot?
[05:15] <carlos> Yannig: 'strace ls --help' <- This one will produce a lot of messages, redirect it to a file: 'strace ls --help 1> strace-output.txt 2>&1'
[05:16] <rubso> gnomefreak: yeah ;)
[05:16] <Corey> Im still trying to adjust to how bright everything is
[05:16] <Corey> its sorta hard on the eyes
[05:16] <devie> is there an alternative to Gaim?
[05:16] <carlos> Yannig: that will allow me to trace the problem
[05:16] <johannes_erik> Ng in a couple of blogs ive read issues with ubuntu and vmware , i cant verify this as a solution but its turned up on a few occasions as a solution
[05:16] <gnomefreak> devie: for what chat client?
[05:16] <Ng> johannes_erik: I almost always call shenanigans on solutions that involve rebooting ;)
[05:17] <rubso> Corey: i'm using an old laptop, :p the screen is sooooo bright !!
[05:17] <devie> gnomefreak: AIM and MSN
[05:17] <disu> i'll try....i let you know
[05:17] <killercacti> I know there are apps that pull info from top and make it look nice as a sidebar :P
[05:17] <Corey> I know im using a laptop
[05:17] <gnomefreak> devie: amsn for msn and there really isnt one for aim naim but its text only
[05:17] <Corey> and its hard to adjust to the brightness of everything
[05:17] <johannes_erik> Ng hehe very true , as i say i have no way to verify but its what ive heard :)
[05:17] <Ng> killercacti: gdesklets and gkrellm most likely
[05:17] <rubso> devie: try downloading kopete ;) it behaves like a real MSN Messenger.
[05:17] <CrippsFX> Ng:~ I wholeheartedly agree with you there ... unless it's a kernel upgrade.
[05:17] <Corey> i dont like amsn gaim was a bit better haha
[05:18] <DrBanzai> Anybody her have the link for the new "official" extras CD?
[05:18] <rubso> Corey: indeed. !
[05:18] <devie> gnomefreak: I'd just use centericq for text only
[05:18] <Yannig> carlos> It seems the last command does not work: it give me a ">" without creating any file
[05:18] <gnomefreak> gaim is the only multi client chat app in ubuntu ( you can try trillian but dont know if it works ing ubuntu)
[05:18] <ctothej> how do i automatically type to a person ("username:") in polaris x mirc script?
[05:18] <Yannig> (ups, forget it :()
[05:18] <gnomefreak> DrBanzai: define extra cds?
[05:18] <Corey> wewt wooo amarok installed and working with my 50GB hardrive of music <3
[05:19] <devie> ruboso:installing kopete, thanks for the tip
[05:19] <gnomefreak> DrBanzai: everything is included on one cd (more if you change your repos)
[05:19] <killercacti> Ng: I removed gnome earlier and installed kubuntu-desktop... would I still be able to use those?
[05:19] <DrBanzai> gnomefreak, Its the CD that sets up MP3 playback, and gives you extra fonts, and stuff like that...
[05:19] <gnomefreak> DrBanzai: they are repos
[05:19] <rubso> Corey: i like amarok, its really cool and much better than my windows mp3 player :P i wish they'll port it there !
[05:19] <gil_> can someone help me with remote desktop
[05:19] <gil_> ?
[05:19] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell DrBanzai -about restricted
[05:19] <gil_> how do i set specific usernames....
[05:19] <gnomefreak> DrBanzai: please read the pm ubotu sent you
[05:20] <Corey> haha, i like winamp a bit better
[05:20] <Corey> ubuntu is so much faster than windows !
[05:20] <lerch> gnomefreak: I pasted the result in the pastebin now
[05:20] <DrBanzai> gnomefreak, Ok, well, that's not what I had in mind, but should work just as well...
[05:20] <rubso> killeracti: why don't you log into kde website, and get KDE Ubuntu Packages, or try the wiki.
[05:20] <edulix> Corey: depends what do you compare :P
[05:20] <carlos> Yannig: it works here... you should paste it exactly as I gave you it, without any extra spaces between the number and the '>' char: 2>
[05:20] <Yannig> carlos> Sent :)
[05:20] <rubso> Corey: it depends, but Ubuntu is really rooooollling soo fast on my old laptop :P
[05:20] <devie> kopete looks a little nicer than Gaim
[05:20] <devie> thanks
[05:21] <carlos> Yannig: ok, thanks
[05:21] <johannes_erik> corey in terms of less rubbish padding out an os yes it is faster :D
[05:21] <rubso> devie: i believe so ;)
[05:21] <carlos> will tell you something when I look at it, I need to finish something else first
[05:21] <devie> I got spoiled by Adium on OS X
[05:21] <disinterseted_pe> how do i install mplayer plug in from the desktop
[05:21] <killercacti> rubso: that sounds like a good idea... I'm really overwhelmed by the billions of packages available, not sure what is good to use. I haven't used X in about 6 years, really only been on FBSD cli until this morning
[05:22] <Corey> i jsut installed 3ddesktop
[05:22] <rubso> disinterseted_pe: try Synaptic and search for the plugins you need.
[05:22] <Corey> how do i use it haha

[05:31] <disu> someone can help me?

[05:38] <krang> rubso: I was thinking of using a bootable CD to delete /etc/shadow and seeing if that reset passwords. Or would that likely break everything?

[05:41] <rubso> krang: oh that's bad, i've tried "adduser" in terminal , and it requires root permissions, you told me that you don't know your root pass, right?

[06:10] <NoUse> Rubin it just creates an oem user and then when you package the PC you run a command and the next time the PC boots it asks for lanugage options, and creates a new user
[06:10] <NoUse> Rubin there is a page describing it in detail on the wiki
[06:11] <Rubin> i just searched the wiki, if its there its not findable by 'oem mode'
[06:11] <the_mug> NoUse: any idea how to clear my install queue for apt?

[06:43] <buzzed> a little over half way on the volume control
[06:43] <disinterseted_pe> there is no permissions tab
[06:43] <NoUse> buzzed is that main or PCM?
[06:44] <disinterseted_pe> ive got move to trash lol
[06:44] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe right click on a file then click properties , near bottom and then in the window that opens there should be permissions ?
[06:44] <buzzed> oh, they are all about halfway... Master, Headphone, PCM
[06:44] <disinterseted_pe> yep permissions is grey
[06:45] <johannes_erik> thats odd u should be in root , u used the window that opened from the terminal command ??
[06:45] <disinterseted_pe> yep with sudo nautilus
[06:46] <NoUse> buzzed static could be the sound levels overloading, I'd try playing with volume levels
[06:46] <buzzed> thx
[06:46] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe in that tab who is the file owner , says near the top
[06:47] <buzzed> what is PCM?
[06:47] <disinterseted_pe> under the permissions tab?
[06:48] <disinterseted_pe> file owner root
[06:48] <NoUse> buzzed pretty much all your sound, wav,mp3,ogg all go through PCM
[06:49] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe thats really odd , that first thing u did in the terminal should have made u root user :S lol
[06:49] <disinterseted_pe> idk
[06:50] <johannes_erik> ok bak to basics lmao close all that and open a new terminal window
[06:50] <disinterseted_pe> ok open
[06:51] <johannes_erik>  sudo mv /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/* /home
[06:51] <johannes_erik> but replace * with each file name
[06:52] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe  : filename of each totem plugin file that is :D
[06:53] <bratsche> If I'm using an Athlon64 in 32-bit mode, should I be using linux-386 or linux-686?
[06:53] <NoUse> bratsche 686
[06:53] <Samuli^> in 32-bit mode 386
[06:54] <NoUse> bratsche oh, nevermind my response
[06:54] <Seantater> How do I remove a filesystem from a floppy, so I can put grub on it?
[06:54] <NoUse> Seantater if you run the grub setup it will overwrite the floppy
[06:54] <Seantater> okay -- how do I do that then?
[06:54] <disinterseted_pe> ok erik nothing came up with that string
[06:54] <bratsche> There is a linux-headers-k7, but there is no linux-k7 package.  That's sort of confusing.
[06:54] <disinterseted_pe> just my pw
[06:55] <pkern> Hi, does http://ftp-master.debian.org/rene-daily.txt work in your Gecko browser of choice? Both Firefox and Epiphany keep crashing X here on current Dapper. |:
[06:55] <NoUse> Seantater https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto/BootFloppy
[06:55] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe nothing should if u ran with replacing * with each totem plugin filename it will move them into ur home folder
[06:55] <Seantater> okay -- thyanks
[06:55] <orbin> Seantater: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto/BootFloppy
[06:55] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[06:55] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe it asks ur password for security
[06:56] <disinterseted_pe> so now what do i do
[06:56] <FOAD> Give up and cry?
[06:56] <johannes_erik> u run that command for all files with totem in the name?
[06:56] <johannes_erik> FOAD thats with M$ windows user approach :p
[06:57] <krang> Anyone know how I can tell which device the directory I am currently in resides on?
[06:57] <disinterseted_pe> the first command after reopening terminal?
[06:57] <pkern> Anyone on current Dapper who could try a URL in Firefox?
[06:57] <bratsche> Yes.
[06:57] <krang> pkern: me
[06:57] <bratsche> What's the url?
[06:58] <krang> oh, bratsche's on it
[06:58] <pkern> krang: http://ftp-master.debian.org/rene-daily.txt
[06:58] <nonnii> pkern, worked on firefox and fluxbox
[06:58] <johannes_erik>  sudo mv /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins/* /home  <that one but instead of * u should put the file name of the totem files in that folder
[06:58] <pkern> nonnii: ):
[06:59] <bratsche> Uhh.
[06:59] <bratsche> pkern, was that supposed to crash my whole system?
[06:59] <disinterseted_pe> oh crap
[06:59] <pkern> bratsche: X crash?
[06:59] <pkern> bratsche: Well...
[06:59] <krang> oh wait, that box has no network cable today
[06:59] <bratsche> Yeah.
[06:59] <bratsche> X, not system.
[06:59] <bratsche> But it might as well be the same thing. :)
[06:59] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe lol forgot to change the * ?
[06:59] <pkern> bratsche: Depends on the browser... I got X crash with Firefox and system crash with Epiphany.
[06:59] <disinterseted_pe> yep
[06:59] <bratsche> Wow.
[06:59] <pkern> bratsche: Well, I warned on the first message. ;)
[06:59] <JoshRA> How can i reinstall the ubuntu bootloader?
[06:59] <bratsche> pkern, hit me with that URL again. I'm Windows now.
[07:00] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe its ok dont worry
[07:00] <ryanakca> I tried building a package from source.... but since I recently switched to gnome, I have a whole set of libraries to install... which ones to  I install to correct: http://pastebin.com/731344
[07:00] <pkern> bratsche: But system crash probably resulting from X crash.
[07:00] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:00] <disinterseted_pe> idk each file name
[07:00] <johannes_erik> go to place top menu then home
[07:00] <pkern> bratsche: http://ftp-master.debian.org/rene-daily.txt -- It works on wget just fine... didn't see something obvious.
[07:00] <orbin> JoshRA: as in grub? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[07:00] <bratsche> I'm IN Windows now I mean. :)
[07:00] <erUSUL> JoshRA: grub-install /dev/hdx (or /dev/sdx)
[07:00] <JoshRA> orbin: yea the harddrive with windows on it has failing
[07:00] <disinterseted_pe> hey atleast i can surf the web lol
[07:00] <JoshRA> with contains the mbr
[07:01] <disinterseted_pe> ok im there
[07:01] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe then do sudo mv /home/* /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins   < change the * for each plugin fil (except the totem ones) that u find in ur home folder
[07:02] <Mysta_> when removing packages from synaptic, what is the difference between "Mark for Removal" or "Mark for Complete Removal"?  Does the latter remove the install and all files????
[07:02] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe by leaving the * it moved the whole contents of the folder hehe
[07:02] <bratsche> pkern, That's pretty weird though.  Do you know what is causing that?
[07:02] <pkern> bratsche: Nope, and I didn't yet try to trace the X crash.
[07:02] <rafal_> hello, I deletes garbage from pulpit :( - where can I get him back?

[07:16] <ubuntu> :)
[07:16] <Yanlowen> I have ubuntu daul booting with windows xp, I am trying to get the XP drive mounted, so I can use the applications on it thru wine.
[07:16] <Subhuman> MikeW, the packages are in dapper
[07:16] <gnomefreak> MikeW: only in dapper
[07:16] <Flannel> MikeW: yep.  Edgy should have it.  Breezy has it unofficially.
[07:16] <Flannel> MikeW: erm, Dapper has it unofficially.
[07:16] <ubuntu> in wich cantri yuo are?

[07:16] <tanek> hi, just installed ubuntu on my laptop, and the touchpad is really (and i mean REALLY) sensitive for movement. on the other hand its not very sensitive at all for clicking :S know issue?
[07:16] <slackern> rafal_: rightclick on a panel and select "Add to Panel" and you will find it there again.
[07:16] <Pyru> what should I uncomment in sources.list so I can update my linux installation
[07:17] <MikeW> hmm, in that case I'll wait for Edgy to have it stabily
[07:17] <gnomefreak> ubuntu: for offtopic conversation please join #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:17] <disinterseted_pe> did u mean cd then the /usr/lib sturff?
[07:17] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe did u copy and paste it into the terminal ?
[07:17] <sangenfant> Yanlowen: AFAIK there's not much able to be done with an NTFS partition as of right now.
[07:17] <disinterseted_pe> no
[07:17] <rafal_> THANKS ;)
[07:17] <disinterseted_pe> should i
[07:17] <slackern> rafal_: Your welcome.
[07:17] <Flannel> MikeW: it's fairly stable in Dapper, and if you do it unobtrusively, if it goes south you can just comment out some stuff and be back to normal.
[07:17] <mnk> hi all - is there a gui that just installs a webcam? my webcam used to work when i installed ubuntu [by itself]  and then after i installed some apps, it just stopped working. Now how can i rerun like a hardware detection wizard or something that will redo what the installer did and find the camera and install it?
[07:17] <sangenfant> Yanlowen: between linux and ntfs
[07:17] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe it might be a missing slah :)
[07:17] <ubuntu> ka jus cia snekat?
[07:17] <gnomefreak> Pyru: all lines starting with the word deb EXCEPT the deb cdrom you need to add a # to that
[07:17] <disinterseted_pe> ok i'll copy and paste
[07:17] <Subhuman> Yanlowen, you can mount it, but read only, no write.
[07:17] <ubuntu> file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html
[07:18] <MikeW> Flannel: that's the point. I don't want to have to comment out anything.
[07:18] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe  command prompt is not much fun 8-))
[07:18] <ubuntu> fuck
[07:18] <Yanlowen> Can I install the application to the the filesystem of ubuntu and run it from there?
[07:18] <ubuntu> yuo
[07:18] <ubuntu> all
[07:18] <ubuntu> :)))))))0
[07:18] <disinterseted_pe> it wont copy and paste
[07:19] <Pyru> gnomefreak, this line #deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386
[07:19] <gnomefreak> disinterseted_pe: ise pastebin to paste
[07:19] <gnomefreak> Pyru: leave a 3 infornt of that one or put one there if not already
[07:19] <krang> Yanlowen: I should think so. did you install ubuntu yet or are you using a live cd?
[07:19] <gnomefreak> leave the #
[07:19] <gnomefreak> s/3/#
[07:20] <mnk> any help would be appreciated pls :)
[07:20] <Yanlowen> Installed, but what I am getting is that the appication is on the C: drive, but no C: exists.
[07:20] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ok it should work typing  " cd /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins " no " obviously :))
[07:20] <disinterseted_pe> i hilited it and rt clicked and no paste bin either
[07:20] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell mnk about webcam
[07:20] <johannes_erik> make sure u have the / before the usr bit
[07:20] <mnk> thanks gnomefreak :)
[07:21] <Yanlowen> So the application is installed under Ubuntu biut I can't find the root dir to run the Executable thru wine
[07:21] <gnomefreak> Yanlowen: linux doesnt name drives like that
[07:21] <krang> Yanlowen: um, how did you get a C: drive at all? I don't think linux has those
[07:21] <Pyru> gnomefreak, so it should look like this? s/3/#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)] / breezy main restricted
[07:21] <gnomefreak> Pyru: no just the #
[07:21] <Pyru> im new to linux, so im sorry
[07:21] <disinterseted_pe> do i add the no?
[07:21] <gnomefreak> Pyru: #deb cdrom: should be the beginning of it
[07:22] <johannes_erik> nope just                                      cd /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[07:22] <disinterseted_pe> ok here i go enter
[07:22] <disinterseted_pe> no such file or directory
[07:22] <Yanlowen> well I must depart, guess I can work on this later
[07:23] <Yanlowen> thanks for the advice so far
[07:23] <disinterseted_pe> cd isnt supposed to be a separate entry?
[07:23] <johannes_erik> type exactly from here      cd /usr
[07:23] <gnomefreak> disinterseted_pe: cd /usr/lib/blah/blah that lets you change directories to the path you give
[07:24] <gnomefreak> disinterseted_pe: cd by itself will put you back to your home dir.
[07:24] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:24] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe lol its quite hard to explain but its like gnomefreak said
[07:24] <johannes_erik> i think it was the same with DOS :S cant mind
[07:25] <disinterseted_pe> it came up but i cant see what it says im at the bottom of the page
[07:25] <gnomefreak> johannes_erik: yes cd does the same in dos
[07:25] <Aeudian> If i install say bind9, postfix, ispconfig, apache, and i reboot the server, will these services automaticly restart do do i need to manually restart them>?
[07:25] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe anyway lol try   cd /usr
[07:25] <Flannel> Aeudian: if you reboot the server (server being the whole computer?) then yes.  And, you can restart them manually if you want as well.
[07:25] <johannes_erik> gnomefreak , ok i barely mind DOS lol im too young for that stuff
[07:26] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:26] <disinterseted_pe> done
[07:26] <gnomefreak> lol johannes_erik its still used in windows
[07:26] <Pyru> thanks gnomefreak :)
[07:26] <Pyru> 164 updates found!
[07:26] <Pyru> hehe
[07:26] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe i tells ya what directory ur in on the left of the blinking cursor
[07:26] <Aeudian> Flannel: thanks just making sure cause i know when i reboot my server i have to manually start a Teamspeak server script just making sure the services like dns start automically =P
[07:26] <disinterseted_pe> yep usr$
[07:27] <gnomefreak> Pyru: yw but if you add the word multiverse after the word universe you should get more ;)
[07:27] <johannes_erik> gnomefreak windows 2000 was the only OS i ever used :D
[07:27] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ok type cd /usr
[07:27] <disinterseted_pe> cd /usr
[07:27] <Pyru> heh , alrighty ill try it , gnomefreak also is there a way i can browse desktop themes for ubuntu?
[07:27] <Flannel> Aeudian: yeah, teamspeak didn't automatically start?  Odd,  Oh, it isn't in the repositories, is it? you installed it by hand?
[07:27] <Aeudian> Flannel: yea by hand
[07:27] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:27] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe yup u type that in the terminal ? did it change ur directory ?
[07:28] <gnomefreak> Pyru: system>prefference>themes in the gnome menu
[07:28] <Flannel> Aeudian: that's why.  All packaged services have init.d entries, and thus get restarted and taken care of and stuff
[07:28] <bouncing> Ok, where is the python profiler in Ubuntu?
[07:28] <disinterseted_pe> still usr$
[07:28] <bouncing> Breezy
[07:28] <Aeudian> Flannel: cool anything in the init.d folder auto starts? didnt know that
[07:28] <Pyru> gnomefreak, is there available downloads , so i have more of a selection
[07:28] <johannes_erik> type cd on its own
[07:29] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe did that change the dir ?
[07:29] <roryy> bouncing: python2.4-profiler   (it's in multiverse)
[07:29] <bouncing> roryy: No, it isn't.
[07:29] <disinterseted_pe> now its just $
[07:29] <Aeudian> Flannel: so question if i put the script that i ./teamspeak start into the init.d folder would ts auto start?
[07:29] <johannes_erik> ahh movment :D
[07:29] <bouncing> roryy: It's referenced from multiverse, but is missing
[07:29] <roryy> heh
[07:29] <Flannel> Aeudian: well, its a little more complicated than that, but in a nutshell.  Those init.d scripts can also be used to restart any servers, like sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart would restart apache.
[07:29] <roryy> ah, ok
[07:29] <s|k> anyone here know anything about PHP5's SoapClient? I can't get it to work with Google's web api :/
[07:29] <gnomefreak> Pyru: yes you can check in synaptic theres some there also gnome-look.org also you can install gnome-art and with that no website needed it grabs the stuff off of art.gnome.com
[07:30] <Flannel> Aeudian: I dont know about that.  You might google a bit, or take a look, and see if theyre similar in structure.
[07:30] <johannes_erik> now cd /usr
[07:30] <Pyru> so i would do an apt-get install gnome-art ?
[07:30] <s|k> er
[07:30] <Pyru> this is my first day on linux
[07:30] <Pyru> sorry
[07:30] <Aeudian> Flannel: will do thanks Flannel
[07:30] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:30] <disinterseted_pe> usr$
[07:30] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe progress :D
[07:30] <Subhuman> Pyru,  "sudo apt-get install gnome-art"
[07:30] <gnomefreak> Pyru: yes that will do it
[07:30] <krang> how do I enable SCSI support if I'm using a Live CD?
[07:30] <Subhuman> !sudo
[07:30] <ubotu> sudo is probably a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[07:30] <roryy> bouncing: i'm downloading the package now. maybe it's architecture specific -- i'm on i386, what are you on?
[07:30] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ull get used to the basic commands after a short time :D
[07:30] <gnomefreak> yes sorry use sudo
[07:31] <disinterseted_pe> ok type progress?
[07:31] <bouncing> roryy: i386
[07:31] <Bilange> except xubuntu, is there any ubuntu projects/forks which aims at getting a really fast ubuntu installation? my goal is to get ubuntu fast enough for a Pentium 166 ans such
[07:31] <bouncing> roryy: Are you on dapper?
[07:31] <disinterseted_pe> i am
[07:31] <roryy> bouncing: nope, breezy
[07:31] <roryy> bouncing: what mirror are you using?
[07:31] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe progress was only a comment 8-))
[07:31] <mc|amb> hi, does anyone know where's the icon mail notification uses in the notifacation area??
[07:31] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:31] <disinterseted_pe> lol
[07:31] <foogle> Im dumb   what do I modprobe for linksys eth cards?
[07:31] <johannes_erik> now cd lib
[07:32] <gnomefreak> Bilange: xubuntu or server but your still kind of low on processer speed
[07:32] <gnomefreak> nothing is gonna be fast on a p166
[07:32] <disinterseted_pe> ok with the / ?
[07:32] <johannes_erik> no / this time
[07:32] <Flannel> Bilange: erm, just install server, then add stuff you need.  use ratpoison, heh.
[07:32] <Bilange> gnomefreak:  maybe I would have more chances with icewm, right?
[07:32] <krang> gnomefreak: what about DOS 6.22? Like lightning, i tell you!
[07:32] <disinterseted_pe> ok now ive got /usr$/lib
[07:32] <roryy> bouncing: it's here: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/p/python-profiler/
[07:33] <gnomefreak> Bilange: possibly but i cant say 166 is gonna give you speed with anything (how much ram is in it)?
[07:33] <johannes_erik> now cd mozilla-firefox
[07:33] <bouncing> Is there a way to tell apt-get to ignore dependencies? One of the mirrors I use for KDE 3.5.2 is wigging out and it won't let me proceed without it
[07:33] <Pyru> gnomefreak, is limewire the only p2p music downloader for linux out atm?
[07:33] <krang> Anyone: what module do I want to load for SCSI support off a Dapper flight 7 live CD?
[07:33] <Flannel> krang: a straight command line linux will run just as fast ;) he's looking for a WM I imagine
[07:33] <gnomefreak> Pyru: frostwire
[07:33] <disinterseted_pe> oppps /usr/lib$
[07:33] <gnomefreak> Pyru: there are a few iirc
[07:33] <metatag> hello all, how do i configure Grub to boot WinXP from a slave hdd?
[07:33] <bouncing> roryy: That just points to python2.4-profiler
[07:33] <fabio> ola a todos alguem do brasil
[07:33] <Flannel> !br
[07:33] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
[07:33] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe watch the - between mozilla and firefox , i missed it the first time lol
[07:33] <krang> Flannel: Damn small linux?
[07:33] <KungenLever> hepp
[07:34] <Pyru> gnomefreak, how do I install frostwire, same like apt-get install frostwire
[07:34] <roryy> bouncing: point your browser there; you will see several .deb files
[07:34] <Pyru> or do I have to get the source from the site
[07:34] <Bilange> gnomefreak:  Depends, from 32 to 128 at most... I have more than one machine I have to deal with, but my range of machine would be P[166-233] , [32-128]  of EDO
[07:34] <Pyru> and then install it
[07:34] <gnomefreak> Flannel: yes a straight server install should be fine on that but since he keeps bringing up wm i say its not gonna run fast
[07:34] <Flannel> krang: shrug, yeah.  server works just as well.  There are a few options for him.
[07:34] <roryy> bouncing: according to my aptitude, 2.4.1-1ubuntu1 is the one you want
[07:34] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell Pyru about limewire
[07:34] <foogle> Im dumb   what do I modprobe for linksys eth cards?
[07:34] <Flannel> Bilange: you might try some of the distros built for speed (and legacy hardware) since, older kernels are better with some of the older hardware, and smaller, and stuff.
[07:34] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell Pyru about frostwire
[07:34] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe any luck with the last one ?
[07:34] <disinterseted_pe> ok i did it
[07:35] <Brander> Im installing realplayer10 and the installation program whants me to choose a directory to install to, where would I what to install? the installation program choose my home directory but I dont what to install there right?
[07:35] <krang> foogle: dunno mate, but if you know what *I* need to modprobe for SCSI support, do let me know :-)
[07:35] <disinterseted_pe> i remembered the -
[07:35] <Bilange> Flannel:  I was googling about ratpoison, but thanks
[07:35] <metatag> Brander, try /opt
[07:35] <bouncing> roryy: Ok, it installed when I downloaded it by hand. Weird.
[07:35] <bouncing> roryy: thanks for your help
[07:35] <Mysta_> test
[07:35] <Brander> ok
[07:36] <illnor> hello - my ubuntu install here cannot run synaptic or firefox anymore.. i'm a newb that needs some help basically
[07:36] <foogle>  krang: I wish I could help you
[07:36] <krang> foogle: I wish i could help me too :-)
[07:36] <roryy> bouncing: no problem.
[07:36] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ok what directory u in now ?
=== beyond-rango is now known as beyond
[07:37] <Flannel> Bilange: but yeah, try a different distro, you'll be able to cut down on a lot of overhead.  DeliLinux's website gives some good info as to why one might want to use older kernels (2.2, for instance) and different xorgs and stuff ( http://www.delilinux.de/ )
[07:37] <disinterseted_pe> /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox$
[07:37] <TheBigToe> I have apache but when I try to view a php file it tries to download it instead of viewing it, and when I view an .inc file it shows it as plain text
[07:37] <Olde> bbl...........work time
[07:37] <kakashi> hi there
[07:37] <illnor> what i'd like to know simply.. is a command line way to install some other browswer.. like mozilla - not necessarily firefox or opera.. i386 ubuntu breezy
[07:37] <Flannel> TheBigToe: do you have php installed?
[07:37] <TheBigToe> yes, I think so
[07:37] <Flannel> illnor: which browser would you like?
[07:37] <illnor> i'd pick opera
[07:37] <TheBigToe> it should have installed it
[07:37] <johannes_erik> now cd plugins
[07:37] <disinterseted_pe> me?
[07:38] <Flannel> !tell illnor about opera
[07:38] <TheBigToe> yes Flannel, I do
[07:38] <kakashi> is someone good at PC hardware? or does someone just know what the description CL 2, 2.5 or means at RAM modules?! thanks for answers
[07:38] <Flannel> TheBigToe: the apache2/php package thing?
[07:38] <illnor> Flannel: thank you, i'll let you know how it works
[07:38] <FeestBijtje> any one knows how to set openal to alsa in the game ut2004?
[07:38] <TheBigToe> I have apache2, and php-4 and php-common
[07:38] <mnk> i am running easy webcam to detect my webcam - but it just seems to hang. is this normal?
[07:38] <Bilange> Flannel:  this goes straight into my bookmarks-- thanks :D
[07:39] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe yups type cd plugins
[07:39] <Subhuman> kakashi, CL2 and 3 is how many clock cycles it takes to access memory basically
[07:39] <disinterseted_pe> ok now its  /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins$
[07:39] <illnor> Flannel: the only problem is -- I am lacking of a web browser :)
[07:39] <FeestBijtje> mnk, try it on A-MSN there it should work
[07:39] <Bilange> cool, its even based on slackware, I wont be that lost :)
[07:39] <Subhuman> kakashi, so a lower number is better, but bigger sticks tend to have higher times
[07:39] <FeestBijtje> any one knows how to set openal to alsa in the game ut2004?
[07:39] <Flannel> TheBigToe: right, you have php installed, and apache installed,but no apache php module.  you'll want libapache2 (or libapache) -mod-php4
[07:39] <graft> how come my evolution only shows red 'X's instead of actual icons?
[07:39] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe now type dir
[07:39] <mnk> FeestBijtje: try what on aMSN? the webcam? it doesn't work on amsn
[07:39] <kakashi> Subhuman: what means clock cycle?
[07:39] <FeestBijtje> ANY ONE KNOWS HOW TO SETU OPENALL TO ALSA IN THE GAME UT2004?
[07:40] <Flannel> illnor: ah, um, use links, some CLI one.
[07:40] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:40] <TheBigToe> Flannel, oh, I have that
[07:40] <FeestBijtje> mnk, did you installed easycam2?
[07:40] <Flannel> FeestBijtje: don't get feisty, we heard you the first time.
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[07:40] <mnk> FeestBijtje: yes i did - but it is hanging
[07:40] <FeestBijtje> mnk, what webcam is it?
[07:40] <kakashi> Subhuman: and what does stick tend mean? im sry but im not so good at English ;o)
[07:40] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe u get a list of files ?
[07:40] <disinterseted_pe> ok i still got the same command line
[07:41] <disinterseted_pe> no
[07:41] <disinterseted_pe> just the same line as b4
[07:41] <krang> foogle: do you have a good LiveCD handy? You could boot from that and check what modules loaded
[07:41] <johannes_erik> just dir
[07:41] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_peas a single word
[07:41] <Flannel> TheBigToe: only thing I can think of is you might need to enable it.  go to your apache2 folder, check if mods enabled has some php thing in it.  it should be a symlink.
[07:41] <mnk> FeestBijtje: creative, it was working fine, and then i installed something on linux and then it stopped working
[07:42] <FeestBijtje> mnk, then un install that program you've installed
[07:42] <TheBigToe> i has php4.conf and php4.load
[07:42] <graft> how do i launch gnome control center from the command line?
[07:42] <foogle> krang: I got beatrix and it doesnt load it up
[07:42] <TheBigToe> it*
[07:42] <disinterseted_pe> ive got: /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins$
[07:42] <TheBigToe> and it has a couple of others too, but they're unrelated
[07:42] <foogle> krang: I'm tryin damn small linux now
[07:42] <krang> foogle: grab a copy of knoppix, it has great hardware detection.
[07:42] <mnk> i installed loads - not sure which it was :S

[07:43] <krang> foogle: it's *damn* small
[07:43] <Flannel> TheBigToe: alright, check the conf file, see if there's anything you might need to change.  What you're looking for is a ... oh, let me look.  Basically, you need to tell apache what to do with .php files
[07:43] <foogle> krang: It worrked!!!
[07:43] <TheBigToe> x-httpd-php or something isn't it?
[07:43] <GaiaX11> Does anyone here use an aerial for wireless card? I use this and the aerial is up in my house. It is 6metres high. The problem is that there is a big mango tree which belongs to my neighbour and it is higher than my aerial. So, my connection is becoming very low now. Do anyone know if it has any influence in getting the signal from the server provider big aerial?
[07:43] <mnk> FeestBijtje: i installed loads - not sure which it was :S
[07:43] <Flannel> TheBigToe: yeah, addType directives.
[07:44] <disinterseted_pe> i did dir in a single word and it came up as the /usr string again
[07:44] <FeestBijtje> mnk, we can't help you if you are not specivic
[07:44] <Flannel> TheBigToe: php5 installs nicely, never had any problems.

[07:45] <krang> foogle: jolly good, what's tulip?
[07:45] <kakashi> anyone here who anything about RAM modules?!
[07:45] <FeestBijtje> mnk, type in console: sudo apt-get remove easycam2
[07:45] <krang> kakashi: I know they look green
[07:45] <Subhuman> GaiaX11, that is not a ubuntu specific question, please ask it somewhere more specialised in this kinda thing.
[07:46] <Pyru> gnomefreak, I cant seem to find the frostwire package, the one i typed says errors encountered
[07:46] <FeestBijtje> mnk, then type: sudo apt-get install easycam2

[07:46] <[NP] Tangent> hey guys
[07:46] <qt4x11> are there any linux apps that will analyze server loads over a period of time and present server loads in a graph form over the web?
[07:46] <foogle> krang: tulip is the module that worked for my eth card
[07:46] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ill put all commands in speech marks so u know which bit i mean to type 8-)
[07:46] <kakashi> krang: ? you sure? i would like to know what is the meaning of CL in RAM ... i mean CL2 CL2.5 CL3 ?!
[07:46] <[NP] Tangent> just got Ubuntu installed on my laptop yesterday, and for the most part it is working flawlessly, and I love it
[07:47] <Flannel> qt4x11: webalyzer does that, I'm sure there are others
[07:47] <FeestBijtje> [NP] Tangent, good to hear
[07:47] <krang> kakashi: it's the latency of the RAM
[07:47] <[NP] Tangent> but I'm  having a problem with my wireless
[07:47] <[NP] Tangent> it works for a while
[07:47] <[NP] Tangent> like a few hours or so
[07:47] <krang> kakashi: I think you can set it in BIOS
[07:47] <[NP] Tangent> but then it just stops working altogether
[07:47] <GaiaX11> Subhuman, is there any channel related to the subject in freenode. If you know
[07:47] <FeestBijtje> [NP] Tangent, every one has troubles with wireless
[07:47] <qt4x11> doesn't webalizer just analyze apache logs?  i want load averages every 15 mins over a period of months
[07:47] <krang> kakashi: smaller=faster
[07:47] <sambagirl> anyone interested in getting involved into a very  exciting and different project associated with ubuntu and musica?
[07:47] <disinterseted_pe> h/o erik
[07:47] <[NP] Tangent> FeestBijtje, do you know why it stops working after a while?
[07:47] <kakashi> krang: i know this already but what does mean latency?
[07:48] <Subhuman> GaiaX11, not sure, might be worth googling a wifi forum.
[07:48] <FeestBijtje> [NP] Tangent, no but i do know every one got troubles with it some times and they are soulveable
[07:48] <Spec> FeestBijtje: i don't have problems with wireless
[07:48] <[NP] Tangent> alright
[07:48] <krang> kakashi: how quick the RAM responds, not clear on any more than that
[07:48] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: what wifi card?
[07:48] <disinterseted_pe> ok cd
[07:48] <[NP] Tangent> well I'll try doing some more searching to see if I find anything

[07:48] <krang> kakashi: np
[07:49] <Spec> brodock: gpg doesn't decrypt them?
[07:49] <disinterseted_pe> ?
[07:49] <[NP] Tangent> I'll check in case it applies to my card too
[07:49] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe did u put "cd ."  ?
[07:49] <kakashi> krang: so its just like access time within CD or DVD writers right?
[07:49] <disinterseted_pe> yep
[07:49] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe and the . ?
[07:49] <brodock> spec: gpg only works with pgp 1.x ... pgp 2x. have some pattended algorythms...
[07:49] <kakashi> krang: or something like this ...
[07:49] <krang> kakashi: careful though, sometimes it gets unstable if it's too low, depends on the RAM you have
[07:49] <disinterseted_pe> no
[07:49] <kakashi> krang: ok
[07:49] <Spec> is pgp 2.x more secure than pgp 1.x?
[07:50] <Pyru> gnomefreak, for some reason if i click on a download link i get an error pop up in firefox :S

[07:54] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[07:54] <Jimbob> hi
[07:54] <Spec> brodock: if you're working with the government though, it may be a better idea to obtain the commercial license for IDEA

[07:55] <[NP] Tangent> I'mdoing some searches, and a bunch of people are saying that the Intel Pro Wireless 2200BG card should work fine with Ubuntu
[07:55] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe do you see the dir you typed one line up ?
[07:55] <devie> The only *authorized* linux distro on government systems is RedHat
[07:55] <NoUse> !helpme
[07:55] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[07:55] <brodock> Spec: thanks man :)
[07:55] <disinterseted_pe> yes
[07:55] <Pyru> gnomefreak, any luck?
[07:56] <[NP] Tangent> I'm finding nothing relating to the problem I'm having

[07:56] <gnomefreak> Pyru: what does uname -r say
[07:56] <disinterseted_pe> it says /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins$dir
[07:56] <Jimbob> lol, so i was using live cd, but at the end of it it said somethign about some X and GUI...and it will stop the session until the problem is resolved
[07:56] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: perhaps it's dhcp releasing your ip
[07:56] <Pyru> 2.6.12-9-386
[07:57] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: check the lease times on IPs on your wireless router
[07:57] <Pyru> gnomefreak,  ^^
[07:57] <[NP] Tangent> alright

[07:57] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: also, I know nothing specific to that hardware -- i'm good with the broadcom 43xxs
[07:57] <gnomefreak> Pyru: on the site ubotu gave you did you download the .deb file for it?
[07:57] <Jimbob> anyone? i think it might be a graphics card problem
[07:57] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ok sudo dir
[07:57] <Pyru> if i click the .deb file link i get that error pop up
[07:57] <disinterseted_pe> ok

[07:58] <gnomefreak> Pyru: here click on ubuntu/debian here http://www.frostwire.com/
[07:58] <Keegan> will there be an issue with screws lineing up and so forth?
[07:58] <disinterseted_pe> then it says the same string

[08:03] <Pyru> gnomefreak, no but i havnt restarted since I did the major sources.list update
[08:03] <graft> arr! so if i try and use 'nuvola' theme, GNOME apps keep dying
[08:03] <Pyru> maybe I should heh
[08:03] <graft> what gives?
[08:03] <gnomefreak> Pyru: i would try that first
[08:03] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe what folder are you in at the moment just $ ?
[08:03] <Pyru> gnomefreak, alright brb.
[08:03] <disinterseted_pe> yeah nothing with totem

[08:04] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe thats ur base directory
[08:04] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[08:04] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe is there a folder called opt ?
[08:04] <disinterseted_pe> no lib?
[08:05] <graft> goo. now i can't even load my theme manager to switch back
[08:05] <graft> how do i change my gnome theme by hand?
[08:05] <johannes_erik> disinterseted_pe ok 1 moment ill check to see where else it could be
[08:05] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[08:06] <jorgg> how can I make my laptop autoconnect to WLAN when i use the laptop at two different places?
[08:07] <graft> jorgg: networkmanager?
[08:07] <graft> assuming it plays nice with your wireless card
[08:07] <Pyru> gnomefreak, now the link works if i try to download it ;)
[08:07] <Pyru> wonder if apt-get will work
[08:07] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe cd home
[08:07] <gnomefreak> Pyru: figured as much
[08:07] <gnomefreak> Pyru: not on that no
[08:08] <graft> dagnabit... does anyone know how to change your gnome theme?
[08:08] <Pyru> gnomefreak, so should I download the .deb file?
[08:08] <graft> not via the control center...
[08:08] <jorgg> graft: when i boot the networkmanager loads its icon in system tray, but it doesnt find any interface, even though eth1 is in function
[08:08] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe now cd /home
[08:08] <gnomefreak> Pyru: read the install directions after you download it cd to where the download is and run sudo dpkg -i file.deb
[08:08] <gnomefreak> Pyru: yes
[08:08] <graft> jorgg: yeah you should comment everything out of /etc/network/interfaces
[08:08] <Pyru> I just downloaded it to my desktop
[08:08] <graft> which for some reason makes networkmanager unhappy
[08:08] <gnomefreak> Pyru: now cd Desktop
[08:09] <jorgg> graft: ah.. okay, Il try that, how do i reboot networkmanager?
[08:09] <krang> graft: system: prefernces: theme
[08:09] <disinterseted_pe> my mouse went crazy and closed the terminal
[08:09] <gnomefreak> Pyru: than your prompt should look like this gnomefreak@DapperDrake:~/Desktop$
[08:09] <gnomefreak> well with your info not mine
[08:09] <graft> krang: i can't do it that way, it keeps crashing... i have to do it by hand
[08:10] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe thats ok , just open a new one :)
[08:10] <disinterseted_pe> no such file erik
[08:10] <johannes_erik> cd /home
[08:10] <gnomefreak> johannes_erik: cd will bring you back to home

[08:10] <Flannel> cd ~ is easier
[08:10] <Pyru> gnomefreak, it shows up as an icon in internet but if i click it , nothing happens lol
[08:11] <Pyru> quite possibly because , I have not installed java
[08:11] <johannes_erik> thanks gnomefreak :)
[08:11] <Pyru> dur
[08:11] <gnomefreak> Pyru: is it on your desktop?
[08:11] <gnomefreak> Pyru: yes install java first

[08:24] <disinterseted_pe> yeah ok
[08:24] <cjfp> Flannel: why is that offtopic?
[08:24] <gnomefreak> Pyru: sudo apt-get install j2re1.4

[08:26] <gnomefreak> Pyru: lets say you wanted to install links2, lynx, bluefish you would typ sudo apt-get install links2 bluefish lynx
[08:26] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe  cp /home/{FILE} /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[08:26] <Pyru> ahhh i c
[08:27] <Pyru> thanks
[08:27] <Pyru> gnomefreak, another question how would I auto enable my wireless connection because after restarting I have to goto network connections and manually enable it after restarting everytime.
[08:27] <gnomefreak> Pyru: let me know when done there is another command you need to run
[08:27] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe u have to do this for all the .so and .xpt files :)
[08:27] <disinterseted_pe> right but if i add mplayer behind cd home it doesnt come up
[08:27] <gnomefreak> Pyru: that i dont know im not a wireless guy
[08:28] <miki> mhm. I've been using ubuntu for about 1 year, then I moved up to debian. I couldn't get rid of that dummy package, errors in ported packages etc. Now after using debian for about 4 months I think I'll swap back. I need a OS which just works. In debian everything has to be done by hand. I spend all my time in the front ot the computer compiling or configuring something. I need fscking frontend default, dummy packaged system that just works, where I don't have to si
[08:28] <gnomefreak> brb need a smoke
[08:28] <Pyru> heh kk thanks anyways , java should be done in a few mins.
[08:28] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe its not cd though its cp
[08:28] <joeyk> heya people.. how can you replace the ubuntu icon beside the Applications menu to the default gnome icons the foot?
[08:28] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[08:28] <joeyk> sounds weird.. but i like it
[08:28] <joeyk> :)
[08:28] <mish4> is there a way to mount windows in ubuntu, so that ubuntu can write to the windows (ntfs) partition?
[08:28] <mish4> not just read
[08:29] <mish4> from ubuntu guide it says to do this: /dev/hda1 /media/windows ntfs umask=0222 0 0 , but that is only for reading
[08:30] <roryy> !tell mish4 about ntfs
[08:30] <disinterseted_pe> cp missing destination file
[08:30] <krang> Anyone know how to make ubuntu recognise my SCSI disk? I've not got anything else to install to, and i know it's possible, because ubuntu is already on here (albeit a tad broken)
[08:30] <Pyru> does ubuntu have a way to install steam?
[08:30] <krang> SCSI Hard disk, that is
[08:30] <Pyru> like so I can play counterstrike on it :P
[08:30] <krang> lol
[08:30] <roryy> mish4: fwiw, there is a windows app that can read ext3 (the default linux fs)
[08:30] <gnomefreak> !steam
[08:30] <ubotu> somebody said steam was http://www.steampowered.com
[08:30] <lerch> Everytime I try to unrar something it says "x failed" (x being the amount of files in the bundle). But if I use the -t command I get a neat list of files in the .rar... I use unrar-free... what is wrong?
[08:31] <krang> Pyru: Open your case, place kettle inside case, plug kettle in
[08:31] <mish4> gotchya. so pretty much with ntfs i cant write from ubuntu to windows. like download files but save them to windows?
[08:31] <disinterseted_pe> ?
[08:31] <Pyru> krang, I'll pass thanks anywyas lolol
[08:32] <krang> Pyru: :-)
[08:32] <johannes_erik> im still here lol
[08:32] <disinterseted_pe> cp missing destination file
[08:32] <Pyru> gnomefreak,  should I grant stopthread?

[08:34] <mish4> and instead i mounted /dev/hda1 to /media/windows
[08:34] <mish4> is that okay?
[08:34] <gnomefreak> Pyru: now type java --version
[08:34] <Pyru> gnomefreak, wonder why frostwire still doesn't work

[08:36] <Spliffster> high room, anyone here is using the LTSP packages ... how stable are these (i have read on ltsp.org, that ubuntu is shipping it's own version currently, eg. own LTSP branch)
[08:36] <Spliffster> ?
[08:36] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe u need all the .so and .xpi files apart from the totem ones back in the /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins    folder
[08:37] <plbgnr> does anybody use irda port (usb to irda device)  ? I can see my mobile phone in irdadump output, but, can't find software for further work :(
[08:37] <t-thing> Hi. Is it possible to make bootable dvd out of cd xubuntu iso? I just noticed that I don't have any blank cds left and I really need that iso burned.
[08:37] <disinterseted_pe> yeah ok
[08:37] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe u can trash the totem ones but u still need the other .xpi and .so files back in that dir
[08:38] <plbgnr> actually ...working software...
[08:38] <disinterseted_pe> cant for file in the command cant i just use the actual like gmp.so file for the name?
[08:39] <disinterseted_pe> wouldnt they stay in the root folder?
[08:39] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe  yip so example   sudo /home/gmp.so /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins
[08:39] <disinterseted_pe> ok

=== Deep1 is now known as Deep6
[08:44] <mirno> even better
[08:44] <disinterseted_pe> i didnt
[08:44] <Subhuman> t-thing, just like burning a CD, just use a DVD instead.
[08:44] <Subhuman> or do u mean how to burn an iso?
[08:45] <mirno> better then windows
[08:46] <t-thing> Subhuman: Well, yeah. I have bootable cd iso and I need to burn it to dvd so that is still bootable.
[08:46] <disinterseted_pe> ?
[08:47] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe did it work once ?
[08:47] <disinterseted_pe> no
[08:47] <Subhuman> t-thing, just do it in the exact same way you would burn a CD, just use a DVD, it will still be bootable
[08:47] <bubblenut> how can I find out and set the host and domain names for my machine?
[08:47] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe try with nautilus
[08:48] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe that should work :)
[08:48] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[08:48] <johannes_erik> disinterested_pe infact thats a better idea than all the crap i suggest lol !
[08:48] <Subhuman> bubblenut, goto System-Admin-Networking then click the General tab.

[08:56] <GigaFisse> anyone willing to help me with a WLAN problem ?
[08:57] <t-thing> Subhuman: I was thinking that the bootable part and something else might be different with dvds but now that I think of it, it does make sense that cd iso would work just as fine with dvd. The dvd just got burned, so see ya.
[08:57] <disinterseted_pe> maybe i'll find something more difficult next time
[08:57] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: willing, but can't promise

[09:03] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: oh i got it
[09:04] <GigaFisse> heres the deal
[09:04] <oven> I just installed ubuntu 5.10 from cd. When I click system -> administration -> synaptic, nothing happens. How do I debug this?
[09:04] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: my problem  is this WLAN USB stick (ZyXEL B-220), its using zd1201 chipset, and (i think) theres nothing wrong with driver and firmware
[09:04] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: but i can't get it to do DHCP
[09:05] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: it works well in Windows...
[09:05] <soundray> oven: have you created just one user during the installation?
[09:05] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: i don't know your hardware. basic question: are you running a firewall that is blocking dhcp (icmp AFAIK) traffic ?
[09:05] <oven> soundray: yes
[09:05] <oven> soundray: that's the one I'm using
[09:06] <soundray> oven: can you open the gnome-terminal?
[09:06] <oven> soundray: yes :)
[09:06] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: i am using firestarter here on this desktop .... i had to enable the dhcp option for my wifi interface so it would have worked. does it work if you use a static address ?
[09:06] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: not at all... its just plain Ubuntu 5.10 with this USB WLAN stick..... the problem consists of not connecting to router..
[09:06] <soundray> oven, can you enter a command with sudo in there?
[09:06] <oven> soundray: do I have to be in the sudo or wheel group?
[09:06] <soundray> oven: you have to be in the admin group.
[09:07] <soundray> oven, but the first user is in there by default, normally
[09:07] <oven> soundray: do you mean adm?
[09:07] <soundray> oven, no, admin
[09:07] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: i am a little newbie what is firestarter  (firewall??) and how would you enable dhcp on wifi
[09:07] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: driver problem ... hgave you tried to compile your own (mayb newer) kernel ? ... have you read up on the developers page (if any) ? i had quiet some problems to get my ipw2200 working 1 year ago
[09:07] <dooglus> oven: I don't think it's been 'adm' since hoary
[09:08] <oven> soundray: there is no admin group
[09:08] <oven> soundray: and this is a fresh install
[09:08] <oven> dooglus: strange
[09:08] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: hmm driver problem?  the driver is a part of the kernel
[09:08] <soundray> oven, that's strange. Would it be a major sacrifice to reinstall?
[09:08] <oven> soundray: no, not at all
[09:08] <oven> soundray: but I don't see how that would help, if I used the same cd again :)
[09:09] <soundray> oven: debugging this may well take longer. These things happen occasionally, and are often fixed by a reinstall.
[09:09] <dooglus> oven: can you read the contents of /etc/sudoers ?
[09:09] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: it's a kernel module i guess. this would basicly mean a kernel recompilation in case there are newer kernel sources available for your driver.
[09:09] <oven> dooglus: no, not as my user
[09:09] <dooglus> soundray: it would be better to fix whatever causes it, wouldn't it?
[09:09] <dooglus> oven: did you set a root password?
[09:09] <oven> dooglus: yes
[09:10] <oven> dooglus: and I can su to root
[09:10] <soundray> dooglus: it would be better, but it could be a rough ride.
[09:10] <gnomefreak> :(
[09:10] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: but first you should ask mr. google if there are newer sources available
[09:10] <GigaFisse> Spliffster:  i don't think you are correct..    from zd1201-driver page: "Now it is part of the main kernel tree as of 2.6.12. "
[09:10] <oven> soundray, dooglus - could I just add an admin user?
[09:10] <oven> soundray, dooglus - or should I reinstall using some debug options (if any)?
[09:10] <dooglus> oven: it's a group, and you could, but you need to be root to do it
[09:10] <soundray> oven: did you do an "expert" install?
[09:10] <oven> admin group, I meant
[09:10] <oven> sorry
=== Napoleon is now known as Mabus06
[09:11] <oven> dooglus: ok, no problem. What gid should I use? Just the first available?
[09:11] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: ok, then (and only if the driver si the problem) you might want to check for newer kernel sources (ubuntu laggs a bit behind).
[09:11] <dooglus> over, "su" to root, and then "grep ^% /etc/sudoers" <-- what does that say?
[09:12] <oven> dooglus: there are no lines starting with %
[09:12] <dooglus> oven, odd
[09:12] <joeyk> heya people.. how can you replace the ubuntu icon beside the Applications menu to the default gnome icons the foot?
[09:12] <dooglus> I have: # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
[09:12] <dooglus> %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
[09:12] <oven> soundray: no, I used a normal install
[09:12] <oven> there was one strange thing that happened during the install.
[09:12] <oven> actually, there were two
[09:12] <soundray> oven: how did you create root, then?
[09:13] <gnomefreak> oven: should look simular to this %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL but since you enabled su you wont get that iirc
[09:13] <oven> soundray: using the install program
[09:13] <dooglus> soundray: that's a good question.  the install program doesn't ask for a root password.
[09:13] <g0dchild> I am unable to play any music on amarok-1.4 without this pkg- and i just read on the forum that i'd be needing this package
[09:13] <gnomefreak> dooglus: since your grepping sudoers he disabled it so he has no sudoers
[09:13] <soundray> oven, hmm, I didn't know that was possible.
[09:13] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: could you maybe give me a hint how to do that?  i saw on Ubuntu Package archive, that there was this "linux-source-foo.deb" file, but i can't seem to install the package ??
[09:13] <oven> The first strange thing was that "copy the remaining archives" failed. I figured that was not a big problem, since I could always copy them manually
[09:13] <g0dchild> is it possible to get xine-extracodecs on breezy?
[09:13] <dooglus> gnomefreak: what do you mean?
[09:14] <g0dchild> !dapper
[09:14] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[09:14] <oven> the second thing was that after the reboot during the install process, the install program did not ask for my cd, so apt just hung indefinitely
[09:14] <oven> so I had to -HUP apt-get in order to make it recognize the cd
[09:14] <dooglus> oven: it sounds like the install didn't complete properly.
[09:14] <gnomefreak> dooglus: the command is looking for /etc/sudoers but enabling su disables sudo so now sudo has no rights
[09:14] <dooglus> gnomefreak: su is never disabled.
[09:15] <dooglus> gnomefreak: what does 'enabling su' mean?
[09:15] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: oh sorry. you can download the latest source at ftp://kernel.org .. get the latest available 2.6 kernel (roughly 40-50MB). then you need some packages .... i'll get you the link in the meanwhile
[09:15] <gnomefreak> dooglus: the su password is disabled by default
[09:15] <Spec> dooglus: root password is disabled by default
[09:15] <gnomefreak> !root
[09:15] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[09:15] <dooglus> Spec: that's true.  but setting a root password doesn't disable sudo
[09:15] <Spec> dooglus: you could 'su <otheruser>' just fine, so in that respect, su is not disabled
[09:15] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: get a development kernel.
[09:15] <Spec> dooglus: of course not
[09:15] <dooglus> Spec: that's what gnomefreak seems to think
[09:15] <gnomefreak> dooglus: you have to enable it
[09:16] <GigaFisse> Spliffster:  hmmm... shouldn't i use an Ubuntu kernel ?
[09:16] <gnomefreak> read the site above
[09:16] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I don't
[09:16] <Spec> dooglus: i'm sure gnomefreak doesn't think that setting a root password doesn't disable sudo access ^.^
[09:16] <oven> hm, that's strange, when I think of it... the installer specifically asked for a root password
[09:16] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: or have i misunderstood something major ?  :D
[09:16] <Flannel> oven: only if you do expert install
[09:16] <gnomefreak> dooglus: after you run the dpkg -l command you need to change a file to enable sudo again or its gonna default to su
[09:16] <oven> does the installer fall back to expert install in case of an error?
[09:16] <casey> hey guys.
[09:16] <Spec> or rather, he doesn't think that setting a root password disables sudo access.... :p
[09:16] <Flannel> oven: I believe so.
[09:16] <oven> that could be it
[09:17] <Inazad> Hi there, I have downloaded and installed w32codecs and mplayer but I still not able to view .wmv videos .. ?
[09:17] <casey> I'm running an ubuntu live CD.  I have set the user and root passwords, however when I try to lock the screen nothing happens
[09:17] <oven> since the "copy remaining archives" step failed
[09:17] <Flannel> and, no, enabling root doesnt disable sudo
[09:17] <gnomefreak> Flannel: explain why after enabling su sudo no longer works
[09:17] <Inazad> Here it's my pastebin --> http://pastebin.com/731670
[09:17] <Pyru> gnomefreak, what was the command to install more themes again please?
[09:17] <oven> maybe I should verify my .iso image md5sum, burn another cd and do a fresh install again
[09:17] <Flannel> gnomefreak: erm, su isn't 'enabling root', I never said anything about su ;)
[09:18] <dooglus> gnomefreak: what dpkg -l command?  that lists packages.  why would I run dpkg -l?  and what's gonna default to su?
[09:18] <gnomefreak> Flannel: we were talking about su
[09:18] <gnomefreak> Pyru: sudo apt-get install gnome-art
[09:18] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I have a root password set, and sudo works just fine.
[09:18] <gnomefreak> Pyru: than run it
[09:18] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: the ubuntu kernel is a patched debian kernel which is a patched kernel.org kernel. you are correct that you'll use quiet some convenience (of having the right patches applied fro splash screen etc.). on the other hand, you'll get a top-notch, with-all-that-gold-and-glitter kernel from kernel.org
[09:19] <gnomefreak> not dpkg sorry its sudo passwd -l root
[09:19] <meheren> how can I get the close maximize/minimize buttons on the left side of the window? i'm on gnome
[09:19] <casey> any ideas on what I need to do to get screen locking working?
[09:19] <gnomefreak> dooglus: than you have to change /etc/shadow to enable sudo again
[09:19] <stjepan> !gplflash
[09:19] <ubotu> Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, stjepan
[09:19] <dooglus> gnomefreak: passwd -l will lock an account.  it changes /etc/shadow.
[09:19] <gnomefreak> dooglus: yes it will relock su
[09:19] <stjepan> anyone knows from where can I download the script for installing IE6 with Flash and Shockwave (under wine, of course)
[09:19] <gnomefreak> as oven to run sudo apt-get update
[09:20] <gnomefreak> i bet it doesnt run
[09:20] <gnomefreak> ask*
[09:20] <Inazad> Hi there, I have downloaded and installed w32codecs and mplayer but I still not able to view .wmv videos .. ?   http://pastebin.com/731670
[09:20] <dooglus> gnomefreak: "locking su" isn't useful terminology.  "su" doesn't get locked, the root password does.
[09:20] <abrar> HELP! My update notifier is eating HEAVY resource... 100% CPU usage is seen. i wan to disable it or stop it form starting automatically!! HOW?? <<<
[09:20] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: well, will gnome work and everything after i apply a new kernel?
[09:20] <gnomefreak> dooglus: you new what i meant
[09:20] <gnomefreak> knew even
[09:21] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I now what you mean yes, but it would be clearer for others if you used more helpful words.
[09:21] <zcat[1] > just for the record, I have a root password set (although it's not a good idea and I almost never use it anyhow) .. 'sudo -i' to get a root shell, 'passwd root' to set the root password.. sudo still works, root logins work. afaik su is/was already installed but I never use that either.
[09:21] <gnomefreak> oven: go back to a $ prompt and type sudo apt-get update please
[09:21] <tag> anyone use a dual monitor setup?
[09:21] <tag> anyone use a dual monitor setup with the nv driver?
[09:21] <dooglus> you make it sound like the 'su' command is being turned on and off, which it isn't.
[09:21] <tag> rather
[09:21] <zcat[1] > I have no idea what you did that broke sudo, but setting a root password shouldn't have made any difference..
[09:21] <oven> gnomefreak: oven@pondus:~$ sudo apt-get update || echo fail
[09:21] <oven> fail
[09:21] <tag> Both monitors show up through the boot process...etc..but when I get to X, the left one works and the right one is garbage
[09:21] <Pyru> gnomefreak, do you know where I can get that weather manager? for linux
[09:21] <Pyru> i had it once before
[09:21] <Pyru> but forget
[09:21] <dooglus> zcat[1] : me too.  I set it yesterday when I needed it for a short while.
[09:22] <gnomefreak> dooglus: no but the password being locked due to it never being set up that renders su usless unless you enable the password
[09:22] <Pyru> its like a little icon that shows the weather and tempature for ur panel
[09:22] <speedsix> Hi does anyone know if I car start an app on a particular workspace?
[09:22] <ericz> tag, i have dual monitors with the "nvidia" driver... but they work with "nv"
[09:22] <gnomefreak> Pyru: check synaptic
[09:22] <abrar> Please HELP! My update notifier is eating HEAVY resource... 100% CPU usage is seen. i wan to disable it or stop it form starting automatically!! HOW?? <<<
[09:22] <dooglus> gnomefreak: "su" isn't useless - it is used to become any other user you like, so long as you know their password.
[09:22] <tag> ericz: what's the difference?
[09:22] <Inazad> Hi there, I have downloaded and installed w32codecs and mplayer but I still not able to view .wmv videos .. ?   http://pastebin.com/731670
[09:22] <tag> ericz: care to help me trouble shoot my xorg.conf?
[09:22] <gnomefreak> dooglus: su doesnt have a default password
[09:22] <meheren> how can I get the close maximize/minimize buttons on the left side of the window?
[09:22] <ericz> tag, none as far as i can tell.. but the nvidia driver gives a weird splash screen before X is run
[09:22] <gnomefreak> oven: did you type the echo part?
[09:23] <oven> gnomefreak: yes
[09:23] <shinu> A
[09:23] <shinu> A
[09:23] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: this document describes <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowto> how to build a kernel with the debian tools (Which are used by ubuntu). at the stage where they "apt-get install <some kernel> thne extract it with tar, at this stage you should download your own kernel and extract it there.
[09:23] <shinu> oops
[09:23] <oven> gnomefreak: just to show that it fails with an error code
[09:23] <acke> Hahahahha, I need to use an application that is to big for my screen resolution.......
[09:23] <shinu> ignore that xD
[09:23] <gnomefreak> oven: just type sudo apt-get update
[09:23] <Inazad> Hi there, I have downloaded and installed w32codecs and mplayer but I still not able to view .wmv videos .. ?   http://pastebin.com/731670
[09:23] <meheren> gnomefreak, undr install you can set one if you do an "expert" install
[09:23] <dooglus> gnomefreak: you seem a little confused.  "su" is a command.  it wouldn't have a password.  accounts have passwords, not commands.
[09:23] <tag> ericz: Right, I've seen that before ( when I used debian )
[09:23] <meheren> how can I get the close maximize/minimize buttons on the left side of the window?
[09:23] <oven> gnomefreak: then nothing happens
[09:23] <gnomefreak> meheren: correct
[09:23] <acke> the app is probablly for 1200xsomthing and i only have 1024x 800
[09:23] <zcat[1] > 'su' doesn't have _ANY_ password... any more than 'login' has a password.
[09:23] <ericz> tag: what's your problem with dual monitors?
[09:23] <gnomefreak> dooglus: if it doesnt disable sudo password why cant he run sudo commands?
[09:23] <meheren> yeh
[09:24] <Spliffster> GigaFisse: if you are new to *nix, this might be easier to get in touch with the driver developer
[09:24] <meheren> su is a command to change to user root
[09:24] <abrar> HELP! My update notifier is eating HEAVY resource... 100% CPU usage is seen. i wan to disable it or stop it form starting automatically!! HOW?? <<<
[09:24] <dooglus> gnomefreak: because his install failed part way though and never got around to setting up his sudoers file.  that's my guess.  what's yours?
[09:24] <GigaFisse> Spliffster: ok thanks... can i ask what some of the patches is that debian and ubuntu applies ?
[09:24] <acke> Maybe i can rotate the screen to get to the controlls on the bottom.. :(
[09:24] <tag> ericz: Here is my xorg.conf... http://sial.org/pbot/17294 my problem is that when I log into X, the right monitor is nothing but garbled (wierd vertical lines and such) and I cannot stretch my mouse over to it, so I think it's just not set up right or something
[09:24] <dooglus> oven: su to root and do: "apt-get --reinistall sudo"  that should fix it
[09:24] <abrar> >> Howdo i DISABLE update-notifier from starting automattically??
[09:24] <dooglus> oops
[09:24] <gnomefreak> dooglus: now i dont know about that because i just helped someone yesterday with same issue

[09:25] <dooglus> gnomefreak: right.  because he doesn't have a line beginning with '%' in his /etc/sudoers.
[09:25] <meheren> is there a way to get the action buttons like close maximize minimize on the left side of the window under gnome?
[09:25] <gnomefreak> g0dchild: stop that please
[09:25] <gnomefreak> g0dchild: use .msg ubotu
[09:25] <gnomefreak> g0dchild: /msg ubotu
[09:26] <oven> dooglus: nope, that didn't help. It also didn't add an 'admin' group
[09:26] <g0dchild> oops, sorry-
=== Superuser is now known as Warlord384
[09:26] <dooglus> gnomefreak: that line is what gives access to regular users who are in the 'admin' group
[09:26] <g0dchild> stopped. :D
[09:26] <Spliffster> bah, why bother if there is #ubuntu.
[09:26] <mxpxpod> meheren: yes, you'll need to use gconf-editor
[09:26] <oven> dooglus: and it didn't touch /etc/sudoers
[09:26] <gnomefreak> dooglus: he has to change the /etc/shadow file to have a * after root not an !
[09:26] <dooglus> oven: I wouldn't recommend running "passwd -l root" - it will lock the root account, and then you'll not be able to fix anything without booting into rescue mode
[09:27] <meheren> mxpxpod, do i have to install or does it come base?
[09:27] <dooglus> gnomefreak: he can log in as root already using su

[09:38] <cmatheson> dust: says it affects it in what way?
[09:38] <disinterseted_pe> how do i get the volume control on my keybard to work

[09:39] <disinterseted_pe> the volume bar moves up but the volume doesnt
[09:39] <Pyru> page still isnt loading the flash
[09:39] <Inazad> Anyone can help me?

[09:40] <gnomefreak> oven: are your su and sudo passwords the same?
[09:40] <gnomefreak> Pyru: hold on a sec theres more
[09:40] <dust> cmatheson: well it seems that megacity is 'buggy', and also if a video is open on the second monitor megacity will open windows on top of them.
[09:40] <gnomefreak> Pyru: what version of ff are you using?
[09:41] <Pyru> 1.08

[09:41] <Inazad> Pyru,  I have 1.5
[09:41] <Inazad> PyroMithrandir,  :-)

[09:42] <PyroMithrandir> :P tab complete
[09:42] <dust> cmatheson: in general are you happy with openbox? is it glitchy or require a lot of setup?
[09:42] <oven> gnomefreak: what are you talking about?
=== waky is now known as msyg|sleepy
[09:42] <gnomefreak> oven: when you set the usr password and su password are they the same password?
[09:43] <dooglus> gnomefreak: I think we've got it sorted now.  if you set a root password when you install, then sudo isn't set up to allow members of the admin group to log in.
[09:43] <gnomefreak> Pyru: try this sudo update-flashplugin
[09:43] <gnomefreak> Pyru: than restart ff
[09:43] <gnomefreak> correct thats why i asked what password he set he answered both
[09:43] <galo> hola
[09:43] <cmatheson> dust: yeah, i like openbox a lot... it's not  glitchy, very little setup depending on much you want to customize it... i don't know about windows opening on top of others depending on which monitor you're on though
[09:43] <galo> hello
[09:44] <Pyru> gnomefreak, no new version is detected
[09:44] <Pyru> it already has that update
[09:44] <galo> somebody here uses amule and can give me a hand to try to get the best ?
[09:44] <gnomefreak> Pyru: restart ff flash should work
[09:44] <dooglus> it looks like the best thing to do if you want both sudo and su to work is to not set the root password when you install, but to set it later using 'sudo passwd'
[09:44] <dust> cmatheson: when i switch over will my panel setting remain?
[09:44] <gnomefreak> Pyru: if not type about:config in the address bar and see if flash is in there and enabled
[09:44] <dooglus> that way the 'passwd' package will still set up sudo to work for group 'admin'
[09:45] <cmatheson> dust: if you're going to use GNOME, yes.  if you just use openbox though you won't have a panel

[09:47] <dooglus> I'm having a strange problem with a cifs mount.  I can write to it pretty quickly, but reading from it is 10 times slower.
[09:47] <galo> hello, please, can somebody help me to configure amule or to get the best servers ?
[09:47] <Jeff1983> i purchased some tv shows on dvd. i'd like to rip the commentary tracks only (i.e. no video) is there a way to do this?
[09:47] <dooglus> I can download off the net 10 times faster than I can read from the cifs drive I've mounted - and that's just feet away.
[09:47] <dooglus> I used "sudo mount -t cifs -o password=,uid=chris //$server/d ~/smb/server/d;" to mount it - does that look OK?
[09:49] <dust> cmatheson: yeah, i'll keep using gnome. in the wiki it says that if i like openbox i can save my settings before logging out to set it as the default window manager, if i don't save the session (say i don't like openbox) the next time i log on megacity should be there?
[09:49] <Flannel> dust: GDM defaults to "the window manager I used last time" if I remembe correctly.
[09:50] <r0xoR> dust, i love openbox
[09:50] <cmatheson> dust: yes
[09:50] <r0xoR> dust, openbox is good for certain people, not good for others
[09:50] <galo> what is openbox ?
[09:51] <r0xoR> dust, personally i use GNOME atm :)
[09:51] <dooglus> galo: it's a window manager
[09:51] <r0xoR> galo, if you don't know what openbox is you probably don't need it... but then again you might
[09:51] <dooglus> galo: it's much lighter than using a desktop environment like GNOME or KDE - but lacks features too
[09:51] <r0xoR> galo, openbox is a very very fast window manager with not a lot of bells and whistles like in GNOME
[09:51] <Mysta_> what about XFCE?
[09:51] <r0xoR> galo, there's no panel and no desktop per se
[09:51] <dooglus> Mysta_: XFCE is somewhere between the 2 extremes
[09:51] <r0xoR> galo, you do have a right click menu that can be customized
[09:52] <r0xoR> meh, XFCE is becoming another GNOME/KDE pretty quickly
[09:52] <r0xoR> though it is faster than GNOME
[09:52] <Mysta_> dooglus: the screenshots I saw on their website look impressive.
[09:52] <r0xoR> if you add all the features that GNOME has to XFCE it'll be about the same speed :P
[09:52] <Mysta_> so if I wanted to try out XFCE it wouldn't be hard
[09:52] <dooglus> Mysta_: it's my desktop of choice at the moment
[09:52] <r0xoR> Mysta_, nah, not at all
[09:52] <r0xoR> Mysta_, you can get it with synaptic
[09:53] <galo> better than xfce4?
[09:53] <galo> or a kind of ?
[09:53] <dooglus> Mysta_: all you need to do is install "xubuntu_desktop" and it will be added to the list of sessions available from the gdm login screen
[09:53] <astrisk> hello reply plz.......
[09:53] <r0xoR> galo, what better than what now?
[09:53] <galo> xfce4 ...
[09:53] <r0xoR> sudo apt-get install xubuntu_desktop
[09:53] <r0xoR> ?
[09:53] <r0xoR> galo, FVWM is leet too :)
[09:53] <dust> rQxoR: what people is it good for-- say (for example) a person (not necessarily me)  just uses a computer, they don't program (or even know how) and would be considered semi-useful with computers and are fairly XP or OSX minded-- would openbox be okay for them?
[09:53] <Blabla> Hi, when I play RO with wine, I got a graphical problem, what could be the reason ?
[09:53] <r0xoR> dust, probably not
[09:54] <Flannel> r0xoR: no, it's a dash.
[09:54] <Flannel> xubuntu-desktop
[09:54] <r0xoR> dust, for that you want GNOME or KDE
[09:54] <dust> rQxoR: who is it good for?
[09:54] <r0xoR> dust, slow computers and people who know what they're doing
[09:55] <Mysta_> dooglus: thx
[09:55] <r0xoR> dust, at least people who are willing to read the manual
[09:55] <mad_phoenix> so, does anybody know how to get eclipse to run on top of sun jdk instead of gij?  I made JDK my default runtime (using update-alternatives), but when i run top I can still see that gij is running it

[09:58] <galo> r0xoR, please can you explin me what leet means ... a synonim... or whatever please
[09:59] <r0xoR> hahah... leet is an english permutation of the ending of the word elite...
[09:59] <Pyru> gnomefreak, what app would I use to burn cd's Nero?
[09:59] <ShadowNova> k3b
[09:59] <MetaMorfoziS> leet is a way to transform characters, not?
[09:59] <r0xoR> galo, so leet is short for elite... elite refers to people who think they are gods gift to the universe
[09:59] <dust> does anyone know if there is a difference between xinerama and twinview (or how the two interact)?

[10:02] <[NP] Tangent> but does K3V work in Gnome?
[10:02] <ShadowNova> Yes
[10:02] <[NP] Tangent> K3B*
[10:02] <[NP] Tangent> cool
[10:02] <ShadowNova> Any kde app will.
[10:02] <ShadowNova> It just won't look the same as your gnome theme

[10:03] <dust> i find kde apps to be abit glitchy-- but maybe i'm just not setting them up right.
[10:04] <ShadowNova> Na, they work fine for me.
[10:04] <dust> well as i said i probably just don't set them up right.
[10:04] <ShadowNova> Maybe.
[10:04] <ShadowNova> Linux never seems to work the same on different computers, lol
[10:05] <Pyru> gnomefreak,  you around?
[10:05] <dust> i would go as far as saying it doesn't work the same way twice on one computer ;)
[10:05] <papillon> Wich OS is better? Ubuntu or WinXP?
[10:05] <ShadowNova> Yeah, that sounds better!
[10:06] <dust> better is a subjective concept-- what are you looking for?

[10:07] <ShadowNova> Pyru, try k3b. Always seems to work for me.
[10:07] <r0xoR> i second a vote for k3b

[10:08] <r0xoR> galo, uhhh i didn't know you asked me that
[10:08] <Pyru> yes
[10:08] <r0xoR> galo, no i don't
[10:08] <ShadowNova> Pyru, Ok, I think k3b is there, let me check.
[10:09] <Pyru> ShadowNova, yes it is
[10:09] <galo> neither do i, but somebody ask for some help and i'm trying now, the problem is the connection is not feet :p
[10:09] <ShadowNova> Pyru, Yeah it is. Open synaptic and run a search for k3b.
[10:09] <Pyru> then I mark k3b for installation?
[10:09] <Ratzilla> are alsa drivers typically used for most audio drivers?
[10:09] <ShadowNova> Pyru, If you've ever used Nero before, it's kinda like that.
[10:09] <ShadowNova> Pyru, yes
[10:10] <Pyru> then what do I do after marking?
[10:10] <ShadowNova> Pyru, it should also install k3blib or something like that
[10:10] <ShadowNova> Pyru, just click 'apply' at the top and it'll do everything for you
[10:11] <ShadowNova> pyru, once that's done, you should find it under Applications>Sound & Video>k3b

[10:31] <zoheb> mlehrer, but itz not :S grrrr
[10:32] <ShadowNova> thanks
[10:32] <hmm> i was working on a ms machine 5 sec. then i desided to erase it and install debian

[10:34] <hmm> <astrisk> what seems to be the problem ?
[10:34] <mish4> you know how in ubuntu, themes are automatically installed
[10:34] <mish4> if i want to edit one of the text files that comes with the theme, where do i find it
[10:34] <mish4> ie: where is the installed theme located
[10:35] <zoheb> mish4, /home/<username>/.themes
[10:35] <mish4> oh and . indicates its hidden
[10:35] <zoheb> mish4, or /root/.themes if u are logged on as root
[10:35] <zoheb> mish4, yep
[10:35] <leojstewart> does anyone know why I can't remove xorg-driver-fglrx??
[10:36] <leojstewart> please, i need help
[10:36] <bk> what's better? gnome or KDE?  I just read an article that has Linus Tovalds recommending KDE, saying it's more efficient.  Is that true?
[10:36] <granden> Hi, on a server where I got told be be serveradmin they are using UTF-8 in the console even through SSH and my terminal dont support UTF-8. So I wonder is there anything in my .bashrc that I can edit to get it to use ISO-8859-1 when I log in?
[10:36] <slvmchn> how do i reset print jobs?
[10:36] <B1zz> I like XFCE its sooooo light :)
[10:36] <dmbt> bk: i prefer gnome
[10:36] <dmbt> just the looks
[10:36] <leojstewart> bk it's all up to opinion
[10:37] <dmbt> and the simplicity
[10:37] <leojstewart> bk i prefer gnome - nice and simple
[10:37] <dmbt> gnome = firefox kde=opera to me
[10:37] <dmbt> well, i mean UI wise
[10:37] <leojstewart> opera = better to me, but gnome = better
[10:37] <njan> opera isn't even part of KDE. It's not even open source.
[10:37] <hmm> <-- just trying to lick his right elbow
[10:37] <leojstewart> opera is pretty awesome though
[10:37] <dmbt> qt/kde apps tend to be more complex
[10:38] <njan> dmbt, true, but they're also better integrated
[10:38] <dmbt> and not following the trend of simplicity in the computer world
[10:38] <granden> I found it it was the LANG variable I was looking for
[10:38] <bk> if anyone wants to read the article, here is the link http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2006/05/taking_a_linuslike_attitude_to.html
[10:38] <dmbt> njan: reminds me of internet explorer :)
[10:38] <njan> dmbt, half the gnome apps have their own method of storing passwords and secrets, usually involving plaintext or at the most base64 encoding
[10:38] <njan> dmbt, gaim and evo both store passwords in stupid, easy to thieve places.
[10:38] <leojstewart> why can't i remove xorg-driver-fglrx??
[10:38] <dmbt> anyway, i don't want to get in a gnome vs kde argument
[10:38] <njan> whereas most everything in KDE for instance integrates with kde-wallet and has passwords stored centrally, encrypted, and protected by a passphrase.
[10:38] <Ratzilla> how can i install audio drivers?
[10:38] <Arrick> anyone, I just installed apache2 on a new server, can someone tell me whether you have to use php in order to use the phpmyadmin graphical user interface?
[10:39] <njan> dmbt, it's not an argument, just points to help the OP decide which he might like better :)
[10:39] <bk> dmbt: i'm not trying to get into an argument.  As a newbie, I want to know what's good.  If the Man is suggesting KDE, I'm thinking of trying it too, but I wanted to know what everyone else uses.
[10:39] <dmbt> njan: there is gnome-keyring
[10:39] <NoUse> Arrick well, its called *php*myadmin for a reason :-)
[10:39] <astrisk> i didnt get what is the problem b'coz when i go to multimedia system selector n then check for the audio output then its coming n still its coming during multimedia system selector check.. but while playin any song no audio output is coming
[10:39] <Aeudian> anyone know what command you can put in the postfix main.cf config to force a reverse dns lookup for mail from:
[10:39] <dmbt> bk: its really up to you
[10:39] <njan> dmbt, there is, but most of the gnome apps don't use it
[10:40] <dmbt> whatever you like better
[10:40] <dmbt> try both of them
[10:40] <erik_m> njan cough gnome cough gnome 8-)
[10:40] <njan> dmbt, evolution is the default gnome mail client and gaim is the default IM client, and neither of them use it
[10:40] <astrisk> hmm,to multimedia system selector n then check for the audio output then its coming n still its coming during multimedia system selector check.. but while playin any song no audio output is coming
[10:40] <njan> dmbt, kmail and kopete, which are the equivalents, both use kde-wallet
[10:40] <senjin> how to you open .rar files i linux?
[10:40] <Arrick> NoUse, I was just making sure
[10:41] <njan> senjin, apt-get install unrar
[10:41] <NoUse> !tell senjin about rar
[10:41] <dmbt> well, i personally use thunderbird for mail, as i hate evolution, and for gaim, no excuses for that
[10:41] <dmbt> i believe thunderbird should be default mail clinet for gnome
[10:41] <astrisk> hmm, i didnt get what is the problem b'coz when i go to multimedia system selector n then check for the audio output then its coming n still its coming during multimedia system selector check.. but while playin any song no audio output is coming
[10:41] <njan> dmbt, it's silly bundling a groupware client and a mail client, which I think is why kde comes with evo and thunderbird
[10:41] <njan> dmbt, there isn't enough space on a 650mb CD for two mail clients
[10:42] <mysta> hello is it possible to check my grub menu after already loggin in?
[10:42] <dmbt> once xulrunner support is finished, it should be only a couple megs for each new mozilla based program
[10:43] <njan> mysta, the configuration file is in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:43] <hmm> <astrisk> http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#codecs !!its unofficial but mostly works :)
[10:43] <njan> mysta, which lets you see what options are there..
[10:44] <swim> hey folks, is there a net install iso for dapper?
[10:44] <erik_m> dmbt i fully agree that by the time their bundling firefox i think thunderbird should be default in gnome!
[10:45] <gnomefreak> !ubuntuguide
[10:45] <ubotu> from memory, ubuntuguide is badly out of date,  reported to break a lot and generally a bad source for information. Use help.ubuntu.com or wiki.ubuntu.com instead.
[10:45] <gnomefreak> hmm: dont ever advise that
[10:46] <erik_m> hmm try the wiki , its far better ;D
[10:46] <Mysta_> thanks njan!
[10:46] <Ratzilla> i have a problem with my wireless...it seems to work when I'm at school but at home..it doesnt...i can see my router but when it wont connect properly
[10:46] <Ratzilla> anyone have an idea?
[10:46] <swim> anyone ?
[10:46] <acke> You guys know if ubuntu is for architecture intel core duo??
[10:47] <erik_m> Ratzilla ubuntu 5.10 yes ?
[10:47] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yes 5.10
[10:47] <Spec> acke: you're asking if ubuntu will work on a dual core intel processor?
[10:47] <erik_m> Ratzilla is ur home network get a dhcp setup ?
[10:47] <dmbt> acke: yes, it will work, but once you install it, woull want to switch to a smp kernel
[10:47] <dmbt> to take advantage of both cores
[10:48] <swim> is there a net install iso for dapper?
[10:48] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yes its DHCP, i also have the wep key which i entered too
[10:48] <gnomefreak> !netinstall
[10:48] <hmm> okidoki
[10:48] <ubotu> I guess netinstall is To install Ubuntu via the net, try here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75372 ... Breezy netboot CD image: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
[10:49] <erik_m> and the school network is dhcp too ?
[10:49] <Ratzilla> erik_m: im actually not sure...i think so
=== r0bby___ is now known as r0bby_
[10:49] <astrisk> hmm, ok thnx
[10:50] <swim> ubotu, is there a dapper mini.iso? do you know?
[10:50] <ubotu> Syntax error in line 1. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, swim
[10:50] <Ratzilla> erik_m: it just connects automatically and then you login with a browser so there's no requirement for a wep key
[10:50] <erik_m> Ratzilla: go to system (top) then admin then networks
[10:50] <gnomefreak> swim: yes
[10:50] <bkeating> My ProxyRequest / ProxyPass directives are broke, do i need to enable a module other then proxy_html.load to get it to work?
[10:50] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell swim about netinstall
[10:50] <gnomefreak> swim: read your pm
[10:51] <hmm> but its really not that bad :)
[10:51] <erik_m> Ratzilla: then click on ur wireless then properties
[10:51] <swim> gnomefreak, seems to say its a breezy mini.iso (the pm)
[10:51] <Ratzilla> erik_m: it goes activating interfacve "eth1" but it doesnt end...after a few mins, it'll stop and then say that the device is active..although it wont work
[10:52] <gnomefreak> swim: yes this is the breezy channel im thinking there is one for dapper but maybe not
[10:52] <Madpilot> would someone remind me how to use a .run file? I'm having a noob moment...
[10:52] <bkeating> How do i get proxying to work like normal in apache2 ubuntu? i can confirm that proxy_html.load is already loaded
[10:52] <swim> gnomefreak, http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ seems to have one
[10:52] <erik_m> Ratzilla: ok u know the IP of ur router/gateway ?
[10:52] <gnomefreak> swim: ok there you go
[10:52] <swim> thx
[10:53] <kismet> Hi All! Do you know where can I find more stencil for KIVIO, OpenOffice Draw and/or DIA?
[10:53] <rockdonus> hi i was messign with loadkeys and now when i hit ^ i have to hit it twice
[10:53] <rockdonus> im using loadkeys us, how to get it back to how i just have to hit ^ once?
[10:53] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yeah i do
[10:53] <rockdonus> same goes for apostrophe
[10:53] <Dex-Freudii> hi
[10:53] <swim> whats the dapper channel?
[10:53] <rockdonus> and quotation mark
[10:53] <Mysta_> #ubuntu+1
[10:53] <erik_m> ok in the networking window , go to the DNS tab , is it in the top list ? if not add ur router/gateway ip to it :)
[10:54] <Tristian> hey folks
[10:54] <Mysta_> hello
[10:54] <Dex-Freudii> Printing problem: I was printing something and I switched my printer off, and then cancelled the printing job. Afterwards I switch my printer on and it keeps on printing (now, special chars)... I can't stop it... what can I do?
[10:54] <Tristian> turn it off at the wall and leave it for a while
[10:54] <Dex-Freudii> it's been off for two hours
[10:55] <Tristian> hell knows then.. printers suck
[10:55] <mish4> so everything that the user installs will be installed to /home/.whatever ?
[10:55] <Tristian> no...
[10:55] <hmm> prob, with original ubunto guide is, that it is difficult to find it :p guess it would cost to much to buy of the http://ubuntuguide.org/ address hehe
[10:55] <erik_m> Ratzilla: u find the DNS bit ?
[10:55] <gnomefreak> mish4: no
[10:55] <mish4> okay. guess my logic was wrong
[10:55] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yeah, its processing
[10:55] <Michael`123> Anyone have any suggestions for my question here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1037174#post1037174 ? (I have asked in here 3-4 times, none of which have I found an answer...don't really want to repeat it all again)
[10:55] <gnomefreak> it never touches /home unless you download it manully and place it there
[10:55] <Tristian> applications are kept in /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin etc...
[10:55] <Madpilot> hmm, ubuntuguide is badly out of date. Use wiki.ubuntu.com or help.ubuntu.com instead
[10:56] <erik_m> Ratzilla:  did u need to add it to the DNS list ?
[10:56] <Dex-Freudii> Tristian, it's like /dev/printer queue is not empty
[10:56] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yeah i did, should i disconnect my cable and see if it works?
[10:56] <Kater`> Hi, could somebody assist me with configuring my wlan? I'm starting to become a bit desperate ...
[10:56] <galo> hi again, i've installed java-sun but always i have to access to a web with java the button to install the plugin appears... always tells to install java plugin, but it fails and suggest me to install it manual (what i did). i run the test page from sun and it seems to work, but i cant run sites with jave as http://www.numion.com/YourSpeed3/Run.php?QuickStart=SelectDefaults to know my speed. plase somebody can help ? thanks for your time
[10:56] <erik_m> Ratzilla:  cause that may be the problem with it , certainly worth a try :)
[10:57] <Ratzilla> erik_m: okay :) ill disconnect my cable and see if it works
[10:57] <Madpilot> galo, you need to make sure your system is actually using Sun Java. See the RestrictedFormats page on the wiki.
[10:57] <hmm> yeah but www.ubuntuguide.org makes more sense and is easy to find, i am applying to the domain name :p
[10:57] <Madpilot> hmm, yeah, it's a good URL - too bad the info on it isn't good anymore
[10:58] <hmm> helped me out sometimes
[11:00] <hmm> okay okay, but u have to admire the easy structure of the page, sorry but i had a look at the official guides :(
[11:00] <hmm> no good for noobs
[11:00] <zack> how can i make it so i can see the files from another hardrive that has windows on it
[11:01] <erik_m> hmm i know what u mean about the structure although the wiki is very easy to use!
[11:01] <hmm> type ubuntu guide into google then u know what i mean
[11:01] <hmm> :)
[11:01] <visik7> anyone got an asus V6J ?
[11:01] <Madpilot> hmm, the guides for Dapper have been much improved - have a look at http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html - if you've got suggestions, join #ubuntu-doc
[11:02] <gnomefreak> Madpilot: sorry he had to leave :(
[11:02] <Kater`> I installed the broadcom drivers, the net config thingy found my network bit I didn't get a dhcp adress, switched my wlan to non-protected, still no dhcp, used a static ip, windows machine could ping laptop but not the other way around, i tried kismet and airsnort to check if the network worked but now i can't modprobe ndiswrapper anymore ... help please?
[11:02] <TheBigToe> WORK YOU SOUND IN SWFS
[11:02] <zack> i have another hard drive hooked up with windows on it. how can i view the files?
[11:02] <hmm> hello again
[11:02] <HymnToLife> !caps
[11:02] <ubotu> FYI, typing in ALL CAPS is considered to be 'yelling', and therefore rude behaviour.
[11:02] <astrisk> hmm, thnx i got my sound back
[11:02] <Madpilot> hmm, the guides for Dapper have been much improved - have a look at http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html - if you've got suggestions, join #ubuntu-doc
[11:03] <hmm> cool
[11:03] <dakira> hi.. has anyone tried Xgl/Compiz with KDE?
[11:03] <TheBigToe> I don't care about yelling, I've been trying to fix this issue for a week now
[11:03] <bobbyd> hi
[11:03] <bobbyd> is there any way to just take a video file and make a VCD?
[11:03] <Tristian> I want Xgl
[11:03] <zack> i have another hard drive hooked up with windows on it. how can i view the files?
[11:04] <gnomefreak> Tristian: get dapper than

[11:04] <zack> bobbyd thanks
[11:05] <Tristian> downloading Ubuntu now for my laptop and I just hope I get ndiswrapper working
[11:05] <gnomefreak> Madpilot: that does look alot better than the breezy guide i remember
[11:05] <[NP] Tangent> Tristian
[11:05] <[NP] Tangent> I have Ubuntu on my laptop as of last night
[11:05] <zack> bobbyd do i have to make the directory /mnt/windows ?
[11:05] <[NP] Tangent> and my wireless already works
[11:06] <hmm> someone know how to set up a anonym proxy server
[11:06] <Ratzilla> erik_m: hey, it didnt work x.x it said that it was "disconnected"
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> so you shouldn't have too much trouble
[11:06] <Tristian> ok...
[11:06] <bobbyd> zack, you need to make the /mnt/windows dir and use cfdisk /dev/hda or hdb or hdc to see if you can find the windows partition
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> if I can get it to work...
[11:06] <Tristian> I'm used to Fedora you see
[11:06] <Madpilot> gnomefreak, yeah, we basically rewrote the entire Desktop Guide for Dapper - there's a new guide for Kubuntu & one for Xubuntu as well
[11:06] <zack> bobbyd thanks
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> what card you have?
[11:06] <bobbyd> zack, although maybe ubuntu can do that for you automatically
[11:06] <mathieu> [NP] Tangent: it depends which hardware you have.. you can't speak it general like that
[11:06] <gnomefreak> sweet
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> yeah, I know, mathieu
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> but see, things I touch like to break
[11:06] <[NP] Tangent> not function
[11:07] <Tristian> edimax ew-7108pcg
[11:07] <gnomefreak> i see doc team has been hard at work ;)
[11:07] <bobbyd> zack, in KDE I can just add it in system settings->disk & filesystems
[11:07] <erik_m> Ratzilla : hmmm u try open a webpage ?
[11:07] <hmm> ;)
[11:07] <Ratzilla> erik_m: yeah i did, it wouldnt connect
[11:07] <hmm> brb
[11:07] <bobbyd> zack, don't know how to do that in Gnome though
[11:07] <erik_m> ok open a terminal window and type ifconfig eth1
[11:07] <zack> bobbyd ok thanks it works now
[11:07] <erik_m> Ratzilla :  im gueswsing its eth1 lol
[11:08] <bobbyd> zack, cool, if it's NTFS you won't be able to write to it by default, that is possible though
[11:08] <cytrak> anyone knows a CD distro based on ubuntu ? that may have openvpn already as part of it ?
[11:08] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: not safely its not
[11:08] <NoUse> bobbyd but not safe
[11:08] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, yes it is, I'm not talking about the standard driver
[11:08] <NoUse> !captive
[11:08] <ubotu> somebody said captive was a project to use windows NTFS drivers under linux. It does not work properly with Ubuntu.
[11:08] <cytrak> if not a part of it already , the posibility I can modify it to add openvpn
[11:08] <gnomefreak> no its not bobbyd ntfs write support is not there because its not safe
[11:09] <aLPHa_LeaK> n8
[11:09] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/
[11:09] <Ratzilla> erik_m: are ipw2200 drivers installed with 5.10 by default?
[11:09] <NoUse> !tell bobbyd about captive
[11:09] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: captive _isnt_ safe
[11:09] <Arrick> is php hard to use?
[11:09] <sqdsfdgreag> df
[11:09] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, maybe not under ubuntu...
[11:09] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: this is not a debate there is no such thing as safe writing to ntfs
[11:09] <sqdsfdgreag> no
[11:10] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, of course there is, run windows under linux :)
[11:10] <Madpilot> Kater`, why not just ask your question again, rather than complaining about feeling ignored...?
[11:10] <Arrick> bobbyd, you should consider a fat file then
[11:10] <Tristian> Use Qemu to install Windows on GNU/Linux
[11:10] <erik_m> ratzilla i dont think they are but theres a guide on the ubuntu forums about it
[11:11] <Kater`> Madpilot because the question was multiple lines long and repeating it could easily be seen as spam
[11:11] <Kater`> but i'll repeat then
[11:11] <hmm> hello
[11:11] <Kater`> I installed the broadcom drivers, the net config thingy found my network bit I didn't get a dhcp adress, switched my wlan to non-protected, still no dhcp, used a static ip, windows machine could ping laptop but not the other way around, i tried kismet and airsnort to check if the network worked but now i can't modprobe ndiswrapper anymore ... help please?
[11:11] <zack> when i try the command cp /folder/ /home/zack/folder2 it says cp: ommiting directory 'folder'
[11:11] <mathieu> zack: cp -r
[11:11] <zack> mathieu thanks
[11:11] <aquo> hi
[11:11] <mathieu> cp will only copy files by default
[11:11] <Arrick> hola
[11:12] <cytrak> no ubuntu bootable cd distro ?
[11:12] <aquo> will dapper drake install cd have support for cryptsetup-luks
[11:12] <linardy> hello all
[11:12] <Arrick> yes there is cytrak
[11:12] <gnomefreak> cytrak: what do you mean all the iso's are bootable
[11:12] <linardy> anyone know how to stop cron from sending messages?
[11:12] <Arrick> called liveCD
[11:12] <hmm> <cytrak> u can even order then for free no cost at all
[11:12] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, captive seems to work for some people as there are testimonials on the website saying it works...
[11:12] <Arrick> yep
[11:12] <gnomefreak> Arrick: not much longer :(
[11:12] <cytrak> ubuntu running from a CD only
[11:12] <Arrick> there will be for me
[11:13] <amphi> linardy: sending messages?
[11:13] <Arrick> I have 50 copies here
[11:13] <ubuntu> 
[11:13] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: are you gonna be here to put their data back on their pc and fix it when it doesnt work for them?
[11:13] <hmm> <cytrak> i got 20 copies of ubuntu live-cd and installer cds
[11:13] <linardy> emails
[11:13] <linardy> or, sys messages to qmail
[11:13] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, um, no?
[11:13] <linardy> I thought
[11:13] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: than dont suggest it since it is not safe
[11:13] <cytrak> Can the live CD be modified and recreated ?
[11:13] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, I'll suggest what I like, people can make their own decisions
[11:13] <NoUse> !tell cytrak about livecd
[11:14] <hmm> dunno :)
[11:14] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: im asking you nicely please dont suggest that in here
[11:14] <HymnToLife> cytrak> use *noppix, it's designed for that
[11:14] <hmm> yes i do but cant be botherd

[11:16] <bobbyd> gnomefreak, I'll suggest what I think is appropriate. I didn't say it was foolproof, just that it was possible.

[11:16] <amphi> linardy: I don't have a message from here atm, but it's pretty clear if it was sent by cron
[11:16] <aquo> ubuntu livecd doesn't support cryptsetup, so i can't use dm-crypt ...

[11:18] <gnomefreak> bobbyd: i asked you not to suggest it for anyreadon in this channel
[11:18] <aquo> i am so glad that atheros madwifi is supported now, but i need cryptsetup-luks too
[11:18] <gnomefreak> im gonna ask you to please cool it now
[11:18] <octan> howdy all
[11:18] <Arrick> hey gnomefreak you cant even get ubuntu from shippit now?
[11:18] <visik7> aquo: I never tried dm-crypt how much does it overload the system ?

[11:19] <Arrick> not on the site
[11:19] <Arrick> dapper
[11:19] <gnomefreak> Arrick: they are taking orders for dapper
[11:19] <gnomefreak> i ordered them
[11:19] <Madpilot> Arrick, they're not shipping right now, but they're taking orders for Dapper
[11:19] <amphi> linardy: is it an error? cron doesn't email to say "I just did what I was supposed to" in my experience
[11:19] <Arrick> oh ok

[11:19] <octan> how do i fix it
[11:20] <aquo> visik7: depends on chiper, key-length and several other parameters (atime-logging for example) ... i think it ist 15-20% on my pentium-3 1.13
[11:20] <Spec> I need 2000 cds in a month or so... :)
[11:20] <gnomefreak> octan: type about:config in the address bar of firefox and see if flash is listed in there

[11:20] <linardy> no errors

[11:22] <visik7> aquo: do you know other crypto device (possibly not integrated into the core ?
[11:22] <gnomefreak> Spec: i dont think flood would take that
[11:22] <hmm> yeah like some spanking
[11:22] <acke> Hey, does ubuntu support intel core duo?? and what architecture should I choose for the install?
[11:22] <hmm> giveme
[11:22] <B1zz> geez how long does it take you to make that :-p
[11:22] <hmm> hehe
[11:22] <Spec> Madpilot: i was half-way joking -- I do need the cds, but I think someone else is taking care of it :p
[11:22] <aquo> visik7: i don't know about other crypt-devices that are freely available
[11:22] <octan> gnomefreak is the name exaxctly flash?
[11:22] <visik7> acke: core duo has nothing special a part from be a dual proc linux support dual processor since ages
[11:22] <gnomefreak> octan: you should see flash enabled in there
[11:23] <acke> visik7 oooh o.O
[11:23] <dakira> octan: it's something with flashplayer in it..
[11:23] <acke> visik7 so i pick a regular i86 arch. for the duo core for my laptop?
[11:23] <eugman> Is there a reason why a normal user might need  good randomness? I was thinking of installing and using reseed if so.
[11:23] <dakira> mine is flashplayer-nonfree from an unofficial repository
[11:23] <visik7> acke: yes
[11:23] <gnomefreak> octan: it should be flash-nonfree
[11:23] <acke> visik7ooh thanks
[11:24] <octan> i dont see it
[11:24] <octan> odd
[11:24] <acke> visik7 yeah now that i remember. i tried the i86 live ubuntu cd. ,,,, dont work
[11:24] <amphi> eugman: gpg
[11:24] <mwe> eugman: not in the general case I think
[11:24] <dakira> octan.. add extra repositories
[11:24] <gnomefreak> dakira: he had it to start with
[11:24] <visik7> acke: dunno
[11:24] <visik7> acke: what laptop ?
[11:24] <gnomefreak> octan: are you on breezy?
[11:24] <acke> visik7so would an install work ?
[11:24] <mwe> eugman: time is a pretty good seed in most cases
[11:24] <visik7> acke: dunno even what laptop u have
[11:25] <amphi> linardy: how odd - you're sure it's not compaining about something?
[11:25] <octan> <gnomefreak> dapper
[11:25] <dakira> gnomefreak: oh
[11:25] <octan> gnomefreak its installed according to synaptic
[11:25] <eugman> amphi, in what cases would I need a gpg key?
[11:25] <gnomefreak> octan: join #ubuntu+1 and they have been having issues with flash
[11:25] <amphi> linardy: you could look at /etc/cron*
[11:25] <linardy> sure
[11:25] <spundun> hi all.... I am looking for the most user friendly path from a dv/firewire camcorder to a linuxbox->edit to a video dvd ....what would you reccommend? I need to advise a friend (smart but not up to date with linux)
[11:25] <visik7> acke: so ?
[11:26] <acke> visik7 acer tm 4674
[11:26] <amphi> eugman: mail encryption, mail signing? but /dev/random should be ok, it's just /dev/urandom that's not overly random
[11:26] <visik7> oh a crappy acer
[11:26] <acke> visik7yeah
[11:26] <Blissex> spundun: there are books and online tutorials/HOWTOs on that. However DV to PC under Linux is easy (the 1394 drivers), editing is OKish, creating a DVD video can be complex because DVD videos are complex.
[11:26] <dust> so here's the  story: i'm setting up nvidia twinview and/or tvout, in the wiki it tells me to set the meta modes to things like 800x600, 800x600, (one set for each monitor?) but what if you want the monitors to have different resolutions can you 640x480, 800x600?
[11:27] <Spec> GPG will not use /dev/urandom, using /dev/random is hardcoded into GPG
[11:27] <linardy> got cron
[11:27] <bobbyd> spundun, kino
[11:27] <Spec> , /dev/urandom isn't random enough for good encryption
[11:27] <linchris> is there anything between breezy and dapper?
[11:27] <Spec> linchris: no
[11:27] <gnomefreak> linchris: no
[11:27] <linchris> ok
[11:27] <linchris> ..
[11:27] <amphi> Spec: yeah, that's what I was saying
[11:27] <visik7> acke: personally I hate acer they broke things and make life of a linux user an pain in the ass
[11:27] <Blissex> spundun: check out the IEEE1394, Video4Linux and various other projects...
[11:27] <mwe> eugman: people trying to crack your encryption would have a _really_ hard time even if you use /dev/urandom I think
[11:28] <Spec> visik7: my acer laptop works 100%
[11:28] <visik7> Spec: good for you
[11:28] <amphi> Spec: he was taling about installing some other PRNG, as I understood, and /dev/random should be good enough
[11:28] <bobbyd> spundun, and maybe cinelerra if he wants to do lots of editing
[11:28] <CyaniCs> blah... keep having problems with kubuntu
[11:28] <Spec> visik7: many laptops i've tried that have sucked with linux, just sayin, my experience with acer is good
=== CyaniCs is now known as CyaniCs|Testing
[11:28] <overridex> for browsing windows share networks in natuilus, how do i change the workgroup name to look for?
[11:28] <Spec> amphi: oh
[11:28] <komisch> opps! i did it again!
[11:28] <komisch> hehe
[11:28] <dust> and does anyone know where a full list of nvidia 'option' lines *with descriptions* can be found?
[11:29] <Spec> oh, /dev/random is a good PRNG
[11:29] <acke> visik7 yeah im actually running ubuntu on my old acer tm 370 and it works like a charm
[11:29] <Spec> if you're going to do anything, get a TRNG
[11:29] <komisch> no ban can hold me back

[11:29] <johan_> hey the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor 0.3.1 does not work as in i can't select the actual speed
[11:29] <haakonn> what is the simplest way to set up a caching dns server on my system, which is only available locally?
[11:29] <komisch> :p
[11:29] <spundun> bobbyd: so kino and cinelerra take care of importing and editing... so how do I burn a video dvd? any software that does that?
[11:30] <johan_> and it's locked at 1ghz
[11:30] <bobbyd> hackel, install bind?
[11:30] <amphi> haakonn: dnsmasq is a caching dns forwarder, if that's all you want
[11:30] <bobbyd> spundun, k3b? maybe dvd::rip
[11:30] <visik7> acke: spec: yes on many acer works well but try to search "acer linux dsdt" on google and you understand why I hate acer
[11:30] <haakonn> amphi:  sounds right, thanks
[11:30] <amphi> haakonn: apt-cache show dnsmasq will give you some info
[11:31] <Spec> dsdt?
[11:31] <spundun> bobbyd: dvd:rip? I want to burn :)

[11:31] <dust> can any help with nvidia options?
[11:31] <Spec> What's it used for?
[11:32] <visik7> amphi: I haven't an acer, but helped many friends of mine to fix that crap
[11:32] <Spec> and how does dsdt affect an acer system?
[11:32] <bkeating> why hasn't MySQL received updates? we're still on 4.0.x???!!!
[11:32] <visik7> Spec: practically acpi will not work
[11:32] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell bkeating about timetable
[11:32] <visik7> no temperature no battery no speedstep nothing
[11:32] <Spec> hmm, i didn't touch dsdt and my acpi works, it monitors battery life and thermal temperature just fine...
[11:33] <Spec> so, only some acer systems?
[11:33] <spundun> bobbyd: cool.... thanks a lot!
[11:33] <visik7> Spec: the problem doesn't affect all acer
[11:33] <Spec> ah, k
[11:33] <Spec> well, yeah, that'd be a bitch then :p
[11:33] <amphi> visik7: loads of errors trying to recompile it?
[11:33] <visik7> amphi: sorry ?
[11:33] <Madpilot> bkeating, see the PM you just got from the bot
[11:33] <bobbyd> spundun, np. kino is simple, cinelerra is complex and powerful (and usually a pita to get working properly :)
[11:34] <amphi> visik7: the dsdt on the acer on which acpi was completely broken
[11:34] <visik7> amphi: ... yes
[11:35] <spundun> hmmm.... I wish there was some kinda simple task flow here, where when you  plugin a camcorder it will ask you if you want to import the video, once you import it will ask if you want to edit it... and the editor has a button which will launch the video in a dvd burning utility... with the right resolution and all...
[11:36] <spundun> bobbyd: kinda like iMovie and iDVD
[11:36] <bkeating> Madpilot: thanks for the headsup, but this is a 3rd party package, something a porter is responsible for, they (cna) release updates daily, don't they?
[11:36] <bobbyd> spundun, maybe :)
[11:36] <amphi> visik7: could you correct them? I mucked about with my dsdt, just out of curiosity, but it compiled without error
[11:36] <g0dchild> Is there a way to get a scrnshot of a text terminal?
[11:37] <visik7> amphi: I've corrected some of them following guides found on internet
[11:37] <TokenBad> in ubuntu...k3b if I wanted to burn an mp3 disk to play in a mp3 player would i need to just burn a data disk?
[11:37] <amphi> visik7: cool - did some things then work?
[11:38] <Madpilot> bkeating, probably not. You could ask on #ubutu-devel if you want more information, though...

[11:40] <mwe> g0dchild: I don't think you can get a true screenshot easily, but you can get all the text there. I don't remember exactly how though

[11:58] <mikomiko> I dont know why playing youtube seems to be harder the second time around
[11:58] <mikomiko> at first, it plays alright
[11:58] <mikomiko> but on the second attempt, i can no longer hear no sounds
[11:59] <Knorrie> Old: try to read some documentation, basic stuff about how unix users and permissions work
[11:59] <zack> arrick, in root i would type chmod /folder/ ??
[12:00] <teletubbie> !mp3
[12:00] <ubotu> hmm... mp3 is a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[12:00] <Arrick> heck no
[12:00] <Arrick> you should own all folders as root
[12:00] <Arrick> why are you in root?
[12:00] <Arrick> !root
[12:00] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[12:01] <zack> arrick ok nevermind that whats the command i would use
[12:01] <Arrick> ok
[12:01] <Arrick> zack, you could log in regular and type sudo before it

[12:02] <Arrick> yeah
[12:03] <Michael`123> Nice, nice. In a suburb of the Twin Cities myself.
[12:03] <Madpilot> Michael`123 & Arrick - #ubuntu-offtopic if you just want to chat, thanks
[12:03] <Arrick> chmod +r if i remember correctly

[12:04] <Madpilot> not sure. man chmod should help....
[12:04] <Michael`123> Anyway, I was wondering -- I installed Ubuntu, I opted to install GRUB, and yet it doesn't seem to install. No errors, nothing. I tried "sudo grub-install /dev/sda" with a Live CD and it did not work. I quoted a ton of things in this forum thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1037174#post1037174 -- Any ideas?
[12:05] <erik_m> All: im sharing a internet connection from a ubuntu computer and that works , but i was wondering how i can forward ports ?
[12:05] <zack> arrick, what about for chgrp? what would i type after chgrp and before the folder ?
[12:05] <Old> mwe, what's the command to give the user "musenftp" access to everything in /var/www/cstrike/ ? Im using proftpd
[12:05] <Arrick> sudo chgrp admin -R /blah/blah
[12:05] <Arrick> but as root leave out the sudi

[12:06] <zack> arrick i cant see the folders
[12:06] <Michael`123> I have asked in here about 4 or 5 times in the last few days, haven't really gotten any help =\
[12:06] <teletubbie> !p2p
[12:06] <ubotu> methinks p2p is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/P2PHowTo
[12:06] <Old> Arrick, who are you talking to ?
[12:06] <Isyth> I was hoping someone might be able to help me, I'm having some trouble typing in other languages-- specifically Arabic.
[12:06] <Arrick> Michael`123, when it asked you if you wanted to install grub on the mbr what did you tell it?
[12:06] <Old> Arrick, was that for me ?
[12:07] <Michael`123> Arrick, I selected "Yes"
[12:07] <Arrick> zack go to terminal and type ls
[12:07] <Old> ..
[12:07] <Arrick> then cd to the next step
[12:07] <Arrick> then ls
[12:07] <Arrick> Old, hang tight k?
[12:07] <Michael`123> Arrick, It said it was "Running grub-install (hd0)" or something, then it said installation was complete, and I should reboot my computer...GRUB never appears (Note that it did say WinXP was detected)
[12:07] <zack> arrick i mean in the file browser i can see the folders
[12:08] <Arrick> oh ok
[12:08] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: on that screen is wher eyou would choose where grub was to be placed
[12:08] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: rebooting should now give you a grub menu
[12:08] <Arrick> gnomefreak, it didnt
[12:08] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, I have rebooted like 10 times since installing
[12:09] <miranda82> hello everyone
[12:09] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, and I have reinstalled Ubuntu about 3 times, and ran grub-install, as well as that config-grub command or whatever it is
[12:09] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: what if you hit the esc key when grub is supposed to appear
[12:09] <amphi> Michael`123: did you tell it to install grub to the mbr, or a partition?
[12:10] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, Tried that, but I checked with LiveCD and the grub menu.lst file does not even exist
[12:10] <gnomefreak> does it atleast say grub 1.5 during reboot at any time?
[12:10] <erik_m> Michael`123: sry i havent kept along with this through , what loads when u boot ur computer (instead of grub?)
[12:10] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: hmmmmmmmm
[12:10] <Michael`123> amphi, In the past it always asked me with Debian, but on the Ubuntu installation it just asks "Do you want to install it to the MBR" -- yes or no, it didn't ask whether to install to partition or MBR
[12:10] <gnomefreak> thats strange
=== Kater` is now known as kater`
[12:10] <Michael`123> erik_m, Dual boot with WinXP/Ubuntu, WinXP loads, GRUB does not display
[12:11] <Arrick> Old, can you join #arrick with your question, these guys got the other two under control
[12:11] <erik_m> Michael`123: i think you can get windows to have a boot selector ? might be easier
[12:11] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: and ubuntu was installed after xp?
[12:11] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, I don't know if I am allowed to refer to it, but I did post on the Ubuntu Forums and I posted a ton of extra information and config files, etc: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1037174#post1037174
[12:11] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, Correct
[12:11] <amphi> Michael`123: and you told it to install to the mbr?
[12:11] <Michael`123> amphi, Yes.
[12:12] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: im half attempted to say try installing ubuntu again and place grub on mbr
[12:12] <erik_m> michael'123 http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-1097.html
[12:12] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, As noted, I have tried reinstalling Ubuntu to make sure I didn't miss something 3 times, but to no avail. All it says is "Ubuntu detected another operating system: Windows XP......Would you like to install GRUB to the MBR?" (Yes or no), and every time I select YES
[12:13] <erik_m> Michael`123 altering the windows xp boot menu isnt a prefered method but might be alot easier , xp realy doesnt want to give up booting lol
[12:13] <amphi> Michael`123: and what happens when you boot?
[12:13] <nss29> Can anyone help me with alsa?
[12:13] <Michael`123> amphi, WinXP just loads, esc key doesn't help at all
[12:13] <teletubbie> finally got mp3 playing
[12:13] <teletubbie> :)
[12:14] <Michael`123> erik_m, Sorry, forgot to respond to your message. I haven't ever used that, always have used GRUB/LILO
[12:14] <amphi> Michael`123: you don't have some 'anti-virus' write protect the mbr thing on in the bios? some bioses have such a thing
[12:14] <gnomefreak> maybe bad iso?
[12:14] <Obst> hi dudes
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[12:14] <Obst> is dapper stable?
[12:14] <erik_m> Michael`123 : might be worth a shot instead ?
[12:14] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, It is off the disk that you can get Ubuntu to mail you
[12:15] <Michael`123> amphi, I can't remember if I have ever gotten a dual boot set up on this new machine...that's possible
[12:15] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: that doesnt mean that the md5sum is good
[12:15] <Michael`123> erik_m, Eh, I suppose I could look into that
[12:15] <nss29> Can the chip be changed in alsamixer???
[12:16] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, But what are the chances of Ubuntu mailing out thousands of invalid distros?
[12:16] <amphi> Michael`123: might be worth a look; it's odd that grub seems to completely fail to write to the mbr
[12:17] <mysta> Michael'123 I had issues w/ my Ubuntu CD from ShipIT as well, and after searching the forums, it seems many others did as well
[12:17] <Michael`123> amphi, grub-install just says: ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub-install /dev/sda
[12:17] <Michael`123> Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time.
[12:17] <Michael`123> /dev/mapper/casper-snapshot does not have any corresponding BIOS drive.
[12:17] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: out of ten only 3 worked
[12:17] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: please dont paste in here
[12:18] <Michael`123> Sorry.
[12:18] <erik_m> michael'123 as i say its not prefered but its an option , heres another page about it if needed http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2006/05/08/dual-boot-laptop.html?page=last&x-showcontent=text

[12:19] <gnomefreak> maybe that will help?
[12:19] <mysta> michael'123 I'd make sure you burn a extremely low speed. I burned mine @ 4x
[12:19] <Michael`123> gnomefreak, Been to the first link, second isn't really relevant, the third might be helpful
[12:19] <Michael`123> mysta, Why is that?
[12:20] <mysta> bad sectors, and corrupt data if you burn @ higher speeds
[12:20] <gnomefreak> Michael`123: it wont burn right at a high speed safest to go with lowest
[12:21] <Michael`123> Oh, I see. Alright, thanks everyone! I don't see my error from grub-install on that one page. I will try downloading the distro, installing, and if that doesn't work I will look into the BIOS, and then I will try the WinXP dual boot thing
[12:21] <Michael`123> Thanks again!
[12:21] <vladuz976> is there anything similar to autocad available for linux

[12:45] <nry> hi ppl
[12:45] <Madpilot> evoldoer, I've only ever used other people's torrents, and peered them. After I opened Firestarter it's worked just fine - not sure I can help you further...
[12:45] <sh3l1> gay! |/gay
[12:45] <amphi> Drac[Server] : you can do it manually with dhclient <iface>
[12:45] <Drac[Server] > amphi: I know. Thanks, though.
[12:45] <zack> i cant change the permissions of a folder how do i change it in terminal?
[12:45] <erik_m> madpilot amphi u know any guides manual ? cause i screwed up a iptales b4 lol
[12:45] <cubikdice> w00t, new install of Ubuntu
[12:46] <evoldoer> thats ok, I've searched the forum and went to the firestarter site, I think it might be that firestarter is broken
[12:46] <soundray> zack: with chmod (maybe sudo chmod)
[12:46] <sh3l1> {
[12:46] <Madpilot> erik_m, not offhand. I always just use Firestarter...
[12:46] <Xbox_guru> how do I install a tar.gz file
[12:46] <amphi> erik_m: netfilter.org has the definitive docs
[12:46] <thoreauputic> zack: chmod. chown
[12:46] <soundray> zack: you might also try 'gksudo nautilus'
[12:46] <zack> what is chown?
[12:46] <amphi> erik_m: man iptables is useful, but no tutorial
[12:46] <amphi> zack: man chown ;_
[12:46] <skiman> cows are cool i think
[12:46] <thoreauputic> zack: change owner
[12:46] <erik_m> amphi madpilot cheers will check it all out :D
[12:46] <MENDIGO> I can watch dvds in my PC!! it the audio and video keeps locking and releasing.. =/
[12:46] <zack> ok
[12:46] <cubikdice> skiman, i like cows too
[12:46] <nry> I want to know how to copy an mp3 in terminal window
[12:47] <soundray> zack: enter 'man chown' on the command line. It'll explain itself. Try the same with 'man chmod'
[12:47] <sh3l1> cubikdice, you are gay, like anal sex with other men
[12:47] <skiman> thats mean
[12:47] <amphi> MENDIGO: you are using the xv driver? if not [sure] , try mplayer -vo xv dvd://[n]

[12:48] <thoreauputic> amphi: heh
[12:48] <MENDIGO> amphi, i have to type it everytime ?
[12:48] <thoreauputic> amphi: I was dragooned intothe service last year
[12:49] <thoreauputic> ;)
[12:49] <amphi> MENDIGO: do 'echo vo=xv >> ~/.mplayer/config' and you won't have to type it again

[12:50] <Xbox_guru> hey amphi, remember me with the sound problem? I opened up my computer and found that my sound is directly connected to my motherboard
[12:50] <amphi> thoreauputic: congrats - I look forward to news of your promotion to First Sea Lord ;)
[12:50] <evoldoer> Question: what game on linux do you find yourself addicted to?
[12:50] <cubikdice> lol
[12:50] <Xbox_guru> its not in a pci slot
[12:50] <Kyral> evoldoer: Nethack
[12:50] <amphi> Xbox_guru: connected to the mobo?? better disconnect it ;)
[12:50] <soundray> evoldoer: #ubuntu-de-quiz :)
[12:51] <scottt106> is there something i need to install to use the "make" command?
[12:51] <thoreauputic> amphi: for that you need to have a receding chin and a plum in your mouth, do you not ? ;-)
[12:51] <soundray> !b-e
[12:51] <ubotu> or if you get errors saying gcc cannot create executables, or that you can't find header files like stdio.h, or get "make: command not found, then you need to do a    sudo apt-get install build-essential.
[12:51] <Xbox_guru> amphi, 'd have to cut it off
[12:51] <evoldoer> oh thanks
[12:51] <evoldoer> sorry, I am a newb on this chan
[12:51] <soundray> scottt106: did you see that?
[12:51] <amphi> Xbox_guru: lspci doesn't mention it?
[12:51] <soundray> evoldoer: I was just kidding
[12:51] <scottt106> soundray: see what?
[12:51] <soundray> evoldoer: I don't play that much
[12:51] <soundray> scottt106: ubotu's line ^^^
[12:51] <MENDIGO> amphi, hum, i cant eject the dvd =p
[12:52] <amphi> thoreauputic: probably; I imagine both are cheaply available on the 'black market' ;)
[12:52] <thoreauputic> amphi: heheh
[12:52] <soundray> evoldoer: but this German quiz bot has got me going yesterday and today...
[12:52] <scottt106> oh, wonderful, guess I came at the right time
[12:52] <amphi> MENDIGO: type 'eject' perhaps - or is it mounted?
[12:52] <scottt106> thanks  :)
[12:52] <MENDIGO> amphi, eject: unable to eject, last error: Invalid argument
[12:52] <amphi> MENDIGO: actually, eject should unmount it anyway
[12:52] <hawk1> are there any IRC masters in here?
[12:52] <evoldoer> i speak no german
[12:52] <amphi> MENDIGO: mplayer is running?
[12:52] <evoldoer> other than bier
[12:52] <Xbox_guru> amphi: lspci shows it as Cirrus Logic CS 4610/11
[12:53] <soundray> evoldoer: try same-gnome -- cures insomnia ;)
[12:53] <Xbox_guru> but its not in a slot
[12:53] <amphi> Xbox_guru: no matter - it's on the pci bus
[12:53] <evoldoer> robots does that for me
[12:53] <MENDIGO> amphi, no
[12:53] <hawk1> I'm tryin to get the Diablo bot to work.
[12:53] <dakira> music tip: rocket.fm
[12:53] <zack> what would i type after chown ? before the folder
[12:53] <Xbox_guru> amphi, I tried what I thought the modules for it were and come up with nothing
[12:53] <amphi> Xbox_guru: I'm on a laptop, and have loads of pci devices and nary a slot to be seen (apart from cardbus)
[12:53] <soundray> evoldoer: that's a very important word that will open many doors for you.
[12:53] <hawk1> and I'm struggling with the first task of verifieing that I have the perl stuff.
[12:54] <hawk1> brb
[12:54] <amphi> MENDIGO: you could use lsof to try to see what's using it
[12:54] <thoreauputic> zack: chown -R yourusername:yourusername  ( but you might need sudo as well)
[12:54] <amphi> MENDIGO: sudo eject do you any good?
[12:54] <Xbox_guru> amphi, btw, how do I install a tar.gz file
[12:55] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: depends on the file
[12:55] <Xbox_guru> i know I have to unpack it but I forget the command to unpack and install
[12:55] <amphi> Xbox_guru: you don't; you unpack it with tar zxvf foo.tar.gz
[12:55] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: tar xvzf <file.tar.gz>
[12:55] <amphi> Xbox_guru: and then you read README and INSTALL ;)
[12:55] <MENDIGO> amphi, lsof shows that mplayer is running
[12:55] <thoreauputic> amphi: bah you type faster
[12:55] <thoreauputic> ;)

[12:55] <Marsmensch> amphi, thanks have now installed gallery, now i will test it, nice screenshots on the website
[12:55] <chaos_of_apocaly> besides amule and bittorrent what else can i use?
[12:56] <amphi> Marsmensch: cool - never seen it myself ;)
[12:56] <eth0-noob> mutella
[12:56] <evoldoer> chaos: for bittorent or just P2P
[12:56] <chaos_of_apocaly> p2p
[12:56] <mysta> !frostwire
[12:56] <ubotu> frostwire is probably a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
[12:56] <Marsmensch> amphi: but your using? what to do after install? i need do some config?
[12:57] <eth0-noob> frostwire is java :X
[12:57] <soundray> test
[12:57] <MENDIGO> amphi, =/ now sound is going before video
[12:57] <evoldoer> i would just stick to bittorrent, most of the other p2ps I've seen are full of crap
[12:57] <amphi> Xbox_guru: ISTR something about lspci mistakenly identifying such cards perhaps
[12:57] <mysta> whats wrong w/ java?
[12:57] <amphi> MENDIGO: you can use + and - to adjust av sync
[12:57] <x-Dieu> hi soundray :)
[12:57] <hawk1> Can anybody help me get diablo4.0 to work on X_chat
[12:57] <eth0-noob> yea, torrent owns
[12:57] <soundray> x-Dieu: hi ;)
[12:57] <amphi> MENDIGO: or you could see if mplayer autosync=30 helps
[12:57] <chaos_of_apocaly> i wanted a song of crazy town-hurt you so bad but i cant find it anywhere.in amule its there but not enough sources
[12:58] <amphi> MENDIGO: er, mplayer -autosync 30 I mean
[12:58] <mattl> anyone running Dapper on a PowerBook G4 here?

[12:58] <amphi> MENDIGO: if that does it, 'echo autosync=30 >> ~/.mplayer/config' to 'make it so'
[12:58] <evoldoer> sorry chaos, not my cup of tea
[12:58] <hawk1> how do I verify if I have the perl script stuff the diablo requires?
[12:58] <soundray> evoldoer: what?
[12:59] <chaos_of_apocaly> can you tell me good torrent sites?
[12:59] <amphi> MENDIGO: man mplayer is there for your delectation, but it's not for the faint-hearted ;)
[12:59] <soundray> evoldoer: all right

[12:59] <soundray> evoldoer: I read "chaps" not "chaos" :)
[12:59] <Madpilot> chaos_of_apocaly, piracy is offtopic here - thanks.
[12:59] <katie_> libdvdcss2 or libdvdplay0 to playback dvds?
[01:00] <Madpilot> chaos_of_apocaly, but if you want legal music torrents, have a look at bt.etree.org
[01:00] <amphi> katie_: libdvdcss2 certainlu
[01:00] <amphi> *certainly
[01:00] <chaos_of_apocaly> legal=pay=not for me

[01:00] <chaos_of_apocaly> you say piracy i say freedom
[01:00] <Xbox_guru> amphi, I found a shell file, should I run the .sh file from the terminal?
[01:00] <katie_> amphi: thanks
[01:01] <amphi> katie_: ask the bot about dvd for more info
[01:01] <amphi> Xbox_guru: I have no idea what you're trying to do

[01:01] <ubotu> hawk1: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[01:01] <amphi> Xbox_guru: there should be some docs in there
[01:01] <Xbox_guru> amphi, Install a tar.gz file

[01:02] <redguy> Xbox_guru: awhat are you trying to install?
[01:02] <hawk1> How do I find out what perl mods I have installed?
[01:02] <Xbox_guru> the readme doesn't tell me how to install it
[01:03] <soundray> hawk1, they are called libperl-something
[01:03] <Xbox_guru> redguy: and Xbox media server so I can stream stuff over my network to my xbox
[01:03] <redguy> Xbox_guru: did you look for a ubuntu or debian .deb file already?
[01:03] <soundray> hawk1, sorry mistake
[01:03] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: I think you need to drop the part of your nick after the underscore ;)
[01:03] <amphi> thoreauputic: ooh
[01:03] <hawk1> no prob.
[01:03] <redguy> Xbox_guru: these are binary packages which are much less hassle to install
[01:04] <soundray> hawk1, they are called libsomething-perl
[01:04] <redguy> Xbox_guru: the .tar.gz you downloaded is most likely a source package which has to be compiled prior to installing
[01:04] <Xbox_guru> thoreauputic, no I just need to get better at linux
[01:04] <eugman> Is there a way to open a gtk window without running most of gnome?
[01:04] <soundray> hawk1, try 'apt-cache search perl library'
[01:04] <hawk1> good one, I'm on it soundray
[01:05] <soundray> hawk1, lots of output, but you can narrow it down.
[01:05] <Xbox_guru> redguy, there is a file in there called "makefile"
[01:05] <thoreauputic> amphi: My fave BOFH answer is to a guy who couldn't configure his mail client "You need to up your IQ afew points - try listening to classical music" ;-)
[01:05] <amphi> eugman: sure, if the prog doesn't link to gnome libs
[01:05] <amphi> thoreauputic: heheh
[01:05] <aqui1a> where do i install firestarter from? :)
[01:05] <Madpilot> aqui1a, it's in the repos

[01:06] <thoreauputic> !info firestarter
[01:06] <amphi> eugman: ldd /path/to/program will show you shared lib dependencies
[01:06] <thoreauputic> heh
[01:06] <redguy> Xbox_guru: fine, but that doesn't answer my question about the .deb files
[01:06] <soundray> ubotu, offon is Have you tried turning it off and on again?
[01:06] <ubotu> soundray: okay
[01:06] <Xbox_guru> redguy: I looked and couldn't find any
[01:06] <Xbox_guru> reguy, if I did, they would already be installed
[01:06] <amphi> eugman: I still don't understand why /bin/date links to libpthread...
[01:06] <soundray> ubotu: forget offon
[01:06] <ubotu> i forgot offon, soundray
[01:07] <redguy> Xbox_guru: well then you have to compile the package
[01:07] <redguy> !tell Xbox_guru about compiling
[01:07] <Xbox_guru> how do I run the makefile
[01:07] <aqui1a> if by repos, you mean 'Adept', i cant see it :(
[01:07] <redguy> Xbox_guru: read the wiki link ubotu sent you
[01:07] <thoreauputic> !tell aqui1a about repos
[01:08] <eugman> It doesn't look like it . Is there a way to run a program requiring x wituout starting up my gui? I want to run it with very high performance. It's a game.
[01:08] <Madpilot> aqui1a, it's in Universe - you might need to enable the Universe/Multiverse repo
[01:08] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell aqui1a about universe
[01:08] <Mysta_> if I want to shutdown and restart my machine, is "sudo shutdown -r now" the right command?
[01:08] <thoreauputic> Mysta_: yes
[01:08] <aqui1a> do you have that for kubuntu?
[01:09] <thoreauputic> Mysta_: just sudo reboot will do it too
[01:09] <UKMatt> how do I remove something that isn't in synaptec?
[01:09] <redguy> Xbox_guru: when it comes to installing, use checkinstall as suggested. It will ease the removal of the package when you decide that you don't want it anymore
[01:09] <Madpilot> aqui1a, see the URL the bot gave you - Kubuntu info is at the bottom of that page, I think
[01:09] <redguy> UKMatt: like in "something you compiled by yourself" ?
[01:09] <aqui1a> ah, i see, thanks :$
[01:09] <UKMatt> redguy, yeah...
[01:09] <hurax> eugman: you can start it from a remote machine with a x server
[01:09] <Mysta_> thereauputic: hmm, should I be able to login to my X session via VNC afterwards? right now I have to login locally and then i can VNC to the box?
[01:10] <eugman> Hmmm, I might try that sometime.
[01:10] <amphi> eugman: a program requiring X, er, requires X - you could use a light wm instead of gnome
[01:10] <UKMatt> redguy, someone had me run something, i forget the format but it was just like an .exe, it installed a game and i'm not sure how to take it off
[01:10] <odyssey> hello
[01:11] <cubikdice> hello Ubuntu community, could anyone spend a little time and point me in the right direction for installing the new 686 kernel?
[01:11] <hurax> well it just requires the x libraries, on our compute servers and clusters we don't have x servers running
[01:11] <thoreauputic> Mysta_: not sure - tightVNC keeps your session alive but I don't know about it with a reboot

[01:16] <amphi> blank_: I've used reiser3 a lot, and never had a problem but once, and rebuildtree fixed it, but many people have horror stories

[01:16] <blank_> or reiserfs

[01:17] <amphi> blank_: an option of reiserfsck - don't interrupt it ;)
[01:17] <dooglus> !info normalize-audio
[01:17] <ubotu> normalize-audio: (adjust the volume of WAV files to a standard volume level), section universe/sound, is extra. Version: 0.7.6-7 (breezy), Packaged size: 50 kB, Installed size: 196 kB
[01:17] <cin> Any way to... download and go to factory defaults with default Breezy without a CD?
[01:17] <dooglus> normalize-audio: usr/bin/normalize-mp3
[01:17] <blank_> amphi, haha okay
[01:17] <cubikdice> brb
[01:18] <amphi> blank_: man reiserfsck has the [really]  gory details
[01:18] <blank_> amphi, thanks, that might help sometime
[01:18] <mish4> guys... fonts.... help
[01:18] <azurehuesofblue> well, I can just keep collecting until I have dapper hehehe.
[01:18] <blank_> i can chroot into the hd and clal that command if i ever have problems right amphi ?
[01:18] <amphi> blank_: ask in #linuxhelp, many there seem to have been bitten badly by reiser
[01:18] <redguy> mish4: we are waiting for your real question
[01:18] <thoreauputic> dooglus: interesting - ubotu couldn't find it
[01:19] <blank_> amphi, yeah recently it got me hard haha
[01:19] <thoreauputic> dooglus: dpkg -S worked here ...
[01:19] <amphi> blank_: heh
[01:19] <blank_> amphi, so you think ext3 is more reliable atm?
[01:19] <mish4> the real question is, i downloaded fonts using apt-get , it downloaded a bunch of them. i want to make my firefox text not ugly, more readable. how do i do that
[01:19] <dooglus> thoreauputic: I used apt-file search
[01:19] <amphi> blank_: that seems to be the consensus, tried and tested
[01:19] <thoreauputic> dooglus: fair enough
[01:19] <amphi> blank_: I use xfs here at the moment
[01:19] <blank_> amphi, ah okay, xfs? new or something?
[01:20] <amphi> blank_: no, old sgi filesystem
[01:20] <redguy> amphi: xfs has it's horror stories as well... :-)
[01:20] <phenom> Can someone help me get GLProQuake running in Ubuntu please?
[01:20] <blank_> amphi, haha oh okay, well, see ya around man
[01:20] <azurehuesofblue> I wish with dapper I could configure my dual head display... it's like month 4... my sacrifice to run ubuntu :^(
[01:20] <phenom> !Quake
[01:20] <ubotu> I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, phenom
[01:20] <amphi> redguy: yeah, but them's fixed now, it seems
[01:20] <blank_> azurehuesofblue, #ubuntu+1
[01:20] <eugman> mish4, did you get the microsoft core fonts?
[01:21] <hurax> well must of the reiser horror stories are from the time when it was not considered stable enough to go into the official kernel, but suse used a patched kernel and made reiserfs default for their installation
[01:21] <hurax> most
[01:21] <mish4> yeah apt-get install msttcorefonts
[01:21] <azurehuesofblue> well I want the straight up official version, it's not out yet, right?... june 1st?
[01:21] <eugman> And things are still ugly?
[01:21] <mish4> in firefox yea
[01:21] <thoreauputic> azurehuesofblue: still in beta until June, yes
[01:22] <azurehuesofblue> k thx thoreauputic cya
[01:22] <thoreauputic> azurehuesofblue: it seems pretty stable already though
[01:22] <amphi> hurax: have you tried rieser4 ?
[01:22] <amphi> *reiser4
[01:22] <eugman> Then I suggest Preferences =>Fonts and
[01:22] <eugman> Colors
[01:22] <hurax> amphi: no
[01:22] <Aqua> Hey. Would somone be able to help me install Java on my ubuntu linux os? I just got it yesterday
[01:22] <eugman> Mess around a bit to find something not ugly.
[01:22] <thoreauputic> !java
[01:22] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[01:22] <amphi> !javadebs
[01:22] <ubotu> In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-j2re-1.5.0 is in multiverse
[01:22] <eugman> There may be a better way but I don't know it.
[01:23] <eugman> A reboot may also help if you just installed them but I'm only guessing.
[01:23] <spikeb> there's no IBM debs for PPC in multiverse :(
[01:23] <thoreauputic> Aqua: you'll need to add repositories
[01:23] <T`> anyone here using vmware on ubuntu amd64?
[01:23] <cin> I just did sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to dapper, and, well, it totally failed and now I don't even have vi, which is concerning.
[01:23] <Aqua> I can't install it. Like if I just double click jre_0_5 or whatever it is, it doesn't do anything
[01:23] <thoreauputic> ubotu tell Aqua about repos
[01:24] <Aqua> I've never touched linux in my life
[01:24] <thoreauputic> Aqua: wrong approach
[01:24] <Pyru> Aqua,  i love u
[01:24] <Aqua> What do you mean thoreau?
[01:24] <Aqua> I love you too pyru
[01:24] <cin> I'm watching Das Boot.
[01:24] <thoreauputic> Aqua: I suggest reading http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDocumentation
[01:24] <thoreauputic> Aqua: lots of good info there
[01:25] <cin> !dapperinstall
[01:25] <ubotu> cin: My cat's name is Mittens! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[01:25] <cin> !dapper
[01:25] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[01:25] <spikeb> !upgrade
[01:25] <ubotu> I guess upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[01:25] <Primal> if i gave you guys the type of motherboard or whatever, would you be able to tell me if a video card is compatible?
[01:25] <Xbox_guru> is Win4lin in the repositories
[01:25] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: proprietary
[01:25] <cin> Hm, thanks spikeb. I'll get on with lynx.
[01:25] <Primal> i'm trying to find a video card that will let me run atitvout
[01:25] <eugman> More specifically, aqua, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Repositories and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
[01:26] <Xbox_guru> thoreauptic?
[01:26] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: win 4 lin is not Free software
[01:26] <thoreauputic> Xbox_guru: you can buy it I believe, but it isn't open
[01:26] <btrento> has anyone got geda working?
[01:27] <Archville> Hi, i've installed sshd server on Ubuntu.
[01:27] <Xbox_guru> is there any programs that will run windows programs
[01:27] <Old> !pastebin

[01:27] <Archville> Is there any way to restrict users to their home directory ?
[01:27] <kuitang> uh, ya, wine...
[01:27] <Aqua> See I just need to install java so I can play runescape

[01:29] <ubotu> XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/
[01:29] <Aqua> hehe linux is harder than I thought it would be
[01:29] <katie_> francais #ubuntu-fr
[01:29] <skircr115> no, yo no ayudo tu
[01:29] <NanoBCN> sip, just type "/join #ubuntu-es"
[01:29] <sip> jajajaok, & tkks ...
[01:30] <eugman> Aqua, It's hard at first but you can do alot after the first hill.
[01:30] <NanoBCN> de nada
[01:30] <kuitang> don't worry, once you start using screen as your window manager and setting up lans and routers it cant get much harder
[01:30] <spikeb> Aqua: it's not really hard, just different.
[01:30] <cubikdice> hello again, should i do the nvidia-glx enabler thing before or after i install nvidia-glx
[01:30] <sip> u are very fun... who`re u?
[01:30] <Primal> i want to run atitvout, but my current video card (radeon 7200) isn't supported, so i'm thinking of buying a cheap radeon 9250
[01:30] <Primal> i need to know if my computer can use it
[01:31] <disinterseted_pe> ok, how do i go about getting the volume on my keyboard to work
[01:31] <cubikdice> Primal, nVidia r0xerz ;)
[01:31] <felipe__> How do I refresh the gnome menu?
[01:31] <Primal> okay, i'm open to nvidea too
[01:31] <katie_> how should i troubleshoot if serpentine says there is no recording device and i have a cd burner?
[01:31] <Primal> doesn't matter really. i just want a card with tv-video out
[01:31] <eugman> Katie, Does the computer see the drive? Can it read cd's?
[01:32] <cubikdice> Primal, then look into an nvidia card..the new ones have HD tv out as well
[01:32] <Primal> but i need to know specifically if the card will work in my old computer and will be supported by some linux program
[01:32] <katie_> eugman:  what do i type?
[01:32] <Primal> the card has to be agp
[01:32] <katie_> eugman:  i see it in the computer window
[01:32] <tubbie> how do I install a smp kernel?
[01:32] <skircr115> hola! como estas amigo?
[01:33] <cubikdice> Primal, google the nvidia 7900 GS
[01:33] <Primal> thanks, cubikdice
[01:33] <tubbie> can I use a smp kernel with the nvidia module?
[01:33] <Xbox_guru> how do I edit the repositories to take out .us
[01:33] <cubikdice> thoreauputic, hey again, should i do the nvidia-glx enable thing before or after install nvidia-glx
[01:33] <cubikdice> Primal, np
[01:33] <kbrooks> tubbie: all kernels can be used with the nvidia module
[01:33] <NanoBC1> cubikdice: after
[01:33] <cubikdice> Xbox_guru, edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:33] <eugman> Katie, I would look for some other burning programs like gnomebaker, and install them to see if the problem is with serpentine. After that I don't know.
[01:34] <tubbie> what kernel should I use for my p4 with HT?
[01:34] <cubikdice> NanoBC1, oops i guess i should say before or after restarting
[01:34] <thoreauputic> cubikdice: I don't know much about nvidia - did you follow the wiki ?
[01:34] <cubikdice> thoreauputic, nvm sorry
[01:34] <skircr115> cows are cool and sexy
[01:34] <cubikdice> mooo
[01:34] <NanoBC1> cubikdice: it doesn't really matter since you don't have to restart after installing it
[01:35] <Primal> cubikdice, wow that card is expensive
[01:35] <cubikdice> NanoBC1, oh yeah! this is linux!
[01:35] <cubikdice> :P
[01:35] <cubikdice> Primal, oh yeah...well...heh
[01:35] <NanoBC1> cubikdice: indeed, ;)
[01:35] <Primal> radeon 9250 is only 30-40 bucks
[01:35] <cubikdice> NanoBC1, look into an nvidia TNT2
[01:35] <cubikdice> thats in your range
[01:35] <Primal> the computer the card is going into is a really old p3
[01:35] <cubikdice> oops
[01:35] <thoreauputic> hi apokryphos :)
[01:35] <Primal> 922mhz
[01:36] <cubikdice> Primal, look into a nVidia Riva TNT2
[01:36] <Primal> i mean 933
[01:36] <cubikdice> thats in your range
[01:36] <apokryphos> hola thoreauputic; how's ti going? :)
[01:36] <Primal> just got rid of one that died
[01:36] <Primal> no tv-video out
[01:36] <thoreauputic> apokryphos: much faster with adsl2+ ;-)
[01:36] <cubikdice> a nVidia Rive TNT2?
[01:36] <apokryphos> thoreauputic: w00t :D
[01:36] <Primal> yes
[01:36] <apokryphos> thoreauputic: just in time for dapper, too, eh :P
[01:36] <thoreauputic> apokryphos: indeed :D
[01:36] <skircr115> TNT its dynamite
[01:36] <cubikdice> hmm i have one with TV out
[01:36] <cubikdice> lol
[01:36] <apokryphos> good stuff
[01:36] <thoreauputic> apokryphos: already upgraded :)
[01:37] <thoreauputic> apokryphos: now I have to curb the download frenzy ;-)
[01:37] <Primal> seriously? i may look harder for that
[01:37] <cubikdice> Primal, oh oops thats Video out nvm
[01:37] <interferon> Can anyone recommend a good POP server that integrates easily with Postfix?
[01:37] <tubbie> what kernel should I use for my p4 with HT?
[01:38] <phaed2> Do we ever start to hear a buzz a few days before the next version is officially released, or is it usually a secret right up to the day of release?
[01:38] <apokryphos> tubbie: 686
[01:38] <spikeb> SMP i would think, tubbie
[01:38] <spikeb> apokryphos: why not SMP?
[01:38] <tubbie> but I don't see any 2.6.x smp kernel in apt-get
[01:38] <tubbie> :\
[01:39] <apokryphos> is HT something else?
[01:39] <spikeb> apokryphos: HT = hyperthreading. it fakes the appearance of multiple procs
[01:39] <apokryphos> not well versed with pentiums
[01:39] <apokryphos> ok; yup, smp
[01:39] <apokryphos> 686-smp then
[01:39] <tubbie> how do I install the kernel?
[01:39] <apokryphos> !info linux-686-smp
[01:39] <open_shell> Hi. If I wanted to start an application in Ubuntu as the SU how would I create an icon on the desktop and make it open and ask for the password? I know I could open a terminal and do it but I would like to skip the extra step.
[01:40] <ubotu> linux-686-smp: (Complete Linux kernel on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV SMP.), section restricted/base, is optional. Version: 2.6.12.16 (breezy), Packaged size: 22 kB, Installed size: 48 kB
[01:40] <NanoBC1> tubbie: just like any other package
[01:40] <cubikdice> tubbie, sudo apt-get install linux-686
[01:40] <NanoBC1> tubbie: use synaptic and that's it
[01:40] <tubbie> downloading :)
[01:40] <interferon> open_shell, use "gksu command"
[01:41] <tubbie> hope it will work better
[01:41] <felipe__> tubbie, search for it in Sinaptyc
[01:41] <cubikdice> tubbie, i hope too :_
[01:42] <Aqua> I'm downloading the java, now it says.. Make the downloaded file Execuatable. What's that mean?
[01:42] <tubbie> brb, reboot
[01:42] <open_shell> interferon: It opened up no problem but did not ask for a SU password
[01:43] <spikeb> no no no that's not right
[01:43] <interferon> open_shell, it should
[01:43] <NanoBC1> remember there's you won't be asked for password again if you recently wrote it down
[01:43] <open_shell> Hmm let me check on it interferon
[01:44] <NanoBC1> I think there's like 5 minutes of "memory"
[01:44] <interferon> open_shell, use "gksu whatevertheprogramis" as the Command field for the launcher
[01:44] <open_shell> That is what I have interferon. I have gksu quanta %U
[01:45] <open_shell> Interferon: It lets me save now to the var/www/ folder so it worked without asking for the password.
[01:46] <open_shell> Thanks Interferon.
[01:46] <interferon> open_shell, ah.  quote the whole command, e.g. 'gksu "quanta %u"'
[01:47] <open_shell> ok will try that now.
[01:47] <open_shell> Can anyone tell me if there is a similar shortcut to minimize all windows via the keyboard
[01:48] <interferon> open_shell, you can set a shortcut to show the desktop, which is similar
[01:48] <Drake_> is there a simple way to generate the md5 for a single word?
[01:48] <hurax> echo singleword | md5sum
[01:48] <open_shell> Interferon is there  a website you recommend?
[01:49] <interferon> open_shell, for what?
[01:49] <Primal> ubuntu.com - good website
[01:49] <open_shell> For learning the GNOME shortcuts?
[01:50] <open_shell> Oh duh there is a app for it
[01:50] <open_shell> Sorry I just found it.
[01:50] <interferon> open_shell, try the Keyboard Shortcuts option in System | Preferences
[01:50] <Drake_> hurax: thanks a lot I knew it couldn't be that difficult I was banging my head against the wall lol
[01:52] <sip> hi
[01:52] <sip> hola
[01:52] <sip> konichiwa
[01:52] <acke_> hey i just installed ubuntu. however i never got as far as entering the gnome environment. I am stuck with the bash. I tried to run startx but then i get fatal error 104 connection reset by peer on x server 0:0. I cant do sudo halt or sudo shutdown, (unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname() ) In my /var/log/Xorg.0.log the last row states "Fatal server error: no screens found" What can i do?? o.O
[01:52] <sip> dobry den
[01:52] <sip> bon noite
[01:52] <Flannel> acke_: you probably don't have X (or gnome, etc) installed.
[01:53] <open_shell> If I wanted to use a p2p app what one is the most useful to a minimalist user who just wants to watch some anime?
[01:53] <Aqua> spikeb,  did you get my pm

[01:54] <Flannel> acke_: did you do a server install? or, what error happened? as there might be more problems than just no X installed.

[01:58] <amphi> caravena: did you get a message from dpkg? that might be the solution
[01:58] <feelxXx> Aqua: what's the problem?
[01:59] <acke_> Flannel, so i got the same issue with ubuntu refusing to start up x when i use the live CD.
[01:59] <amphi> MENDIGO: in general, if mplayer has an option '-foo bar', you can put a line 'foo=bar' in ~/.mplayer/config to make it use that by default
[01:59] <acke_> SO it doesnt help reinstalling. I didnt do anything "wrong" when installing ubuntu
[02:00] <caravena> amphi: message of dpkg " "violation of segment" in packages...
[02:00] <amphi> caravena: that's all?
[02:00] <caravena> amphi: crash dpkg-reconfigure -all
[02:00] <feelxXx> Aqua: btw, an "simple file" you'll never be able to "install" - so, it's probably not you fault
[02:00] <acke_> How do I uninstall the grub loader?
[02:00] <MENDIGO> amphi, got it!! i will note that
[02:01] <feelxXx> acke_: what else you want to use?
[02:01] <Aqua> Sorry about the language Feel. I'm just trying to get Java onto my comp so I can play Runescape
[02:02] <amphi> MENDIGO: obviously you can edit the file, just 'echo foo=bar >> ~/.mplayer/config' is quicker for adding one-liners
[02:02] <Aqua> XP failed, and i've never used linux before
[02:02] <derdewey> how do I get the dapper beta 7 to boot into the live cd?  I've only been able to do the graphical installer...
[02:02] <Madpilot> Aqua, have you seen the Java page on the ubuntu wiki?
[02:02] <darius_> Aqua: it's been a while since I've played that game .. but it does indeed play under Linux
[02:02] <Aqua> Yeah, somone sent it before.. but I follow the instructions, and theres so many times.
[02:02] <amphi> MENDIGO: note the '>>' to append to the file, rather than '>' to overwrite it
[02:02] <Aqua> And when I play it, it says install this plugin, and when I try it, it just fails
[02:02] <Aqua> like it just keeps failing to install
[02:03] <Aqua> and I even follow there commands through the terminal, whcih also fail
[02:03] <caravena> dpkg-reconfigure all || [...]  || * Stopping apache 2.0 web server || /var/lib/dpkg/info/apache2-mpm-prefork.prerm: line 6: 9151 Violation of segment.
[02:03] <RemyHome> derdewey, do you have the live CD or the install CD ?
[02:03] <Madpilot> Aqua, right after the Sun Java section of the wiki, there's a smaller section on making sure your system is using the correct version of Java - have you followed that?
[02:03] <amphi> caravena: is this dapper or breezy?
[02:03] <ahmeni> Can one go from debian stable to ubuntu just by changing the apt sources list?
[02:03] <derdewey> RemyHome, hmm, it was the first download on the ubuntu page
[02:03] <caravena> amphi: (Many thanks you), dapper
[02:04] <amphi> caravena: try asking in #ubuntu+1, that's the dapper channel
[02:04] <RemyHome> derdewey, not sure mate, sorry
[02:04] <caravena> amphi: (Sorry my english.  Yes is very bad : -(
[02:04] <amphi> caravena: what is your default language?
[02:04] <derdewey> oh darn, looks like install
[02:05] <derdewey> will the live cd allow me to do the installation as well?
[02:05] <caravena> amphi: Spanish
[02:05] <amphi> caravena: there's also #ubuntu-es
[02:05] <Madpilot> derdewey, the Dapper liveCD will - the Breezy one can't
[02:05] <caravena> amphi: My language is Spanish
[02:05] <jksd> anyone know where I can download the mp4 plugin for gnomebaker?
[02:05] <caravena> amphi: Not help : -(.
[02:05] <jksd> if there is one
[02:05] <amphi> caravena: heh - try #ubuntu+1
[02:05] <Aqua> Yearggggg
[02:06] <Aqua> jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin is on the desktop, what would be the command to put in the terminal to install it
[02:06] <vars> hey is there a web site that will tell me how to turn a computer into a web server so i can serve a web page
[02:06] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell vars about apache
[02:07] <Drake_> what log would show what crapped out on the network side of linux box to prevent anymore connections but the box is still physically running and can log into it locally?
[02:07] <acuster> hey all
[02:07] <amphi> vars: there are lighter webservers too - tldp.org may well have a howto
[02:07] <Madpilot> Aqua, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats has all the info you'll need...
[02:07] <acuster> anyone else unable to have the confirm dialog on exit?
[02:07] <acuster> there's no way for me to save only the session states that I want to save
[02:08] <acuster> and therefore no way to save a default session setup
[02:08] <Madpilot> Aqua, I think you need the JRE package, not the JDK - jdk is the development/programmers kit
[02:08] <malachi> hello
[02:08] <feelxXx> Aqua: ./jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin if it's already executeable
[02:08] <Madpilot> acuster, are you running Dapper or breezy
[02:08] <Madpilot> ?
[02:08] <malachi> hello
[02:08] <tubbie> compiz.real: Couldn't load plugin 'libtransset.so'
[02:08] <acuster> dapper
[02:08] <tubbie> any idea?
[02:08] <Madpilot> Aqua, exact URL: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats#head-fabecb1554d75cd3116507e4da83335d4e4f8f3e
[02:09] <malachi> why doesn't some SiS cards have opengl support?
[02:09] <Madpilot> acuster, Dapper has the f'd up looking giant logout screen, right? With no 'save session' checkbox...
[02:09] <dust> hey! does anyone know where to set display hotkeys?
[02:09] <acuster> yeah
[02:09] <acuster> the dialog that's always beneath all the other windows
[02:09] <harrisonk> how can i change what resolution options I have for X?
[02:10] <acuster> must be metacity "remembering" it was open before
[02:10] <Aqua> okay, now I have jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin
[02:10] <Madpilot> acuster, fun. File a bug on it at https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bugs
[02:10] <dust> do hotkeys exits in ubuntu?
[02:10] <acuster> Madpilot: for the session management or the logout dialog or both?
[02:11] <acuster> Madpilot: I can't imagine the developers don't know about that
[02:11] <Madpilot> acuster, either or both - but search lp for bugs before you file a new one
[02:11] <acuster> it's much more likely to be cruft in my home directory
[02:11] <harrisonk> how can i change what resolution options I have for X?
[02:11] <open_shell> If you want to listen to radio station or watch Internet TV what app is the one to use
[02:11] <sip> hola cual es el canal en espaol, por favor?
[02:11] <ubuntuneil> harrisonk,-> sudo dpkg-reconfigure x-server-xorg
[02:12] <Madpilot> Aqua, see the long URL I posted above, it'll walk you thru installing Java thru the Terminal
[02:12] <Madpilot> !es
[02:12] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[02:12] <sip> gracias amigo
[02:12] <harrisonk> ubuntuneil, thats exactly the command i was lookin for, thanks
[02:13] <Madpilot> Aqua, after you do the install, be sure and scroll down to the "Selecting the default Java version" section below it and do that too
[02:13] <alexcamilo{ubunt> apt get told me to look at the syslog. where is the syslog?
[02:13] <Aqua> Yes I did, But I keep getting stuck, it keeps telling me "No such file or directory"
[02:13] <Drake_> where is logging done that would give a clue why network connections aren't able to connect anymore but can still log into the box locallly?
[02:13] <Madpilot> Aqua, what does?
[02:13] <ubuntuneil> !dapper
[02:13] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[02:13] <Aqua> ./chmod +x jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586.bin
[02:13] <bodog> hey everybody
[02:14] <bodog> i got a question
[02:14] <bodog> i'm using ubuntu... and i was wondering what the best torrent program was
[02:14] <bodog> and how to get it
[02:14] <Madpilot> Aqua, where did you save the bin file?
=== Guest25394 is now known as leonardootto
[02:14] <Aqua> desktop
[02:14] <eatingtheproverb> hello i need help finding a way to conect to yahoo chat with ubuntu
[02:14] <Madpilot> Aqua, OK. Start with "cd Desktop", then the chmod command
[02:14] <dust> bodog: i like azureus.
[02:14] <harrisonk> uh oh
[02:14] <Drake_> eatingtheproverb: gaim
[02:14] <harrisonk> Package `x-server-xorg' is not installed and no info is available.
[02:14] <Aqua> so... "cd desktop" chmod +x blah blah blah?
[02:14] <eatingtheproverb> ok were do i get it
[02:14] <dust> i don't know if it is the best but i like it.
[02:15] <ash_> someone willing to help with xgl ( ubuntu-xgl is dead..)
[02:15] <Madpilot> eatingtheproverb, it should already be installed - Applications -> Internet -> Gaim
[02:15] <bodog> dust: is there a way to unblock ports in azureus?
[02:15] <ash_> I followed the XglHowto and gset-compiz did want to install so I added the sources from the xglati howto for compiz and xgl and it all installed nice
[02:15] <ash_> <ash_> I entered to my gnome and the 3d works and the cube is ok
[02:15] <ash_> <ash_> but the window border deisapeer and all the windows look fuzzyy in way I cant see nothing in the menus
[02:15] <ash_> <ash_> I am using nvidia-glx drivers and it works nice the 3d works but I dont know why I have this other problem
[02:15] <l_r> how is the future ubuntu stable going?
[02:16] <Arrick> its not l_r
[02:16] <bodog> dust: coz i dont know how to use different ports on bittorrent... and the torrent i'm using blacklists port 6882
[02:16] <l_r> ok, do you need some help?
[02:16] <dust> you can pick specific ports but i don't know exactly what you mean by unblock
[02:16] <bodog> well, "unblock": isn't the right term to use i guess
[02:16] <bimberi> l_r: on schedule for June 1 release afaik
[02:16] <Madpilot> l_r, the next stable release of Ubuntu is coming out on June 1st, if that's what you wanted to know
[02:17] <dust> to 'unblock' ports you would have to change settings in your firewall
[02:17] <bodog> yeah.. unblock is the wrong word
[02:17] <bodog> i meant... use a different port other than 6882
[02:17] <Aqua> Okay, so I did the desktop part.. and then I did the chmod, and it just goes down to the next line like it didn't do anything
[02:17] <Madpilot> Aqua, that's fine. Keep going w/ the next command now.
[02:17] <ubuntuneil> harrisonk,-> try this sorry for the typo erro -->sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:18] <kelvie> what's the package that has the devel tools like make and libtool, and gcc and all that jazz?
[02:18] <kelvie> binutils and glibc, etc
[02:18] <Aqua> sudo aptitude install fakeroot java-package java-common then?
[02:18] <Madpilot> Aqua, in the command line, Linux tends to fail noisily, but succeed silently
[02:18] <dust> i believe that bittorrent uses a whole range of ports from 4000-8000 or something at (near) random
[02:18] <Madpilot> Aqua, yes
[02:18] <bodog> coz the one crazy port is blacklisted for some odd reason
[02:18] <Madpilot> kelvie, build-essential
[02:18] <dust> but azureus you can pick your port in the options
[02:18] <kelvie> Madpilot: thank you, sir
[02:18] <bodog> thx brotha
[02:19] <acuster> Madpilot: thanks
[02:19] <dust> bodog: no problem
[02:19] <Aqua> couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "java-package
[02:19] <Aqua> then it installed a fakeroot
[02:20] <dust> okay so back to hotkeys-- does anyone know where to set display hotkeys?
[02:20] <Madpilot> Aqua, you probably need to enable Universe/Multiverse repos
[02:20] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell Aqua about multiverse
[02:20] <Drake_> what would be the best log files to look into to see what caused remote connections to stop working though the box is still running and can log into it locally?
[02:21] <MrTaint> hello?
[02:21] <bimberi> hi MrTaint
[02:21] <MrTaint> wats up
[02:21] <MrTaint> how do i register my name once and for all?
[02:22] <bimberi> !tell MrTaint about register
[02:22] <Madpilot> MrTaint, you can also put your freenode password in your IRC app's settings, so it give the pw automatically on login
[02:23] <MrTaint> oh ok
[02:27] <miro_> hi
[02:28] <aqui1a> do i need to 'refresh' a panel for updates to be shown?
[02:28] <aqui1a> e.g in ubuntu, killall gnome-panel
[02:28] <aqui1a> << using kubuntu
[02:29] <apokryphos> you don't, no
[02:29] <apokryphos> aqui1a: #kubuntu is good for kde-related help :)
[02:29] <miro_> how do I get some codecs to totem?
[02:29] <Marsmensch> hmmm i tried gallery now, doesn't really impress me much. :-/
[02:29] <apokryphos> miro_: /msg ubotu restrictedformats
[02:30] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: yeah, it's not great. Use flickr 8)
[02:30] <linux_newbie2> I tried to install Ubuntu this weekend and it failed on the installing base system step, but the MD5 of the image I DLed checks out, any ideas?
[02:30] <Ophiocus> all of a sudden am getting choppy sound after latest update,.. any ideas on that?
[02:31] <usuarioribas> hola

[02:31] <Ophiocus> linux_newbie2: sometimes the burning media is crap,.. try to burn at lower speeds and diferent media brand
[02:31] <miro_> gracias
[02:31] <usuarioribas> hola miro_
[02:31] <Aqua> I quit :P
[02:32] <Aqua> I'm just gonna go back to windows ME
[02:32] <usuarioribas> hola aqua
[02:32] <Marsmensch> apokryphos: flickr? never heard about it? at the moment i use a shellscript, creating thumbnails and html code for me ... thought php would be nicer ... but it's also harder
[02:32] <linux_newbie2> Ophiocus: the weird thing is, I tried an edubuntu CD I had used successfully on a different machine and that one failed too O_O
[02:32] <usuarioribas> hola
[02:32] <usuarioribas> hello
[02:32] <Aqua> hiya
[02:32] <Aqua> i dont' have the patience for linux :(
[02:32] <Aqua> I'm going back to windows
[02:32] <Ophiocus> then you may be having hardware issues
[02:33] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: shellscript might be good practice for bash :P, but there are already some decent enough simplistic HTML converters out there (Konqueror has an option, Digikam too)
[02:33] <Aqua> Later guys, thanks for all the help
[02:33] <Marsmensch> apokryphos: you have some scrennshoots or something?
[02:33] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: http://flickr.com is flickr, by the way
[02:33] <Rhine> Can someone help me fix this problem when I am just doing work Linux seems to "crash" and it goes to the log in screen and i can login and stuff but its happening very often now 3 times in the last 10 mins
[02:33] <linux_newbie2> Ophiocus: that was my thought, although I have never had a problem with this DVD drive in the past
[02:33] <nathansnook> Does anyone know if the new Ubuntu is going to support Gnome 2.14
[02:34] <linux_newbie2> Ophiocus: would it get hung up if there were bad sectors in the area on the HD where I am attempting to install?  this is a laptop
[02:34] <nathansnook> I am new to ubuntu and it seemed that Fedora core was a bit fast in the gnome aspect
[02:34] <RemyHome> nathansnook, ask in #ubuntu+1
[02:34] <Marsmensch> apokryphos: yeah, you know the google prog to create websites? i have used shellscript to create so looking code ;)
[02:34] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: erm, I guess I could take one now
[02:34] <nathansnook> Thankz
[02:34] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: yeah, good for your grandma, bad for anyone who knwos about html/css :P
[02:35] <Marsmensch> why you think so?
[02:35] <apokryphos> not a huge array of options really, eh
[02:36] <linux_newbie2> Ophiocus: alternatively, I know Debian can be installed from a pair of floppies, does Ubuntu have that option?
[02:36] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: http://giannaros.org/hmlgallery.png
[02:36] <Ophiocus> yes
[02:36] <Flannel> nathansnook: yes.  http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperbeta
[02:36] <Ophiocus> i aint got the specific url,.. go to the main site and follow the how to get ubuntu trail
[02:36] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: dang, wrong image
[02:37] <Marsmensch> apokryphos: yes, i have seen ;)
[02:37] <Peter-Brazil> what channel of ubuntu in Brazil? Please
[02:37] <Flannel> linux_newbie2: no, ubunt doesn't have a floppy install
[02:37] <Flannel> !br
[02:37] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
[02:37] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: http://giannaros.org/htmlgallery.png
[02:37] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: of course the basics there are configurable. Digikam has a few more options though, you can have galleries like: http://www.omat.nl/drupal/?q=node/75
[02:37] <disinterseted_pe> ok streamlink was working on one site then i uninstalled the totem from the mplayer folder now it doesnt work
[02:38] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: not greatly beautiful, of course; but simplistic and very quickly generated.
[02:38] <disinterseted_pe> now both sites want me to download mp10
[02:38] <Drake_> where are logs that would indicate what are possible problems from logging in remotely?
[02:38] <acuster> defeated by the bug system :-(
[02:38] <Marsmensch> hmm, looks very nice ... a bit like my one ;) what do you think about it?
[02:38] <Flannel> Drake_: all logs are in /var/log you might try auth.log
[02:38] <Ophiocus> disinterseted_pe: sety a new default plyer for streams
[02:39] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: the html gallery?
[02:39] <disinterseted_pe> ok do u have working stream?
[02:40] <apokryphos> nice, of course, though these days I'd probably only use flickr. It's really great.
[02:40] <Drake_> Flannel: ok thanks wasn't sure if dmesg would show anything or if it would be somewhere else. I can connect and it works fine for days and then it fails when I try to log in several days later
[02:41] <Marsmensch> apokryphos: 2 more questions: can you say something about the size of the prog? and second, how to use it? is it like a prog or more like a webinterface?? yeah the html gallery ... contains also css ;-)
[02:41] <disinterseted_pe> im just asking to know which player ur useing
[02:41] <bigmarCus> state the problem please. Thank you
[02:41] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: the first one I showed you a screeny from is just an option in konqueror. Tools > Create Image Gallery
[02:42] <apokryphos> I doubt nautilus has anything similar
[02:42] <apokryphos> but hey
[02:42] <Marsmensch> yes?
[02:42] <bodog> Q: How do I find my IP Address???
[02:42] <dooglus> ifconfig will tell you your internal ip address
[02:42] <apokryphos> bodog: external? whatismyip.com
=== Omnipresent is now known as Pimpshizzled
[02:42] <Flannel> bodog: the most reliable and hardware free method is http://whatismyip.com
[02:43] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: Konqueror is KDE's File Manager and Web Browser
[02:43] <disinterseted_pe> how do i set a default media player
[02:43] <bodog> thank you
[02:43] <vars> what is a BOF    ?
[02:43] <bodog> what about my routed ip ??
[02:43] <apokryphos> birds of feather
[02:44] <Flannel> Burrito of Fun!
[02:44] <Flannel> bodog: you mean your LAN IP? or what?
=== dreamthief is now known as dreamthief|away
[02:44] <bodog> yeah lan ip
[02:44] <Flannel> bodog: use ifconfig
[02:45] <bodog> thanks!
[02:45] <Marsmensch> i know, apokryphos .... i will give it, a try; first of all i have to delete gallery
[02:46] <apokryphos> Marsmensch: digikam has an option too, though; it's available in the repositories
[02:46] <siriusnova> howdy
[02:46] <apokryphos> though not sure if it has the latest looks as the second link above
[02:46] <apokryphos> hi siriusnova
[02:46] <siriusnova> heh im using Suse 10.1 atm :X
[02:46] <apokryphos> me too 8)
[02:46] <siriusnova> Yast is sooo slow
[02:46] <siriusnova> im switching back to ubuntu
[02:46] <apokryphos> yup, yast sucks in 10.1. Smart is the shiznit though
[02:47] <siriusnova> what's smart?
[02:47] <cin> Hey, I'm currently logged in recovery mode. I tried upgrading to dapper and a lot of things went terribly wrong. Is there a way to get to the Ubuntu installation program without the CD?
[02:47] <apokryphos> siriusnova: /msg susehelp smart
[02:47] <cin> :\
[02:47] <siriusnova> hrmm okay
[02:47] <apokryphos> which, ironically, canonical is sponsoring the development of ;-)
[02:47] <siriusnova> hehe
[02:48] <apokryphos> there are a few thoughts of using it in edgy (dapper+1)
[02:48] <siriusnova> but really Yast is SLOW and takes forever to configure simple things, ugh, Suse needs to ditch rpm entirely
[02:48] <apokryphos> siriusnova: it's got nothing to do with RPM and all to do with the new zmd backend
[02:48] <Marsmensch> but it all needs a os, and a lot of user interaction ... hmmm ... let me see, i use dapper,
[02:48] <apokryphos> which just wasn't fully implemented properly
[02:48] <cin> >.>
[02:48] <apokryphos> also, I presume you mean "yast installer", not just yast.
[02:48] <daryl_> Is anyone here familiar with the Terminal Server Client, for using a remote desktop, and how to get sound working?
[02:48] <cin> Yeah, any suggestions would be appreciated.
[02:49] <cin> As much as commandline rocks for personal computing.
[02:49] <Flannel> cin: you have a real question?
[02:49] <Creteil> hi all
[02:49] <apokryphos> hi
[02:49] <siriusnova> apokryphos - yeah probably, and I mean yast in general. Configuring stuff takes ages and its just slow and clunky. I like Ubuntu's way of doing things. Not have one big convoluted slow app do everything but have small fast apps :X
[02:49] <cin> Flannel: I considered it to be "real", why?
[02:50] <apokryphos> siriusnova: curious, I've never noticed any slack in the rest of yast. Needless to say, if it was slow, I'd rather have it there than not at all ;-)
[02:50] <Creteil> how i can know from what package a file come from ??? (for example /etc/init.d/NetworkManager file)
[02:50] <cin> Flannel, you deemed my question "not real" so you can't help me? Fantastic.
[02:50] <apokryphos> siriusnova: though I love Ubuntu, there's no distro (including Ubuntu) that has anything as great as yast
[02:50] <apokryphos> it's quite amazing; and all free (as in liberty) now too =)
[02:50] <cin> I really would search Google instead of asking for abuse in here, but, it's not the easiest thing to search for.
[02:50] <interferon> what package contains saslauthd?
[02:50] <daryl_> I am using Terminal Server Client.  I am connecting to a Windows 2003 Server.  The server does not have a sound card built in.  My computer does have a sound card.  I am trying to run a Windows Application throught he Terminal Server Client, and hear the sounds on my computer.  How do i do this?
[02:51] <apokryphos> cin: what's the problem?
[02:51] <open_shell> can someone tell me where to get the non-us sources list please
[02:51] <siriusnova> brb rebooting into ubuntu
[02:51] <Flannel> daryl_: does Terminal SErver do sound forwarding?
[02:51] <daryl_> Flannel: it says it does
[02:51] <apokryphos> open_shell: just replace all "us." in /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:51] <Flannel> daryl_: fair enough ;)
[02:52] <open_shell> Replace wiht what?
[02:52] <cin> apokryphos: I attempted an upgrade with apt-get and rebooted to find that my startup crashes, and a lot of programs are missing. I don't know enough to fix this myself. So I was wondering if there is a way to get to the Ubuntu installation disk to "reset" all the settings or something.
[02:52] <Flannel> cin: no. I just didn't SEE a question at all.
[02:52] <cin> Flannel, oh, your mistake. :)
[02:52] <apokryphos> cin: are you on breezy?
[02:52] <daryl_> Flannel: under the "Local Resources" tab, I have 'On the local Computer' selected for sound.  but it doesn't play it.  I'm wondering if my server has to hvae a sound card... dunno what the problem is.
[02:52] <cin> apokryphos: yeah.
[02:52] <apokryphos> cin: what programs are missing?
[02:53] <cin> apokryphos, probably... I don't expect the dapper upgrade went too well.
[02:53] <cin> apokryphos: vi.
[02:53] <cin> apokryphos: essential things like that.
[02:53] <apokryphos> cin: so you are on dapper ;)
[02:53] <cin> apokryphos: Dapper doesn't have vi?/
[02:53] <apokryphos> no
[02:53] <apokryphos> vim
[02:53] <cin> Oh.
[02:53] <Flannel> it should have an alias of vi to vim though.
[02:53] <ziss> hi, can anyone tell me where the longhaul module gets loaded from on boot?
[02:54] <cin> Normal startup crashes nearly every program and I can only get on on safe mode at present. :|
[02:54] <apokryphos> cin: #ubuntu+1
[02:54] <cin> apokryphos, righto, thanks.
[02:54] <ziss> it doesnt appear in /etc/modules and i think its part of the hardware detection
[02:55] <jhenn_> how can i upgrade to dapper from breezy?
[02:55] <bimberi> !upgrade
[02:55] <ubotu> upgrade is, like, Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[02:55] <frantic> friends, i need some assistance
[02:55] <feetboy16> i accidentally formatted a hard drive. is there any linux tool for unformatting?
[02:56] <eddiestone> feetboy16, maybe you could find your data in the heaven
[02:56] <frantic> you know how there's two ways for linux to keep track of time?
[02:57] <frantic> one is unix time i think, and the other is harmonious with windows
[02:57] <ziss> ntp?
[02:57] <frantic> i need to switch from unix time to the windows one
[02:57] <vars> hey i want to install a webserver, how can i do this?
[02:57] <frantic> every time i boot windows, my clock is several days off
[02:57] <mothman> 1970..
[02:57] <feetboy16> eddiestone: ???
[02:57] <daryl_> Anyone know how to troubleshoot sound problems with Terminal Server Client?
[02:57] <frantic> vars, look into the apache packages
[02:57] <frantic> in synaptic
[02:58] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[02:58] <ahmeni> feetboy16: odds are all the inodes for your data is gone, so you'll have to take a raw dump of the data and do what you can with it
[02:58] <d33t> frantic: you need to set the right timezone
[02:58] <Marsmensch> vars: sudo apt-get install apache2
[02:58] <feetboy16> alright
[02:58] <d33t> frantic: then you also need to sync the hardware clock
[02:58] <feetboy16> ok i see
[02:58] <feetboy16> thanks
[02:58] <ziss> hi, can anyone tell me where the longhaul module gets loaded from on boot?
[02:58] <frantic> ok, but how
[02:59] <vars> Has anyone setup apache2 on ubuntu?
[02:59] <mothman> it's a bad idea to sync the hardware clock by default I yhink
[02:59] <d33t> frantic - how well do you know the console..... i suspect not well....
[02:59] <frantic> quite well
[02:59] <frantic> i've just never had htis problem
[02:59] <d33t> frantic - ah, good.
[02:59] <d33t> frantic - i have, recently learned how to fix it :)
[03:00] <frantic> excellent
[03:00] <mothman> -_-;
[03:00] <jadaz87> can someone tell me why /media/usbdisk/ does not work on the ubuntu-server install?
[03:00] <d33t> frantic - heh, one sec, let me double-check before i tell you the wrong info
[03:01] <bimberi> vars: yes
=== somegeek_ is now known as somegeek
[03:01] <d33t> frantic - btw, it also has to do with UTC
[03:01] <vars> bimberi, you are my new friend
[03:01] <disinterseted_pe> how do i get my volume to work from the keyboard?
[03:02] <d33t> frantic - cat your /etc/timezone once
[03:02] <d33t> is it right?
[03:02] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: set keyboard shortcuts for them - System -> Preferences
[03:02] <frantic> yes
[03:02] <vars> bimberi, i just installed hoary -server    all i need to do is host a 170 mb webpage
[03:02] <d33t> frantic - do hwclock --show
[03:02] <frantic> Mon 22 May 2006 08:02:50 PM CDT  -0.218684 seconds
[03:03] <vars> i don't care about security i just want to open up the ports and letter rip
[03:03] <frantic> which is correct
[03:03] <d33t> same zone as me :)
[03:03] <disinterseted_pe> ok it says volume down 0xae
[03:03] <frantic> woot, central reprezent
[03:03] <malachi> SiS sucks!
[03:03] <disinterseted_pe> what do i set it to?
[03:03] <bimberi> vars: ok, have you installed the ubuntu package for apache2?
[03:03] <malachi> SiS sucks!
[03:03] <vars> yes
[03:04] <vars> what else do i need?
[03:04] <jadaz87> can someone tell me why /media/usbdisk/ does not work on the ubuntu-server install?
[03:05] <d33t> frantic - it SHOULD be as simple as editing /etc/default/rcS
[03:05] <d33t> change UTC=yes to YTC=no
[03:05] <bimberi> vars: nothing much really, create /var/www/index.html and you should be right
[03:05] <disinterseted_pe> bimberi ?
[03:06] <d33t> and, i must also appologize, i recently learned how to sync HW clock to linux clock, no get the windows time right.....
[03:06] <metrocard> hey all
[03:06] <d33t> you will need to restart the hwclock.sh script
[03:06] <frantic> well... we've got the time zone right
[03:06] <vars> ok lets try it
[03:06] <d33t> frantic - sudo /etc/init.d/hwclock.sh restart
[03:06] <KaosX> jadaz87: can you mount it?
[03:06] <d33t> i'm gonna try it myself actually
[03:06] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: click on the line and set your own shortcut (eg. alt-up)
[03:07] <frantic> uhhh i guess it worked
[03:07] <d33t> although, i'll need to reboot to windows to make sure :)
[03:07] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: ...by hitting the key sequence
[03:07] <d33t> frantic - you gonna reboot or no?
[03:07] <frantic> sooo, windows sets its clock to GMT and linux doesn't?
[03:08] <Venker> hi there :-)
[03:08] <d33t> i thought so
[03:08] <frantic> nah, i'm in the middle of a apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:08] <odin_> does anybody know how I can copy files from my windows partition to linux in ubuntu?
[03:08] <disinterseted_pe> i did and it moves the bar but it doesnt turn the volume up or down
[03:08] <d33t> all good. i'm staying here, i use windows about once every 2 months for something trivial
[03:08] <d33t> no need to reboot, or have the right time
[03:08] <odin_> I downloaded ntfsprogs package, but ntfsmount wasn't included
[03:08] <frantic> yeah
[03:08] <frantic> i wish i could never use windows again
[03:08] <frantic> but, i fancy myself a musician
[03:09] <d33t> but yeah, I thought there was soemthing with the way linux compensates for using UTC/GMT
[03:09] <frantic> and there are some very nice vst instruments that i'd really miss
[03:09] <Arrick> odin_, just copy and paste
[03:09] <d33t> yeah, my friend recently got a mac for that reason. all the pleasure of linux with the wsupport of windows :)
[03:09] <KaosX> ahhh, but the business world requires windows, its a necessary evil, and if it always worked and was secure alot of people would be out of jobs
[03:09] <Arrick> !ntfs
[03:09] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[03:09] <Arrick> odin_, ^^
[03:09] <frantic> if linux doesn't have the tools i want by the time i'm ready to replace this computer, i'll probably defect back to macs too
[03:09] <d33t> if the time is still messed up, sorry, but i think that'll fix it
[03:10] <odin_> Arrick:  how can I access my windows partition from linux?  they're on the same hard drive
[03:10] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: it works on the master volume - check by double-clicking on the volume applet to open the control
[03:10] <KaosX> Im a %60 os X user %30 linux user %10 windows user
[03:10] <frantic> buut i'm a computer scientist and leaving linux would kind of bum me out too
[03:10] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: (for me anyway)
[03:10] <odin_> Arrick:  ooo, a link
[03:10] <eddiestone> warrock will be launched
[03:11] <Eleaf> mmm
[03:11] <disinterseted_pe> where do i find the applet?
[03:11] <d33t> i just like how well linux works, especially ubuntu
[03:11] <d33t> it's as close to using a mac as I can get on a PC....
[03:11] <d33t> :)
[03:11] <frantic> it's so easy because if it ever breaks, it's because of something i just did
[03:11] <wizzlefish> Linux is wonderful, d33t :)
[03:11] <frantic> and usually i can go right back to those config files and undo it
[03:11] <frantic> good as new
[03:11] <d33t> exactly
[03:12] <wizzlefish> I've messed up things I couldn't fix, but I'm no expert on Linux
[03:12] <d33t> and except for the time the caps on my mobo all blew up, I've never had it crash on me, unless I did something stupid to make it crash
[03:12] <KaosX> i think the general mass of people are scared away by the initial shock of the difference (the command line terrifies alot of guys i know), but this is a discussion for offtopic.
=== jhenn_ is now known as jhenn
=== ubuntu is now known as liuwei
[03:12] <d33t> true, true
[03:12] <frantic> wizzlefish, i think you'll learn to cover your ass soon enough
[03:12] <wizzlefish> I think the general mass of people are scared away by monospaced fonts in the terminal
[03:12] <wizzlefish> XD
[03:12] <KaosX> lol
[03:13] <d33t> anyway, i came here for a reason..... i currently have a box running ubuntu with software RAID5..... 4 drives on the array
[03:13] <wizzlefish> I eventually got used to monospace
[03:13] <d33t> anyone know if i can move the array to another machine?
[03:13] <KaosX> I like my green on black sorta transparent terms in linux and osx
[03:13] <wizzlefish> ooh! I want transparency!
[03:13] <wizzlefish> I use eterm mostly
[03:13] <KaosX> its easy
[03:13] <frantic> haha, you could certainly try
[03:14] <d33t> i used to use eterm in gentoo for the sole reson of transparency....
[03:14] <bimberi> disinterseted_pe: the speaker (near the clock) at top right
[03:14] <d33t> i'd like to get XGL going some time soon too, but my nVidia card is a little old
[03:14] <KaosX> I dont like the staight to the desktop style transparency though
[03:15] <benkong2> where is the best place to learn what the kernel options mean if I want to try and build a custom kernel?
[03:15] <KaosX> Do you just want faster support for your hardware?
[03:15] <d33t> benkong2 - the info you see during make menuconfig shoudl help a lot
[03:15] <frantic> installing xgl is actually pretty easy
[03:16] <frantic> do you run dapper drake?
[03:16] <T`> do you guys use a firefox extention to switch proxies?
[03:16] <benkong2> d33t, ok thanks
[03:16] <d33t> frantic - so i'm told, i just haven't done it. i heard the older GeForce cards were a bit of a pain though
[03:16] <ppl> hi
[03:16] <tsume> oi, I've this 80 gig drive and a Toshiba M35-S456. I'm trying to install grub. The laptop had lilo on it, but I'm really trying to get grub on this time. menu.lst does exist and points to (hd0,0). When I try booting it just says "GRUB" and sits there at boot
[03:16] <frantic> hmm
[03:16] <T`> switchproxy seems to really slow down firefox fo rme
[03:16] <frantic> i dunno, maybe
[03:16] <d33t> T - that's the one i use
[03:16] <axlrose> hey guys
[03:16] <tsume> I've always had this problem with just how ubuntu is installing grub
[03:16] <ppl> If I want to setup dual-head, is there a front-end or I must edit xorg.conf directly?
[03:16] <tsume> in the past.. I remember fedora working
[03:16] <frantic> haha
[03:16] <T`> d33t, but thats really slwoing down.. new window opens take like 10-15 secs
[03:16] <frantic> tsume
[03:16] <tsume> so what is the problem with ubuntu's grub?
[03:16] <axlrose> can anyone help me  with a cedega problem?
[03:16] <frantic> i've had that problem
[03:16] <frantic> do you need to know how to fix it?
[03:17] <axlrose> Me?
[03:17] <d33t> T - i never had that happen, seems odd. sure it's not caused by another extension?
[03:17] <tsume> frantic: I don't...  :(
[03:17] <tsume> frantic: I had to install lilo.
[03:17] <disinterseted_pe> ok thanks
[03:17] <frantic> oh
[03:17] <T`> d33t, hmm.. maybe.. i'll try again then
[03:17] <tsume> frantic: I don't know what ubuntu does, but it does it wrong :(
[03:17] <frantic> well, i don't know what ubuntu's grub deal is
[03:17] <frantic> it's a pain in the ass to repair
[03:17] <tsume> well I pop in the livecd and install lilo :)
[03:17] <d33t> tsume, you aren't using an older abit board with a highpoint controller on it, are you?
[03:18] <axlrose> hello?
[03:18] <frantic> you can fix it by booting up the installer cd, getting to the partitioner...
[03:18] <tsume> d33t: hmm, no. Its centrino
[03:18] <frantic> pressing control alt F3 or F2
[03:18] <tsume> d33t: I don't know what chipset is used on this intel board
[03:18] <axlrose> >:|
[03:18] <d33t> tsume - ah. i used to have a problem where grub woudl use the same memory location on the boot sector the the highpoint controller sed, grub always crashed, thought that might be it
[03:18] <tsume> frantic: well I use the livecd for dapper now :)
[03:18] <frantic> cd /dev/long/convoluted/path/to/your/disk/especiallyifyouhaveIDEdrives
[03:18] <axlrose> Is anyone gonna help me with my problem?
[03:18] <frantic> oh, you need to mount it
[03:18] <frantic> then chroot to it
[03:18] <Venker> did anyone configured locales in Ubuntu Dapper?
[03:19] <d33t> tsume - it's not highpoint, i'm pretty sure of that....
[03:19] <odin_> so once I've mounted my windows partition, in order to play a game I just go into xwine and point it to the .exe file for it in that partition?
[03:19] <frantic> then you can use grub-install
[03:19] <tsume> d33t: hmm
[03:19] <odin_> or should I copy it over first?
[03:19] <frantic> and it'll fix it! just like that!
[03:19] <_tcc> Hi
[03:19] <tsume> frantic: what?
[03:19] <disinterseted_pe> i take it theres noway to link the keyboard to volume control?
[03:19] <d33t> tsume - it was an odd case i think.
[03:19] <_tcc> I installed madwifi-ng
[03:19] <tsume> frantic: does it work?
[03:19] <frantic> yes, i've done it twice
[03:19] <_tcc> How can I be 100% sure I am using madwifi-ng and not madwifi?
[03:19] <tsume> frantic: hmm
[03:19] <jadaz87> odin: wine "/path/to/exe/program.exe"
[03:19] <frantic> you might have trouble if your boot partition is seperate from /
[03:19] <odin_> is there a list of windows games that work in xwine?
[03:19] <tsume> frantic: they are on the same partition
[03:19] <tsume> frantic: what command did you issue?
[03:20] <jadaz87> odin http://appdb.winhq.org
[03:20] <frantic> ok, then it should work no problem
[03:20] <d33t> T - looking quick, there is a new extension called "foxyproxy", you try that
[03:20] <frantic> let me find the page where i got the instructions and you can just read that
[03:20] <_tcc> I installed madwifi-ng
[03:20] <_tcc> How can I be 100% sure I am using madwifi-ng and not madwifi?
[03:20] <tsume> grub-install --root=/boot/grub /dev/hda1?
[03:20] <_tcc> ??
[03:20] <odin_> thanks, jadaz87
[03:20] <axlrose> how do i get into the wine C:/ folder?
[03:20] <axlrose> what's the path
[03:20] <odin_> jadaz87: um, I think that site is dead
[03:20] <axlrose> c:/ drive i mean
[03:20] <_tcc> its like ~/.win
[03:20] <_tcc> its like ~/.wine
[03:20] <_tcc> or something like that
[03:20] <axlrose> kk
[03:21] <KillerKiwi2006> how come every time i get a new kernal the resume=/dev/hda4 dissapers from grub
[03:21] <axlrose> nevermind
[03:21] <Managu_away> _tcc: madwifi is a kernel module, no?  Just unload it
[03:21] <axlrose> that's not gonna do anything
[03:21] <tsume> frantic: did you install on the MBR or first boot block?
[03:21] <amphi> KillerKiwi2006: you haven't added it in the right place
[03:21] <axlrose> I'm having problems with Cedega with Silent hill 2

[03:25] <axlrose> and he moved
[03:25] <axlrose> :<
[03:25] <Managu> axlrose: heh, he'd probably be the person to ask, then ;-)
[03:25] <vars> for putting a website on the internet.
[03:25] <axlrose> See above ^
[03:25] <d33t> axlrose, does he have a phone ;P
[03:25] <bimberi> cubikdice: note the second last letter is a "c"
[03:25] <axlrose> Lost his phone
[03:25] <axlrose> :<
[03:25] <d33t> ha, man, luck really is against you
[03:26] <axlrose> yeah
[03:26] <Managu> axlrose: this friend is sounding more and more imaginary
[03:26] <axlrose> nah
[03:26] <axlrose> I'm a loner for the most part
[03:26] <axlrose> D:
[03:26] <cubikdice> -_- thanks bimberi
[03:26] <Flannel> vars: so, what do you have so far?  apache's all setup?
[03:26] <bimberi> cubikdice: np :)
[03:26] <axlrose> think xwine will work managu??
[03:26] <tsume> Flannel: hmmm
[03:26] <vars> i don't know for shure
[03:27] <tsume> frantic: hmmmm, I'll try again
[03:27] <bimberi> vars: have you tried it from a browser?
[03:27] <axlrose> think if i install it with xwine?
[03:27] <Flannel> vars: alright, this isn't on your machine, right
[03:27] <vars> yes it is
[03:27] <_tcc> lsmod shows nothing regarding madwifi or madwifi-ng
[03:27] <_tcc> just ath_hal
[03:27] <_tcc> just ath_pci
[03:27] <vars> wait
[03:27] <vars> just a second
[03:27] <Flannel> vars: it is on the machine youre on currently? or not?
[03:27] <snerfu> Is it possible to do an FTP install without much hassle?
[03:27] <Managu> axlrose: never heard of it
[03:27] <vars> no this is my wifes
[03:28] <vars> the one i am typing on
[03:28] <axlrose> kk
[03:28] <_tcc> snerfu, FTP install?
[03:28] <Flannel> vars: so, you have two machines? ok.  Youre on a LAN, with some sort of home router?
[03:28] <axlrose> is there a cedega IRC?
[03:28] <axlrose> That would probably be best
[03:28] <vars> Flannel, yes
[03:28] <Managu> snerfu: Debian can pull off a net install, but I don't know if it's a supported install method for Ubuntu
[03:28] <d33t> ok, i will ask again..... anyone know anything about moving software RAID arrays to other machines?
[03:28] <_tcc> oyh netinstall
[03:28] <Flannel> vars: alright, do you know the IP of the server? from your LAN? should be soemthing 192.168...
[03:28] <snerfu> Yeah, the CD drive in my laptop only works enough to boot up and fails a little into the cd install.
[03:28] <vars> how do i use wget to download a webpage
[03:28] <lastnode> when i try to apt-get remove totem, it tries to remove ubuntu-desktop as well. what goes?
[03:28] <scared> how can I automount my usb key when I plug it ?
[03:29] <axlrose> snerfu
[03:29] <axlrose> is your cd scratched at all?
[03:29] <d33t> lastnode: it's a virtual dependancy
[03:29] <Flannel> vars: wget [url] 
[03:29] <axlrose> or scuffed?
[03:29] <axlrose> I've had that problem
[03:29] <axlrose> just windex it
[03:29] <snerfu> I have done the ftp install of debian before.
[03:29] <Flannel> lastnode: ubuntu-desktop is a meta package
[03:29] <bimberi> vars: wget http://192.168.0.10   (for example)
[03:29] <axlrose> and clean it off
[03:29] <vars> ok
[03:29] <Flannel> snerfu: ubuntu isn't debian.
[03:29] <lastnode> d33t: how can i remove it? totem sucks, i want to remove everything related with it so my media doesnt automatically try to open in it.i use xine.
[03:29] <snerfu> No axlrose I have tried many other distributions cd's.
[03:29] <axlrose> oh
[03:29] <snerfu> all the same problem.
[03:29] <axlrose> probably a bad cd drive
[03:30] <d33t> lastnode - check out the "unoffical ubuntu guide"
[03:30] <lastnode> d33t: got a url?
[03:30] <snerfu> I know it isn't Flannel, I was just asking if there was something similar to give you a point of reference.
[03:30] <d33t> if you can make sense of the mplayer hacking, you can override totem
[03:30] <d33t> yeah, one sec
[03:30] <Managu> snerfu: I've got a laptop with the same sort of problem.  I was able to get the "damn small linux" live cd running fine, if that's any help.
[03:30] <d33t> ubuntu 5.10?
[03:30] <Flannel> lastnode: yes, meta packages are fine for removal.  They're just groups of packages.
[03:30] <lastnode> d33t: dapper
[03:30] <vars> Flannel, i have a modem that comes in
[03:30] <d33t> ah
[03:30] <lastnode> Flannel: oh ok, so it wont remove gnome for me?

[03:31] <axlrose> on shipit
[03:31] <axlrose> when will it get here do you think? (I live in the Northwest)
[03:31] <snerfu> I have read that method where you could boot off the livecd and go through the install kind of like you do on gentoo.
[03:31] <Flannel> vars: right, and then how do you connect both machines to the DSL modem?
[03:31] <tritium> snerfu: only on dapper
[03:31] <snerfu> manually doing what the installer does.
[03:31] <snerfu> oh
[03:31] <coz_> sorry again for repeat but this is screenshot of firends desktop with the fat32 drive plugged in and you can see name of device as "le></form>" andy sugestions       http://darkedut.tripod.com/snapproblem.png

[03:32] <vars> no
[03:32] <goethe> Can somebody tell me if xgl uses different xorg.conf??  because I noticed that under "regular" gnome I get direct rendering (known from glxfinfo) but when i use xgl/compiz and i type in glxinfo | grep direct it shows that i don't have direct rendering
[03:32] <Managu> axlrose: Google reports that #cedega on freenode is Cedega's support channel.
[03:32] <Flannel> vars: so, you have a router?
[03:33] <Flannel> vars: oh, your DSL modem has both USB and CAT connection?
[03:33] <vars> i guess so

[03:33] <axlrose> managu: silence so far
[03:33] <axlrose> lol
[03:33] <goethe> by the way i'm using ati mobile 7500
[03:33] <Flannel> vars: does the modem support that?  most dont.
[03:33] <d33t> lastnode - it has to do with modifying your /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
[03:33] <vars> Flannel, yes my dsl modem has both usb and cat 5
[03:33] <lastnode> d33t: thanks
[03:33] <Flannel> vars: right, but can you connect to both at the same time?
[03:33] <d33t> lastnode - some more info here http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu
[03:33] <d33t> look around the part about overriding with mplayer
[03:33] <vars> does the modem support what?  yes i am on the internet with both right now
[03:34] <d33t> you SHOULD be able to change it to xine
[03:34] <siriusnova> anyone here an expert with Ubuntu/Gnome keyring?
[03:34] <cocox> anybody knows or have a document were says in wish directories get installed the packages .deb after make an dpkg -i xxx.deb ????
[03:34] <d33t> if you're comfortable with what you're doing
[03:34] <Flannel> vars: alright, so, the modem has a built in router?
[03:34] <goethe> Anyone??
[03:34] <lastnode> d33t: thanks mate, im just using this ubuntu install until i get my gentoo partition setup anyway
[03:35] <Flannel> vars: check your modems manual, I really don't think that is supported, let alone being able to configure traffic flow
[03:35] <d33t> lastnode - nice, i used to be a gentoo guy myself, but i don't have time to tinker much anymore, and ubuntu works well out of the box...... btw, is dapper out of beta yet?
[03:35] <lullabud> vars: what model of modem are you using?
[03:35] <vars> i have to change the /etc/resolv.conf to nameserver 4.2.2.1 every time   if that helps
[03:35] <tsume> frantic: what type is your main partition?
[03:36] <alanlaptop> dapper june 1
[03:36] <d33t> ah, soon
[03:36] <vars> it is an actiontec   gt-701 gw
[03:36] <alanlaptop> flight 7 is pretty smooth already
[03:36] <lullabud> that will support both if you use the correct firmware.
[03:37] <disinterseted_pe> how do i set a default media player?
[03:37] <frantic> tsume, what?
[03:37] <lullabud> vars: i think the newer firmwares disable one or the other, but there may be a configuration setting in the web UI to allow both.  there used to be.
[03:37] <frantic> what do you mean by main partition
[03:37] <goethe> Can somebody tell me if xgl uses different xorg.conf??  because I noticed that under "regular" gnome I get direct rendering (known from glxfinfo) but when i use xgl/compiz and i type in glxinfo | grep direct it shows that i don't have direct rendering
[03:37] <tsume> frantic: where your /boot is located
[03:37] <Flannel> vars: you'll need to figure out how to forward ports to one or other other machiens
[03:37] <d33t> disinterseted_pe: modify /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
[03:37] <tsume> frantic: its still frozen at GRUB
[03:37] <lastnode> d33t: im not sure, im installing from a flight5 cd. ill have to dist-upgrade soon. i usually run debian etch / gentoo dual boot, but lawrence lessig is in town today, and i want to go hear him speak. i b0rked my disk so i had to dd it last night.
[03:37] <frantic> it's the second partition on my disk
[03:37] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, totem should already be set as your default, for most formats
[03:37] <frantic> it's primary
[03:37] <lullabud> vars: it's easy to forward ports if you have the right firmware.
[03:37] <hugo> hola
[03:37] <frantic> i think it can be logical...
[03:37] <tsume> frantic: oh, so you dual boot?
[03:37] <frantic> yeah
[03:38] <frantic> windows must be first
[03:38] <tsume> frantic: I'm just trying to install linux  :/
[03:38] <d33t> lastnode: at least yo ugot it runnign again. hope you didn't lose anything.....
[03:38] <disinterseted_pe> mudpilot it wont work for streamlink though
[03:38] <frantic> oh
[03:38] <disinterseted_pe> i a terminal?
[03:38] <alanlaptop> vars may have modem and router both running NAT turn off on modem and it will work if so, common in bellsouth setups

[03:39] <lullabud> cocox: do an updatedb && locate xxx.deb
[03:39] <vars> ok my www.209.181.2.222 tells me i can forward ports
[03:39] <lastnode> d33t: ive heard good things about unison. :) im debating whether to debootstrap etch now or wait till i get to the conference
[03:39] <lastnode> i think ill wait
[03:40] <lullabud> vars: is 209.181.2.222 the IP# of the modem or your PC?
[03:40] <lastnode> d33t: i might just keep this ubuntu install if i can kill the boot time a little. remove some inits
[03:40] <nullspace> any one have luck with xgl and compiz lately
[03:40] <d33t> heh, if you have something running now, leave it alone until after you need it, that's what i learned :)
[03:40] <vars> for apache i know i need to do have the ports 80 and 443
[03:40] <nullspace> it seems that alot of the mirriors are down
[03:41] <goethe> Can somebody tell me if xgl uses different xorg.conf??  because I noticed that under "regular" gnome I get direct rendering (known from glxfinfo) but when i use xgl/compiz and i type in glxinfo | grep direct it shows that i don't have direct rendering
[03:41] <lastnode> d33t: good call. :)
[03:41] <vars> it is the modem i think because i can use it for each comp
[03:41] <d33t> yeah, that's the only downfall, boot time. there's stuff in the forum howto's about making it faster though, but i haven't played with it
[03:41] <Flannel> vars: only if you want http and https
[03:41] <Mr> Can anyone help me with a problem i am having.  I got the KDE packages off APT , but my font is really small  in certain applications and the terminal.  I changed the font through Kcontrol and it only worked on a few apps.  Everything was fin @ this resolution in GNOME
[03:41] <d33t> i only reboot once a week at most, usually more like once a month

[03:42] <d33t> most of it shoudl be pretty straight forward
[03:43] <lullabud> mr: try #kubuntu
[03:43] <frantic> \m/ vim \m/
[03:43] <disinterseted_pe> theres nothing in the list
[03:43] <d33t> like audio/mpeg

[03:43] <sip> ok, tks & how can I save it in my list couse i have a bit problem with my keyboard
[03:43] <lullabud> vars: you have to go into the web UI for the router, then tell ports 80 and 443 to forward to the 192.168.x.x address of the server you're running.
[03:43] <lullabud> mr: no that's a channel.  /join #kubuntu
[03:44] <Desh> What should a normal user's primary group be? And should admin be a secondary group?
[03:44] <Mr> ohh thanks

[03:44] <sip> primary

[03:45] <Yanlowen> HELP, I accidently deleted part of the desktop, is there anyway I can get it back without a complete reinstall, only one file that I am aware of
[03:45] <Flannel> Yanlowen: what did you delete?
[03:45] <disinterseted_pe> when i had totem and mplayer in the same file i got 1 stream station to work
[03:45] <lullabud> Yanlowen: what file?
[03:46] <Yanlowen> I am not sure, it is the file that loads the desktop icon in the lower left corner
[03:46] <lastnode_> where does nautilus populate the drives list from? i have 6 floppy drives
[03:46] <lullabud> 6 floppy drives??
[03:46] <Yanlowen> the one that allows you to maximize and minimize windows
[03:47] <lullabud> lastnode_ you actually *HAVE* 6??
[03:47] <lastnode_> lullabud: i dont! i just went in /media/ and rm-rf floppy* but nautilus still shows them
[03:47] <lullabud> lastnode_: oooooh, haha, i thought that's what you had and they weren't showing up
[03:47] <d33t> lastnode, i think it uses the device list, but i'm not sure
[03:48] <lullabud> no, it doesn't use the device list.
[03:48] <cocox> is there a way to know the ip address of my buddies in the messenger ??
[03:48] <Yanlowen> I guess that is not a really good description of the file is it?
[03:48] <d33t> heh, i guess i was wrong :)
[03:48] <lastnode_> d33t: where is it? little things like this really drive me nuts
[03:48] <d33t> do you see 6 floppy drives on the desktop?
[03:49] <d33t> or just in /media?
[03:49] <lastnode_> d33t: no just in 'Computer'
[03:49] <lastnode_> i rm -r from /media
[03:49] <disinterseted_pe> ok how do i install mplayer plug-in-3.25.tar.gz?
[03:49] <d33t> yeah, i don't know where it gets the list from
[03:49] <lullabud> lastnode_ what's in /etc/fstab ?
[03:49] <d33t> that's part of the ubuntu magic i take for granted
[03:49] <d33t> actually, yeah
[03:49] <moonysuny> join #ubuntu-cn
[03:49] <d33t> /etc/fstab

[03:50] <d33t> hi
[03:50] <ubuntu> i install live cd to repair grub boot loader
[03:50] <lullabud> dapper is really shaping up....
[03:50] <ubuntu> how to repair it?
[03:50] <T`> guys.. how do i lock my screen when the laptop goes into suspend/hibernate?
[03:51] <ubuntu> i'am now in the window of ubuntu/
[03:51] <ubuntu> where should i go to install grub
[03:51] <lastnode_> i hate /media anyway, so i just had it mount the cd-rom in /mnt/
[03:51] <ubuntu> coz my grub is overwriten by window s xp
[03:51] <ubuntu> i want it to go back
[03:51] <lullabud> T`: ctrl-alt-L
[03:51] <lastnode_> ubuntu: livecd?
=== lastnode_ is now known as lastnode
[03:51] <ubuntu> b4 i hav installed ubuntu install cd
[03:52] <T`> lullabud, no, it should be automatic.. like when i close my lid
[03:52] <ubuntu> in partition d:
[03:52] <lastnode> ubuntu: if you already have ubuntu installed, just boot from a lilo cd and run grub
[03:52] <ubuntu> and since when i reinstall my xp
[03:52] <amphi> !grub
[03:52] <ubotu> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
[03:52] <Yanlowen> okay I know this is a strange question, but I deleted a file that creates the icon that goes in the lower left corner of the ubuntu windows manager screen, can I reload it?
[03:52] <amphi> ubuntu: ^^^
[03:52] <d33t> ubuntu; if you do the install and choose "advanced" you should be able to re-run the boot loader section only
[03:52] <lullabud> T`: oooh, that's system -> preferences -> screensaver
[03:52] <lastnode> does anyone know of a way to hack gnome to display the applications menu in right click?
[03:53] <RemyHome> hi guys, where's a good collection of art (system, desktops, themes, etc) for ubuntu / gnome ?
[03:53] <d33t> lastnode: why not switch to what you really want..... *box
[03:53] <d33t> (i assume)
[03:53] <amphi> T`: you can have the acpi script call xscreensaver-command lock or summat; you need some xauth stuff probably, but I think that's in there already
[03:53] <d33t> or wm
[03:53] <d33t> or.... enlightenment do that?
[03:53] <lastnode> d33t: gnome comes the battery applets etc
[03:53] <lastnode> *with
[03:53] <lastnode> and im lazy atm to config them in anotherwm
[03:53] <d33t> true, true
[03:54] <d33t> that's kinda why i havent' gone back to openbox myself :)
[03:54] <amphi> lastnode: I use openbox with gkrellm
[03:54] <tsume> frantic: I find the whole thing odd, it just sticks at GRUB

[04:00] <lullabud> d33t: i really don't know for sure, but i would imagine you'd have to edit the conf to point to the correct /dev/ locations, but that might be what mdrun does.
[04:00] <d33t> right, i'd think that too

[04:03] <ubuntu> how to change it back
[04:04] <Pyru> Hello , I installed webmin , and want to remove it but cannot seem to uninstall it
[04:04] <amphi> ubuntu: hd(0,1) is correct for stage1
[04:04] <NickGarvey> stage1?
[04:05] <NickGarvey> sounds like gentoo talk to me
[04:05] <amphi> NickGarvey: grub talk
[04:05] <NickGarvey> oh okie dokie
[04:05] <amphi> NickGarvey: no cause for alarm ;)
[04:05] <Managu> grub seems to be getting an inordinate amount of attention of late
[04:05] <NickGarvey> _root: I would suggest against loggin in as root during irc
[04:06] <_root> Hi, I'm logged as root currently, what do I have to make the primary group of a user in order for them to be able to use sudo and su?
[04:06] <amphi> Managu: yeah, it's always been pretty 'fire & forget' for me
[04:06] <_root> Yeah I know, but I quickly need to set this.
[04:06] <cocox> how can i list the services running in my computer ??
[04:06] <NickGarvey> okied dokie
[04:06] <Managu> _root: users need to be added to the "wheel" group to be able to sudo and su
[04:06] <cubikdice> _root, you ideot! get off r00t!
[04:06] <amphi> cocox: network?
[04:06] <lastnode> _root: why are you on irc as root? do you have a death wish? 0.o
[04:06] <NickGarvey> _root: yeah wheel would work
[04:06] <frantic> tsume, i messaged it to you
[04:07] <cocox> amphi, yes the services running over my pc ... like samba dun know...
[04:07] <_root> I don't have that group.
[04:07] <_root> o_O
[04:07] <amphi> sudo cocox: netstat -plunt
[04:07] <NickGarvey> _root: odd..
[04:07] <amphi> cocox: er, sudo netstat -plunt ;)
[04:07] <Pyru> Hello , I installed webmin , and want to remove it but cannot seem to uninstall it
[04:07] <NickGarvey> _root: "man visudo"
[04:07] <Managu> _root: when you type in "uname -a", what do you get?
[04:07] <_root> My normal user was running fine, but I could not edit files on USB drives, while trying to access fstab su stopped working.
[04:07] <bimberi> _root: admin group for sudo (secondary is fine)
[04:07] <cocox> amphi, thnxxxx :)
[04:08] <amphi> cocox: yw
[04:08] <_root> Linux Hotwax 2.6.12-10-k7 #1 Fri Apr 28 13:58:48 UTC 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
[04:08] <Taru> Please check this out, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14505
[04:08] <Managu> _root, mmkay, just curious
[04:09] <Managu> Taru: looks rather boring.  But it's a brilliant comment!
[04:09] <amphi> Taru: what does it mean?
[04:09] <_root> I accidentally changed the primary user group for my normal user.
[04:09] <Taru> Managu, My Gnome Terminal will stop working, why?
[04:09] <odin_> man I am freakin' hot
[04:09] <frantic> ASL LOL
[04:09] <Taru> amphi, I am having trouble starting Gnome terminal.
[04:09] <jjazz> I am trying to get gdm to show me an xdmcp chooser.  I believe I've selected the right gdmsetup options, but I don't see any option to run a chooser at the login screen.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.
[04:09] <bimberi> _root: that's usually the group with the same name as the user
[04:10] <odin_> I am so moving to Canada, nice cooling system there
[04:10] <_root> I need to know what it was, because unless I add admin as secondary I cannot access sudo or su, but when I do this it does not ask for passwords.
[04:10] <amphi> Taru: you might need to put the %f in single quotes
[04:10] <lastnode_> sorry, i timed out. anyway to run a program at startup?
[04:10] <Taru> amphi, ok thanks, I will try that.
[04:10] <amphi> frantic: ASLU I think you mean
[04:11] <_root> Ok so I made the primary group the same as the user name. What should I have as secondary groups for su and sudo to work?
[04:11] <frantic> uhhh age sex location ubuntuversion?
[04:11] <Taru> amphi, Hmm.. doesn't work.
[04:11] <frantic> works for me i guess!
[04:11] <Taru> amphi, I run the gnome terminal and it disappears seconds after launch.
[04:11] <amphi> frantic: you don't want to know their uptime?? ;)
[04:11] <NickGarvey> haha
[04:11] <cocox> amphi, why when i list the services running in my pc with "nmap 127.0.0.1" i get a different output from doing "netstat -plunt"  ????
[04:12] <frantic> oh haha
[04:12] <disinterseted_pe> ok, madpilot how do i install mplayerplug in 3.25.tar.gz?
[04:12] <amphi> cocox: I believe nmap is not reliable on the loopback interface, but I could be wrong
[04:12] <bimberi> _root: for sudo it needs admin.  Use of su isn't group related - just knowledge of the root password
[04:12] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, sorry, how do you do what?
[04:13] <mathieu_> what is the name of the app to setup printer on ubuntu ?
[04:13] <disinterseted_pe> how do i install mplayer plugin 3.25.tar.gz?
[04:13] <_root> Ok, well, when I tried using su, such as in Admin mode in the system settings it would says "conversation with su failed"
[04:13] <Madpilot> _root, if you're really running as root while you're connected to the interenet, that's not a good idea..
[04:13] <NickGarvey> !tell _root about root
[04:13] <mathieu_> that is in the default gnome setup on ubuntu dapper
[04:13] <bimberi> mathieu_: gnome-cups-manager
[04:13] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, do you mean the mplayer plugin for firefox?
[04:14] <disinterseted_pe> ive got it dled to my desktop
[04:14] <disinterseted_pe> yes
[04:14] <cocox> amphi, mmmm i m not sure either
[04:14] <amphi> cocox: nmap shows more or less?
[04:14] <bimberi> mathieu_: yes, System -> Administration -> Printing
[04:14] <Managu> _root: if you're running Ubuntu, you generally shouldn't have a whole bunch of use for "su".  I'd suggest you test getting "sudo" working properly first
[04:14] <amphi> cocox: I'd believe netstat
[04:14] <_root> So I need admin as secondary group?
[04:14] <Madpilot> disinterseted_pe, I think you want the mozilla-mplayer plugin from Ubuntu's repositories (I don't run Firefox, so I'm not actually sure...)
[04:15] <mathieu_> bimberi: i am not in gnome though, that is why i need the appname
[04:15] <disinterseted_pe> ok
[04:15] <Managu> _root: yes, your user needs to be in the admin group
=== blank_ is now known as Griswald
[04:15] <daddius> hey peoples
[04:15] <daddius> anyone good in perl?
[04:15] <disinterseted_pe> ive installed i think all of them from the depository
[04:15] <daddius> or know of any output lib ?
[04:15] <lastnode_> someone mentioned gkrellm here. is he/she around?
[04:15] <daddius> well not lib but perl module
[04:15] <Managu> daddius: tried searching CPAN?
[04:16] <Madpilot> daddius, I think there's a #perl channel
[04:16] <_root> Ok thanks. hope this works. :)
[04:16] <Taru> amphi, Any idea how to get my terminal to function normally again?
[04:16] <xerophyte> i have install slapd and phpldapadmin .. the ldap server is running and i can access the phpldapadmin but i am not abl eto login with admin and the password .. is there anything i can do login
[04:16] <bimberi> mathieu_: gnome-cups-manager is the app, kde has something else, otherwise you can enable admin access to the cups web interface ...
[04:17] <bimberi> ubotu tell mathieu_ about cupsweb
[04:17] <tsume> frantic: your not identified :)
[04:17] <jksd> hi, my machine stalls for quite a long period at 'configuring network interfaces' on bootup, is this normal?
[04:17] <tsume> frantic: I can't see messages from unidentified users
[04:18] <Managu> jksd: it's symptomatic of a network problem
[04:18] <frantic> oh i see
[04:18] <sflash> im trying to mount a file in my fstab file
[04:18] <jksd> Managu: how do I fix?
[04:18] <sflash> cant get it to work
[04:18] <Managu> jksd: errm depends on the problem
[04:18] <bimberi> jksd: yes, for example if it's set to look for a DHCP server and there isn't one available - it will time out - you can interrupt this with CTRL-C
[04:18] <jksd> Managu: how do I diagnose?
[04:18] <pvd2006_> I seem to have my other name logged on, will it automatically log off?
[04:18] <jksd> ah OK
[04:18] <jksd> I'll check my network settings
[04:19] <frantic> uhhhh
[04:19] <matheus> hello
[04:19] <frantic> PASTEBIN
[04:19] <matheus> I have a problem with oss sound
[04:19] <sflash> i added /dev/sda    /home/siavash/USB_drive1   rw,user,auto,umask=002  0   0
[04:19] <Madpilot> pvd2006, use ghost - /msg nickserv help (and then /msg nickserv help ghost)
[04:19] <matheus> alse and esd works
[04:20] <cocox> amphi, nmap show less.... why should u believe netstat ??
[04:20] <matheus> but some applications that have only oss suport dont work
[04:20] <matheus> the device /dev/dsp not found
[04:20] <jksd> bimberi: where can I find infos on DHCP?
[04:20] <matheus> who can help me??
=== pvd2006_ is now known as pvd2006
[04:21] <pvd2006> ah there we go:) thanks
[04:21] <Managu> cocox: netstat tells you how your programs think they're talking to the outside world.  nmap tells you how the outside world views you on some interface.  If you want to know how someone views you, i.e. over your ethernet card, probing the loopback interface isn't really helpful.
[04:22] <bimberi> jksd: System -> Administration -> Preferences - or by editing /etc/network/interfaces - or did you mean documentation?
[04:22] <frantic> tsume???
[04:22] <matheus> anyone can help with sound configuration ??
[04:22] <Managu> cocox: and the IP address 127.0.0.1 is bound to the loopback interface
[04:22] <jksd> bimberi: nah I meant turning it off
[04:22] <frantic> i'll have a pastebin link of my cfdisk stuff in a second
[04:22] <bimberi> jksd: oops, not Preferences - Networking
[04:23] <jksd> bimberi: I already checked that, I'll try again
[04:23] <odin_> why is it that all of a sudden I can
[04:23] <bimberi> jksd: ah, set up a Static IP address in there
[04:23] <matheus> please... I cant see /dev/dsp
[04:23] <Desh> Ok, not logged as root. :)
[04:23] <odin_> 't access my root directories from my user directory?
[04:23] <tsume> frantic: can you paste it to rafb or pastebub??
[04:23] <tsume> frantic: pastebin
[04:23] <frantic> http://pastebin.com/732352
[04:23] <matheus> but alse and esd works
[04:23] <matheus> alsa
[04:24] <frantic> i think it's kind of strange that it lists the partitions out of order...
[04:24] <frantic> cfdisk does
[04:24] <tsume> fhmm
[04:24] <tsume> frantic: df ?
[04:24] <Desh> Ok, I am running Kubuntu, but people seem more knowledgable here. ;) When I run things like the updater, in my case Adept, it usually asked me for a pas. now that I added admin as a secondary group, it doesn't ask for one anymore. Same with using Admin mode in the SYSTEM SETTINGS window, etc.
[04:24] <frantic> sure
[04:24] <frantic> one sec
[04:25] <Desh> And sudo in the command prompt doesn;t require a pass either.
[04:25] <cocox> Managu, so what should i test instead my loopback interface to do a good implementation of nmap ??
[04:25] <slavik> Desh: yes it does ... after the timeout
[04:25] <Managu> cocox: what's your objective?
[04:25] <Desh> Well I just restarted the PC, meaning it should ask the moment I used sudo, but it didn't.
[04:26] <amphi> cocox: because, as I said, nmap is not reliable on localhost AFAIK, and netstat is the canonical tool ;)
[04:26] <lastnode_> what's the best way to make an application load at startup?
=== lastnode_ is now known as lastnode
[04:26] <odin_> can or cannot wine play games that were made for win98?
[04:26] <jksd> bimberi: on which device?
[04:26] <odin_> I'm rather confused
[04:26] <mathieu_> how do i know my default cups username and password ?
[04:26] <cocox> amphi, Managu, mi objetive is to realize why netstat tells me something and nmap another things... :S
[04:27] <matheus> who can help me to setup OSS sound ???? please!!!!!
[04:27] <haasteem> hi, is there anybody here who tried to install qtiplot from source? i'm havbing trouble with it...
[04:27] <Managu> cocox: happen to know the ip address your ethernet card has assigned?
[04:27] <bimberi> jksd: Ethernet
[04:27] <Managu> cocox: i.e. if you run "ifconfig", what's the ip address corresponding to your ethernet card?
[04:27] <cocox> Managu, my private ip is 192.168.1.2
[04:27] <Desh> >_<
[04:27] <Managu> cocox: try nmapping that address
[04:28] <frantic> tsume: http://pastebin.com/732356
[04:28] <mjsabbot> any vpn guru's around?
[04:28] <Desh> Can anyone help me with my sudo/su problem?
[04:28] <amphi> cocox: what is the difference? and why would you use nmap on localhost?
[04:28] <slavik> Desh: what's the problem?
[04:28] <jksd> bimberi: shouldn't it be left as DHCP?
[04:29] <cocox> Managu, amphi, what'd be the difference between 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.2 both refers to my ethernet card isnt it ?
[04:29] <jksd> bimberi: so it grabs whatever it's mean to be?
[04:29] <jksd> bimberi: mean/meant
[04:29] <Managu> cocox: nope
[04:29] <amphi> cocox: it could be that nmap is only seeing things listening on 127.0.0.1, and you have something[s]  only listening on external address[es]  and not on the loopback
[04:29] <Desh> ok slavik, I accidentaly changed my primary user to sudo, it made my normal user unusable since sudo and su did not work. Now I made my primary user group the same as my username, and added admin in the secondary group because only then would sudo and su work. But now they do not ask for a pass.
[04:29] <tsume> frantic: hmm, maybe I need to create a separate partition for /boot
[04:29] <jksd> bimberi: or is it not actually doing that
[04:29] <bimberi> jksd: yes, if that's what you want.  I was illustrating one of the reasons for startup pausing on that message :)
[04:29] <tsume> frantic: I'll try again and see what happens :)
[04:29] <frantic> i don't think it's absolutely necessary
[04:30] <amphi> cocox: they're different interaces, as ifconfig will show you
[04:30] <Desh> slavik: Thinks like the updater, system settings, command line, etc do not ask for a pass.
[04:30] <frantic> but you might have better luck if your boot stuff was on a primary partition
[04:30] <jksd> bimberi: so it's not actually an error, it's just taking it's time?
[04:30] <Pyru> Hello could someone help me uninstall this webmin, I cant seem to uninstall it
[04:30] <bimberi> jksd: what's the nature of your internet connection?
[04:30] <cocox> Managu, amphi, mmm i thought that 127.0.0.1 would give me the same results than 192.168.1.2
[04:30] <slavik> desh, change all the groups back
[04:30] <jksd> bimberi: eth0
[04:30] <amphi> cocox: did you try? ;)
[04:30] <slavik> oh, I see
[04:30] <bimberi> jksd: to a local router of some sort?
[04:30] <Desh> slavik: problem is I don;t know what they were supposed to be
[04:30] <cocox> Managu, amphi, so for what should i just use the loopback ??
[04:30] <jksd> bimberi: broadband
[04:30] <Desh> slavik: I changed hem due to a misclick
[04:30] <mjsabbot> anybody good with IPSEC/openwswan?
[04:31] <slavik> Desh: where did you change the primary user? change the primary user back to your user
[04:31] <Pyru> Hello could someone help me uninstall this webmin, I cant seem to uninstall it please and thtank you
[04:31] <matheus> please!!!! anyone can help me with OSS ??
[04:31] <disinterseted_pe> does the mozilla browser work well?
[04:31] <Desh> slavik: right, it's set as that
[04:31] <amphi> cocox: ifconfig lo down and see what breaks ;)
[04:31] <Managu> cocox: Upshot: understanding TCP/IP, and it's Linux or Unix interfaces, is complicated.  Asking for a thorough tutorial in the Ubuntu support channel isn't really the right avenue.  Go get a good book on the topic.
[04:31] <slavik> good
[04:31] <Desh> slavik: but unless I add admin as a secondary user sudo will not work
[04:31] <slavik> root should belong to root
[04:31] <cocox> Managu, amphi, yes i try it and now i see that there are some differents ip
[04:31] <tsume> frantic: thansk, I'll play with it
[04:31] <bimberi> jksd: hmmk, that probably needs dhcp then.
[04:31] <Desh> slavik: but then I do not get asked for my pass
[04:31] <tsume> frantic: worst off I install lilo :)
[04:31] <bimberi> jksd: broadband modem or broadband router?
[04:32] <frantic> hehe yeah
[04:32] <jksd> bimberi: modem
[04:32] <amphi> cocox: if you want a tcp/ip book, Stevens' 'TCP/IP Iluustrated vol. 1' is good
[04:32] <cocox> Managu, amphi, can you plz tell ubotu something ?
[04:32] <amphi> cocox: er, Illustrated
[04:32] <Desh> slavik: and sudo as secondary user group does not make sudo work
[04:32] <amphi> cocox: can't you? what?
[04:32] <bimberi> jksd: kk, i wonder how your PC gets it's IP then
[04:32] <Managu> !botsnack
[04:32] <ubotu> :)
[04:32] <slavik> Desh: pastebin your /etc/sudoers file
[04:33] <jksd> bimberi: not through DHCP?
[04:33] <cocox> !tell cocox about loopback
[04:33] <Managu> bimberi, jksd: is it possible that there's a built-in ethernet card on jksd's machine that's not being used?
[04:34] <slavik> anyone know where the browser.xul file is kept?
[04:34] <Managu> jksd: are you IRC'ing from the Ubuntu machine?
[04:34] <slavik> nvm
[04:34] <cocox> !tell cocox about 127.0.0.1
[04:34] <cocox> !tell cocox about tcpip
[04:35] <bimberi> Managu, jksd: that's a thought, that would show up in the Networking applet
[04:35] <jksd> yeah, I'm in ubuntu
[04:35] <Desh> slavik: can;t find it...
[04:35] <amphi> cocox: have a look at a networking howto at tldp.org perhaps
[04:36] <jksd> I only have 1 ethernet card though
[04:36] <slavik>  /etc/sudoers ???
[04:36] <slavik> it's a text file
[04:36] <Managu> jksd: if you're connecting through a dial-up modem, and not through the ethernet port, then a delay at the dhcp step isn't too unusual
[04:36] <amphi> cocox: here's summat for you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback_interface
=== linuxer is now known as kakadiya
[04:37] <jksd> Managu: ahh, I do have a regular 56k modem on here, it must be that
[04:37] <Managu> jksd: if you're getting a long delay at that step, but everything else works fine, I wouldn't worry about it -- there could be any number of reasons for the delay, none particularly bothersome
[04:37] <bimberi> jksd: put the contents of /etc/network/interfaces on the pastebin ...
[04:37] <Desh> slavik: how would I open it? It says I do not have permission. :(

[04:37] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, bimberi
[04:37] <cocox> amphi, Managu thank you so much for be so patient with this noob :)
[04:38] <amphi> cocox: yw
[04:38] <jksd> Managu: I also have a 3G card, it could be that
[04:38] <jksd> bimberi: OK
[04:38] <cocox> Managu, amphi i'll read as much as i can
[04:38] <odin_> how do you uninstall stuff again?
[04:38] <Managu> jksd: Sorry, I don't know what a 3G card is
[04:38] <amphi> cocox: the Stevens book is damn good - you might even find a copy knocking about on the web
[04:39] <jksd> Managu: it's a mobile internet card
[04:39] <amphi> cocox: otherwise, tldp.org has lots of goodies; there's an 'intro to linux' book there, which might be of use
[04:40] <Bjorn_> ubotu: latest release
[04:40] <ubotu> Huh? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Bjorn_
[04:40] <Managu> jksd: ok.  That'd have been my guess.  What exactly are you using to get internet access right now?  Dial-up modem?  3G? Local Area Network?
[04:40] <Bjorn_> ubotu: are you an eggplant?
[04:40] <ubotu> parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Bjorn_

[04:40] <cocox> amphi, ok i'll look for all the things that you are suggesting to me thank u buddy
[04:40] <jksd> Managu: broadband
[04:41] <Managu> jksd: and how is the broadband connected to your combuter?
[04:41] <jksd> Managu: and that's the only one that's using DHCP
[04:41] <jksd> Managu: broadband modem
[04:41] <Managu> jksd: you have an internal broadband modem?
[04:41] <jksd> Managu: external
[04:41] <jksd> bimberi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14506
[04:41] <Managu> jksd: how is it connected to your computer?
[04:41] <linux_newbie2> Ubuntu installed successfully!  Yay!
[04:41] <jksd> Managu: ethernet
[04:42] <Managu> jksd: gotcha.
[04:43] <Managu> jksd: I'm back to my previous statement then -- a long delay at bootup isn't necessarily a problem, so long as you eventually get passed it.
[04:43] <jksd> Managu: oh OK
[04:43] <Managu> jksd: it may be that your network card is just a little slow getting started
[04:43] <jksd> Managu: hmm, it's a fast connection though
[04:44] <Managu> jksd: not a relivant fact
[04:44] <cubikdice> Hey guys, how do i find out what linux thinks the amount of MHZ my CPU has?
[04:44] <jksd> Managu: oh I see
[04:44] <slavik> cpuid
[04:44] <tsume> frantic: this is weird
[04:44] <cubikdice> command not found
[04:45] <jksd> Managu: oh you're talking about the actual hardware booting up
[04:45] <Managu> cubikdice: cat /proc/cpuinfo.   or "dmesg | less"
[04:45] <tsume> frantic: I'm able to boot from the hd if I select "boot from hard drive" in the livecd
[04:45] <Managu> jksd: yes
[04:45] <tsume> frantic: its grub, its starting too quick before my hardware has a change to boot properly
[04:45] <frantic> that's weird
[04:45] <tsume> *chance
[04:45] <jksd> Managu: could be I guess, computer is OK though
[04:45] <jksd> Managu: when I say OK, I mean OK standard
[04:46] <Managu> jksd: I know one of my computers has a built-in broadcom-based ethernet port.  And it takes a while to initialize
[04:46] <cubikdice> Managu, WTF it said i only have 1005.107 i have an AMD 64 4000+ 2.4 ghz CPU, is there a way to fix this?
[04:46] <Managu> cubikdice: well, errm, 2 things
[04:46] <jksd> Managu: alright, well thanks for your help anyways
[04:46] <slavik> cubikdice: you probably have cool n quiet enable
[04:46] <cubikdice> oh
[04:46] <slavik> enabled*
[04:46] <cubikdice> yeah
[04:46] <cubikdice> lol
[04:47] <Managu> cubikdice: if you're not running anything processor intensive, you're computer probably has the speed dialed down a bit
[04:47] <cubikdice> i never knew it did that

[04:47] <Yanlowen> Hey does anyone know anything about using wine to run windows apps under linux?
[04:47] <slavik> thens croll down to system and hardware

[04:49] <Yanlowen> managu: reader, my question is do I have to have a dos patition mounted to install it or can I use wine to install it into the linux file system?
[04:49] <cubikdice> brb then
[04:50] <spikeb> Yanlowen: there's a native adobe reader for linux

[04:50] <mynimal> ImportError: No module named gtk
[04:50] <slavik> shangdu: english please
[04:50] <Managu> Yanlowen: if wine supports acrobat reader, you don't need a dos partition.  That said, there are a number of other options
[04:50] <spikeb> shangdu:  #ubuntu-cn  #ubuntu-tw   #ubuntu-hk
[04:50] <mynimal> It happens when I start add/remove, update manager, etc.
[04:50] <babo> ok thanks ...
[04:50] <mynimal> Anyone have any idea?
[04:50] <shangdu> ;(
[04:51] <katie_> is there a way to get the lexmark x74 scanner to work in ubuntu? :(
[04:51] <slavik> mynimal: did you remove gtk or something?
[04:51] <Managu> yanlowen: ubuntu ships with Evince, which can read PDF documents.  There's also a native version of acrobat reader that Adobe offers
[04:51] <mynimal> I'm pretty definite I haven't. I have GTK+ 2.8.17 installed, according to applications that depend on it.
[04:52] <Yanlowen> managu: okay can I install a windows program to run under wine from my native linux drive?
[04:52] <shangdu> 
[04:52] <katie_> it is supported by sane

[04:52] <katie_> it is not supported by sane

[04:55] <XhyldazhK> spikeb: hi, well a friend has stuck packages
[04:55] <slavik> katie_: when you mouse over?
[04:55] <Managu> Yanlowen: you were talking to slavik =p
[04:55] <Yanlowen> managu: unrelated
[04:55] <katie_> slavik: on my desktop
[04:55] <mynimal> I'll just post a topic, too crazy in here.
[04:55] <spikeb> XhyldazhK: has the friend tried dist-upgrade instead of upgrade?
[04:55] <XhyldazhK> slavik: we tried apt-get -f install, we tried dpkg -P those packages
[04:55] <slavik> katie_: without mousing over?
[04:56] <XhyldazhK> yup we tried that too
[04:56] <spikeb> hmm
[04:56] <Managu> Yanlowen: but go ahead and ask your question; I'm sure the channel will be happy to jump in and talk
[04:56] <XhyldazhK> spikeb i have a log of the upgrade in openoffice format
[04:56] <katie_> slavik:  without mouse over it stops playing

[04:57] <NickGarvey> s/saaa/haaa/
[04:57] <katie_> slavik: yes

[04:58] <Yanlowen> thanks for the earlier help managu
[04:58] <NickGarvey> !justask
[04:58] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[04:58] <slavik> ubotu: ask

[04:58] <Pyru> Hello anyone help me out , i installed webmin, an di cant seem to remove it (uninstall it)
[04:58] <Managu> Yanlowen: np
[04:58] <katie_> slavik:  why would xmms be able to and totem not thats weird
[04:58] <cubikdice> slavik, ah much better, thank you
[04:58] <ray_> does anyone know of a reasonably priced video card that works in linux with tv-out
[04:58] <slavik> katie_: can totem play it?
[04:58] <slavik> cubikdice: np :)
[04:59] <slavik> cubikdice: you can thank me by sending me that CPU ;)
[04:59] <Managu> yanlowen: you probably want at least a "Main Menu", and a "window list"
[04:59] <katie_> slavik:  yep totem can
[04:59] <slavik> hmm
[04:59] <cubikdice> slavik, LOL
[04:59] <slavik> cubikdice: I wasn't joking >.<

[05:00] <ray_> my radeon 7200 has an s-video out, but isn't supported by atitvout
[05:00] <cubikdice> muhhahaha
[05:00] <katie_> kubuntu?
[05:00] <Heath> Hey can someone help me?
[05:00] <dunefan> without installing Kubuntu!
[05:00] <katie_> why not install blackbox instead?
[05:00] <linux_newbie2> I've got an hda2 icon on my desktop, but when I click on it, it says "The folder contents could not be displaed.  You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "hda2"."  How do I fix this?
[05:00] <Heath> I need to rebuild my package database how can I do that?
[05:00] <ray_> i was pointed to nvidia, but i don't know which cards with tv-video out are supported in linux
[05:00] <cubikdice> Heath, sudo apt-get update
[05:00] <joe_> Which mp3 player do you guys recommend for Ubuntu?
[05:01] <Managu> yanlowen: oh, I don't know what could be wrong then =(
[05:01] <Heath> Doesn't work cubikdice
[05:01] <jksd> bimberi: oh OK, you look at the pastebin?
[05:01] <Heath> I will try again though
[05:01] <cubikdice> wtf
[05:01] <slavik> joe_: if you want a winamp like thing then xmms
[05:01] <Managu> linux_newbie2: you'll probably have to edit your fstab file for that
[05:01] <deoryp> linux_newbie2 : you have to add yourself to a group maybe>?
[05:01] <madewokherd> dunefan: install kde
[05:01] <madewokherd> er, wait, that was the question
[05:01] <Flannel> ray_: ALL nvidia cards are supported, nvidia releases it's drivers
[05:01] <dsl1919> hi, i'm trying to compile pgadmin and had to apt-get install wx-common, but wx-config still can't be found.  i'm having trouble locating the package that provides this file.  does anyone know?
[05:01] <madewokherd> kde is a package
[05:02] <Yanlowen> managu: I know what I did wrong, I deleted the file appelt for it, can I reload those files without reloading ubuntu totally?
[05:02] <madewokherd> as is kubuntu-desktop
[05:02] <katie_> frozen bubble has no sound :(
[05:02] <ray_> flannel, really? that's great
[05:02] <slavik> teh sux
[05:02] <slavik> imo, the game is too easy
[05:02] <dunefan> couldn;t find package KDE
[05:02] <spikeb> i love frozen bubble
[05:02] <madewokherd> lowercase
[05:02] <ray_> so going the cheapo route on an old computer is okay?
[05:02] <Managu> Yanlowen: it's possible (you'll want to figure out which package those files are in, and force that package to reinstall)
[05:02] <spikeb> ray_: yes
[05:02] <slavik> I like frozen bubble but it's too easy ... 30 levels can be finished easily
[05:02] <joe_> Do I need to install a c-complier and such to install xmms?
[05:03] <Managu> Yanlowen: but to be honest, I don't know which packages you need
[05:03] <katie_> slavik: design ur own
[05:03] <slavik> joe_: no
[05:03] <Managu> joe_: shouldn't

[05:03] <Flannel> ray_: well, better video cards might have better performance.
[05:03] <slavik> Yanlowen: delted as in right click and remove?
[05:03] <ray_> once again, you guys are aweseom
[05:03] <katie_> slavik:  it takes like a sec to click on button :)
[05:03] <ray_> awesome even!
[05:03] <guest_> carla_satur
[05:03] <slavik> or as in went into file system and deleted?

[05:04] <mintee> hey all...
[05:04] <guest_> joined the room
[05:04] <Dr_Willis> Yanlowen:  use the right click button on the panel and use the add to panel.. menu items.
[05:04] <Managu> ray_: I'd _strongly_ suggest a nVidia based card
[05:04] <ray_> flannel, anything is better than an old nvidia tnt2 32mb card :)

[05:04] <Kr0ntab> sup folks
[05:04] <Yanlowen> slavik: I had a load failed and it asked several questions about reloading applet. I pushed delete the file because it failed to load
[05:05] <mintee> i just installed 5.10 on a thinkpad x30 and the framebuffer during boot is very flashy...    during the install the screen was skewed and flashing.  X11 works fine though.  Any ideas?
[05:05] <Heath> Nvidia Drivers
[05:05] <spikeb> Kr0ntab: not much, sup with you
[05:05] <slavik> Managu: I used their installer to generate packages and then dpkg -i *.deb
[05:05] <Kr0ntab> nm
[05:05] <katie_> koules sound doesnt work either
[05:05] <Managu> linux_newbie2: "defaults" --> "umask=000"

[05:05] <cary> joined the room
[05:05] <ray_> go with nvidia because ati doesn't play nice
[05:05] <Ratzilla> has anyone used this WPA guide http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=90450 before successfully/
[05:06] <mintee> well is there a way to turn it off, and just do txt?
[05:06] <slavik> joe_: I would suggest using synaptic (system -> admin -> synaptic)
[05:06] <spikeb> mintee: yes.
[05:06] <spikeb> mintee: i have no idea how
[05:06] <spikeb> heh
[05:06] <mintee> lol, thanks
[05:06] <cary> hi.............
[05:06] <Managu> Heath: I don't know what "cman" is
[05:06] <wfaulk> I was installing ubuntu for the first time today and it would hang every time it tried to apt-get grub.  any ideas?
[05:06] <cary> hello................................
[05:06] <joe_> Ok, thanks
[05:06] <Heath> Managu: If you don't know what it is how the hell can I fix it O.O AHHH
[05:06] <Managu> wfaulk: 5.10? 6.06?
[05:07] <slavik> Managu: agreed
[05:07] <wfaulk> 5.10
[05:07] <Kr0ntab> Ratzilla, those instructions will work... but you don't need to worry about the last step of creating a new init.d symbolic link
[05:07] <Yanlowen> slavik: okay I have tried to use the "add to panel" but the icons for my various desktops and the main desktop button on the left side are not reloading. as if the files was deleted from the hard drive.
[05:07] <Heath> Managu: Am I going to have to reinstall Linux completely?
[05:07] <Yanlowen> slavik: those icon on the gnome panel that is
[05:07] <Kr0ntab> !wpa
[05:07] <ubotu> Enable the universe repository, then "sudo apt-get update", and then "sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant".  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WPAHowto for more details
[05:07] <slavik> Yanlowen: are you right clicking on the panel you want to add stuff to?
[05:07] <Managu> Heath: *shrug* That's probably a bit extreme.  Happen to know what the names of the packages you're trying to install are?
[05:07] <Yanlowen> slavik: yes
[05:07] <Kr0ntab> Ratzilla, see that link for some fairly decent instructions
[05:08] <slavik> Yanlowen: do you double clickw hat you want to add or single click then click "Add"?
[05:08] <Heath> Managu: nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common
[05:08] <cary> hi.....................
[05:08] <slavik> that adds stuff to toolbars, not to desktop
[05:08] <wfaulk> it appears to be a problem with apt-get rather than a problem with grub
[05:08] <cary> hi..................................
[05:08] <Ratzilla> Kr0ntab: i already did it..im just not sure what to do with ubuntu's networking ...the one that has the icon on the taskbar by default
[05:08] <slavik> !patience
[05:08] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
[05:08] <slavik> !ask
[05:08] <Managu> Heath: tried installing from the command line?  e.g. "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common"?
[05:08] <Kr0ntab> Ratzilla, you dont need to do anything with that
[05:08] <cary> helo
[05:08] <dsl1919> the package turned out to be libwxgtk2.6-dev ... one of those ones that has "lib" at the start
[05:09] <Ratzilla> Kr0ntab: so i can have the device inactive?
[05:09] <slavik> !tell cary about ask
[05:09] <Yanlowen> slavik: okay I am going to try and reinstall the packages from the ubuntu cd, thanks for the help
[05:09] <mintee> I've found CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=m but I don't know what else to use other than the 'm'
[05:09] <bimberi> jksd: hmmk, you could try commenting out "auto eth0" in your interfaces file.  it migh work, although i suspect it might be required in order for your PC to connect to your modem at startup
[05:09] <nomin> is there a program that can make dvd movies?
[05:09] <Managu> Heath: If the world is fair, you should get the same error -- but you might get a bit more information to accompany it
[05:09] <Dr_Willis> mintee:  m-odule , y-es or n-o :P
[05:09] <bimberi> *might
[05:09] <Heath>  Managu: E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[05:09] <mintee> Thanks Dr_Willis
[05:09] <linux_newbie2> Is EasyUbuntu safe?
[05:09] <wizzlefish> awww man! The Uncyclopedia says that Ubuntu is gay :(
[05:10] <mintee> i'll say no, reboot and bbiab
[05:10] <spikeb> linux_newbie2: it's pretty safe
[05:10] <Managu> Heath: how bout pastebin'ing the entire error
[05:10] <wizzlefish> that's one thing I haven't agreed on with that fake encyclopedia
[05:10] <cary> hi slavik
[05:10] <Dr_Willis> !easyubuntu
[05:10] <ubotu> I guess easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
[05:10] <slavik> linux_newbie2: it should be, if it isn't a certain dev will get his hands chopped off :)
[05:10] <Heath> Managu: pastebin'ing?
[05:10] <Kr0ntab> it's all about your /etc/network/interfaces file and making sure it is set up correctly.  That icon in the bottom panel is non-important
[05:10] <nomin> I would like to know what program can take videos on a hard drive and put them onto a DVD to be played in a DVD player.
[05:10] <Managu> heath: or even the entire result of the apt-get command
[05:10] <slavik> !tell heath about pastebin

[05:10] <slavik> nomin: I suggest asking doom9.net people ... they would know
[05:11] <bimberi> jksd: easily undone anyway :)
[05:11] <seb_> does anyone have a powerbook g44

[05:12] <bimberi> ubotu tell seb_ about airportextreme
[05:13] <wizzlefish> although the parody release names are hilarious...
[05:13] <Managu> Heath: random thought... read the channel topic when you joined?
=== guest_ is now known as cary
[05:13] <spikeb> they can't possibly be worse than the actual names
[05:13] <bakura82> sorry.  i was interecepted by some odd IM
[05:13] <bakura82> anyway, just got a new laptop
[05:13] <Heath> Managu: What?
[05:13] <bakura82> AMD 64 turion
[05:13] <cary> joined the room
[05:13] <bakura82> hp dv5000 series
[05:13] <spikeb> bakura82: cool
[05:14] <Managu> Heath: The American (US) repositories are not working - please take the us. out of your /etc/apt/sources.list file. Thank you!
[05:14] <linux_newbie2> spikeb: thanks :)
[05:14] <Heath> Managu: How do I do that I'm very new to Linux
[05:14] <spikeb> linux_newbie2: you bet.
[05:14] <Managu> Heath: it won't solve your current problem now, but it might have earlier.  That said --
[05:14] <bakura82> i wanted tryout out the ubuntu distro, but I don't have enough experience to trouble shoot it.  it give me the option to hit enter and install.  well, it hangs... the last thing I see is somethign about "frame buffers..." and it goes to fast for me to catch it
[05:15] <bakura82> any thought?
[05:15] <Managu> Heath: "gtksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"
[05:15] <Heath> Managu: So I can't fix my current problem?
[05:15] <vars> bimberi, are you around
=== guest_ is now known as cary
[05:15] <Managu> heath: make that "gksudo" ...
[05:15] <cary> hi.......................
[05:15] <bimberi> vars: yep
[05:15] <Managu> Hi cary!
[05:16] <vars> cool i need to configure this poert forwaing
[05:16] <cary> hi managu. asl pls
[05:16] <Heath> Managu: Now I delete all teh us.?
[05:16] <katie_> is there a wrapper for scanners?
[05:16] <Ry> So, how bad is the error message "kernal panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,0)"?
[05:16] <Heath> Managu: So it is just i.e. http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
[05:16] <bakura82> how about this.  first question:  I am using an AMD 64.  MUST I install the 64 bit or can I use the i386?
[05:16] <Managu> heath: many of the internet addresses start or have "us." in them.  yeah, you got the idea
[05:16] <slavik> Ry: is this a dual boot system?
[05:16] <Ry> slavik: no
[05:17] <Managu> cary: Sorry, not interested in cyborz today.  There are better places to have a social conversation.
[05:17] <slavik> Ry: only ubuntu is there?
[05:17] <Ry> slavik: yep
[05:17] <Managu> bakura82: you can use the i386
[05:17] <Ry> dedicated ubuntu machine
[05:17] <slavik> ry, then it's weird
[05:17] <Heath> Mangu: Done so now I should be able to install?
[05:17] <Ry> installed from a fresh format.
[05:17] <slavik> ry, I am not the kernel expert :(
[05:17] <Managu> bakura82: in fact, I'd rather suggest it for the present.  Installing 64 bit could be problematic
[05:17] <Ry> :/
[05:17] <bakura82> Managu: that's what I though.  no luck though.
[05:17] <bakura82> Managu:  I agree
[05:17] <cary> k fine
[05:17] <Managu> heath: let's do some cleanup next.  "sudo apt-get update"
[05:18] <slavik> bakura82: openoffice doesn't compile for 64bit and then is other unsupportedness
[05:18] <Heath> I <3 Linux
[05:18] <Heath> Haha
[05:18] <Heath> Managu: Done
[05:18] <Pyru> Hello anyone help me out , i installed webmin, an di cant seem to remove it (uninstall it)
[05:18] <cubikdice> w0rd
[05:18] <slavik> ry, I am guessing that it is not able to mount the root partition
[05:18] <bakura82> slavik: np.  i prefer the 32.  reading the forums right now to try and find my problem
[05:18] <slavik> Pyru: how did you install it?
[05:18] <Managu> heath: after that, let's see if we can get rid of cman.  "sudo dpkg --purge cman"
[05:18] <Ry> yesyes, that seems obvious. The question is why and how to fix it. ;)
[05:19] <Heath> should it be sudo dpkg -P cman?
[05:19] <Pyru> slavik, through synaptic if i remember correclty
[05:19] <Heath> Managu: should it be sudo dpkg -P cman?
[05:19] <slavik> ry, this is why I feel said (I don't know :()
[05:19] <Managu> Heath: it's quite possible that's equivalent
[05:19] <Madpilot> Pyru, selected thru Synaptic again, and select the Uninstall option
[05:19] <slavik> prolly is
[05:19] <vars> hey how do i make a static ip adress
[05:19] <Pyru> slavik, actually I downloaded it to my desktop
[05:19] <Pyru> then untarred then installed
[05:19] <slavik> Pyru: make install?
[05:19] <vars> and what is dyndns
[05:19] <slavik> !dyndns
[05:19] <ubotu> [dyndns]  a free service to provide people with canonical hostnames for their dynamic IP addresses, thus making it easier for their personal systems to be reached when they are online. Please see http://www.dyndns.org/ for more information.
[05:20] <Pyru> slavik, this is my first day on linux
[05:20] <Heath> Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14511
[05:20] <slavik> Pyru: did you do anything in the terminal?
[05:20] <slavik> Pyru: ie: command line
[05:20] <Pyru> yup
[05:20] <Heath> Pyru: My second ;)
[05:20] <slavik> Pyru: did you do "make install" in command line?
[05:20] <bakura82> ACK.  man.
[05:20] <vars> Flannel, what is dyndns   is it a service or an apt?
[05:20] <bakura82> ANyone know how i can
[05:20] <slavik> Pyru: the untarred directory is still there?
[05:20] <bakura82> "pause" the install
[05:20] <Pyru> slackern, yes
[05:20] <Pyru> but If i try to remove it , its in use
[05:20] <bakura82> so I can see what the heck is causing teh hang
[05:21] <Heath> Managu: Did you catch that?
[05:21] <slackern> *snarl*
[05:21] <Flannel> vars: it's a website
[05:21] <Managu> Have I ever mentioned how I hate dpkg?
[05:21] <bakura82> or at least go line by line
[05:21] <Managu> Heath: yes, I caught it
[05:21] <slavik> Pyru: go to the directory in terminal and do "make uninstall"
[05:21] <abarbaccia> hey all - what do i do if i need a module that's included in the 2.6.15 kernel but i'm running breezy and don't want to upgrade it - can you download the source and compile it?
[05:21] <Heath> Managu: Any suggestions?
[05:21] <Managu> Heath: dpkg can be quite annoying if anything gets out of whack
[05:21] <slavik> Managu: go back to rpm you masochistic bitch :P
[05:21] <Managu> slavic: back?  I started on debian =(
[05:21] <Madpilot> slavik, language, thanks
[05:21] <slavik> oh ... then why hate on dpkg?
[05:22] <Pyru> what command is make uninstall?
[05:22] <vars> you had mentioed that i might need that for displaying a website on the net  with my server
[05:22] <slavik> Madpilot: it was for effect ...
[05:22] <Heath> slavik: If you can help then help haha
[05:22] <spikeb> dpkg is insistant on having a perfect install
[05:22] <spikeb> heh
[05:22] <bakura82> Is there a way to have ubuntu install go line-by-line or simply a button that I can use to pause during installation so I can find what's causing my problem?
[05:22] <slavik> Pyru: open a terminal
[05:22] <Managu> slavik: because if something doesn't configure properly, it can be very, very annoying to clean stuff up
[05:22] <Managu> heath: what do you get when you dpkg --pending --configure ?
[05:22] <slavik> Managu: isn't rpm like that, too?
[05:22] <Pyru> slavik, IM IN TERMINAL
[05:22] <slavik> but with the dependency hell "feature"?
[05:22] <Pyru> woops
[05:22] <cary> hi.........................
[05:23] <slavik> Pyru: good :D
[05:23] <Managu> slavik: My hatred could well be universal.  But then, I've never used RPM
[05:23] <spikeb> dpkg by itself has dependency hell, you know.
[05:23] <cary> helo.................................
[05:23] <slavik> go to the untarred directory
[05:23] <Heath> Managu: dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege
[05:23] <katie_> guess ill have to uninstall ubuntu :((
[05:23] <slavik> spikeb: not with apt and synaptic :)
[05:23] <tritium> katie_: why?
[05:23] <Managu> heath righto.  "sudo dpkg --pending --configure"
[05:23] <spikeb> slavik: and the same can be said of rpm and smart or yum :P
[05:23] <katie_> katie_;  wont work with my printer scanner :((
[05:23] <Managu> heath: you might as well prepend "sudo" to everything we say from now on, 'cause none of it can be done without superuse privilege
[05:23] <Heath> Managu: It just goes to the next line
[05:23] <Pyru> slavik, command? lol
[05:23] <tritium> katie_: which models?
[05:23] <slavik> spikeb: I read a terrible thing about yum ... how it hits the server up for anything it does ...
[05:24] <bakura82> anyone?
[05:24] <slavik> Pyru: "make uninstall"
[05:24] <Managu> heath: that's good.  Try removing again.  "dpkg --purge cman"
[05:24] <katie_> tritium:  lexmark x74
[05:24] <raton> does anybody know how to make the right click option on a mac work
[05:24] <spikeb> slackern: yes, it can be irritating
[05:24] <slavik> spikeb: to the point that "yum update" is useless
[05:24] <tritium> katie_: you're sure?
[05:24] <raton> my ctrl button doesnt seem to work
[05:24] <Pyru> ~/Desktop/webmin-1.270$ make uninstall

[05:26] <slavik> katie_: I would suggest hp but I doubt it's an option :(
[05:26] <Madpilot> knanand, install the rar packages thru synaptic
[05:26] <Managu> Heath: It looks like that's stuff for computer clustering; I'd guess the module has something to do with load balancing, but it's just a random guess
[05:26] <vars> please help me
[05:26] <CyberDoo> Question: Is there a way to disable a unmet dependencies warning?
[05:26] <slackern> knanand: you need unrar or unrar-free packages
[05:27] <slavik> CyberDoo: by installing the dependancy :)
[05:27] <Heath> Managu: Any way I can fix that?  Thats what my webmaster samuel said cluster=bad O.o He knows nothing about it
[05:27] <katie_> tritium: nope printer not listed there :(
[05:27] <CyberDoo> slavik: Perhaps a little elaberation......
[05:27] <knanand> Madpilot, what are the packages ???
[05:27] <CyberDoo> slavik: On my part.
[05:27] <tritium> katie_: sorry....

[05:28] <vars> ????
[05:28] <Heath> bakura82: You may have had a burn error
[05:28] <tritium> katie_: sounds like the printer is the problem, not the OS ;)
[05:28] <shawn_home> does metacity have AIGLX support now?
[05:28] <slavik> shawn_home: in dapper I think ...

=== guest__ is now known as noe
[05:29] <bakura82> sparkleytone: ALT-F4 is a no go
[05:29] <Managu> Heath: I dunno, really.  You need to uninstall the package, but dpkg won't let you unless it succeeds in doing something that's currently failing
[05:29] <Heath> bakura82: You have nothing better to do
[05:29] <bakura82> before I burn this again.
[05:29] <CyberDoo> I want to use Ekiga, the gnomemeeting replacement. New libraries are needed todo this. One library is the h323 library. If I remove this, gnomemeeting complains. If I remove gnomemeeting then it wants to remove ubuntudesktop which I don't want to remove. Suggestions?
[05:29] <bakura82> Heath:  actually.  sleep would be better.  llol.
[05:29] <Managu> heath: maybe if we try installing cman, we can get it to work properly
[05:29] <Heath> Managu: Is there anyway to force it to shutdown?
[05:29] <pppoe_dude> say glxgears is working, and cpu is at 5%, if i move the window while the gears are moving, and cpu goes to 100%, does that mean i have no video acceleration?
[05:29] <Managu> heath: try "sudo apt-get install cman"
[05:29] <Heath> bakura82: do what I did sleep while you burn
[05:29] <sparkleytone> bakura82: that console should tell you the error
[05:29] <noe> hi................................
[05:30] <noe> helo.....................................
[05:30] <CyberDoo> noe: Hello.
[05:30] <Heath> Still error
[05:30] <bakura82> sparkleytone:  It scrolls to fast.  I can't stop it or slow it down.
[05:30] <bakura82> That's why I asked how to do a line by line install] 
[05:30] <Heath> Managu: Still get an error i'll pastebin it
[05:30] <bakura82> so i can see the issue
[05:31] <Heath> Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14513
[05:31] <sparkleytone> bakura82: you'll have to drop to the 2nd console and find the apt log and tail -f it
[05:31] <slavik> Pyru: there should be an uninstall script
[05:32] <Managu> Heath: well, it's all guesses from here out.  What's "sudo dpkg --audit" suggest?
[05:32] <katie_> can someone teach me how to reverse engineer a scanner driver?
[05:32] <bakura82> sparkleytone:  I can't (or don't know how-to) change to a different console during teh initial install
[05:32] <Heath> Managu: cman is only half configured and thats my cluster manager
[05:32] <Heath> Managu: That can't be very good
[05:32] <Pyru> slavik, dunno
[05:32] <sparkleytone> bakura82: its alt-f#
[05:32] <Pyru> Im new to linux today is my first day
[05:32] <Pyru> so no clue
[05:32] <sparkleytone> 1 is console 1, 2 is 2, etc
[05:32] <joe_> Can someone tell me what to do if it tells me my c compiler can't create executables? I'm using gcc
[05:33] <Managu> Heath: right, we know that.  What's the audit suggest?
[05:33] <Heath> Managu: Is there a way to force delete it from the process so its not configured at all
[05:33] <DJ_Danni> siminn verk
[05:33] <Heath> Managu: Hang on let me try to do what it says
[05:33] <DJ_Danni> sorry
[05:33] <Managu> heath: that's what I've been trying to accomplish =/
=== rayonp is now known as CaDaVeRiA
[05:33] <bakura82> sparkleytone:  that is what is should be.  i know.  but it doesn't work in teh inistail install for some reason.
[05:33] <CyberDoo> joe_: What do you mean?
[05:33] <bakura82> it's not switchign
[05:33] <hou5ton> I upgraded to Dapper and now it brings up the log in page, ... I log in .. and then I just get a screen with the colored background and nothing else ...
[05:33] <sparkleytone> bakura82: try a diff keyboard
[05:34] <bakura82> .... laptop...   with no PS2 port....
[05:34] <bakura82> and I don't have a USB one
[05:34] <Managu> joe_: make sure "build-essentials" is installed?
[05:34] <Heath> Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14515
[05:34] <abarbaccia> if i have the linux 2.6.15 source and want to compile one module to use in my 2.6.12 kernel - how would i do it?
[05:34] <tritium> Managu: build-essential (no "s")
[05:34] <sparkleytone> bakura82: try using the fn key too
[05:34] <bakura82> good point
[05:35] <Managu> what he said!
[05:35] <sparkleytone> ;)
[05:35] <slavik> Pyru: ./run-uninstalls.pl
[05:35] <bakura82> frell
[05:35] <bakura82> no go
[05:35] <slavik> abarbaccia: firstly, get the 2.6.12 source ...
[05:35] <Heath> Managu: Any suggestions now?
[05:35] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: you would download the 2.6.12 source, make menuconfig...import the config from your current kernel...and then enable said module
[05:36] <joe_> Managu: Thanks, that did it
[05:36] <Managu> Heath: I'm reading the manpage for dpkg.  You might do the same (man dpkg)
[05:36] <slavik> sparkleytone: modules come in patch (diff) form or what?
[05:36] <Pyru> slavik, do I type that in terminal?
[05:36] <Pyru> or double click the icon in the folder
[05:37] <eddiestone> jake, thanks
[05:37] <sakka> looking for help, setting up my wireless card. configuring wpa.
[05:37] <bakura82> So is there no line-by-line command in linux/ubuntu?
[05:37] <sparkleytone> slavik: don't think so...what i was getting at is that if they want a driver they need to enable it in menuconfig but make sure that the kernel is otherwise the same as it is now
[05:37] <tritium> bakura82: what do you mean?
[05:37] <eddiestone> the try,catch feature doesnt look to works well to me in php, does somebody else feels the same?
[05:37] <Heath> Managu: Does this Help:        deinstall
[05:38] <Heath>               The  package  is  selected  for  deinstallation (i.e. we want to
[05:38] <Heath>               remove all files, except configuration files).
[05:38] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: the module i need is only in the 2.6.15 kernel...
[05:38] <Managu> Heath: not really
[05:38] <Heath> Managu: Can I use that somehow to get rid of it Oh thought maybe I'd be able to
[05:38] <bakura82> tritium: I am having issues installing breezy.  unless i can' slow down the install, i can't see what teh last line was during the initialization taht cause the problem
[05:38] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: then you'll need to upgrade your kernel
[05:38] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: there is no way to use that module with the older kernel?
[05:38] <tritium> bakura82: ah, I see
[05:38] <CyberDoo> I want to use Ekiga, the gnomemeeting replacement. New libraries are needed todo this. One library is and upgrade to the h323 library. If I remove this, gnomemeeting complains. If I remove gnomemeeting then it wants to remove ubuntudesktop which I don't want to remove. How can I suppress the unmet dependancy problems?
[05:39] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: you'll need to go to the new source, make menuconfig, then import the old config and enable the new module
[05:39] <abarbaccia> okay - i see what you're saying
[05:39] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: there are ways, but they are unreliable at best
[05:39] <abarbaccia> build the new kernel with my old config
[05:39] <Heath> Managu: what is prerm script?
[05:39] <tritium> CyberDoo: it'll be in dapper.  Hang tight for 8 or 9 days.
[05:39] <bakura82> tritium: no ideas then, huh?  :/
[05:39] <Managu> Heath: well, more radical still.  Do this -- "sudo rm -f /etc/init.d/cman; sudo touch /etc/init.d/cman;"  Then try purging again
[05:39] <abarbaccia> but enable the module...
[05:39] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: also...if its a distro-supplied kernel...cross-versioning modules is probably not enabled
[05:39] <eddiestone> when a function f1 calls another function f2 from inside a try block, and an exception is throwed from f2, the function f1 gets no exception...
[05:39] <Managu> heath: a prerm script is a program that's run to prepare your system for removing that package
[05:39] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: they are the breezy and dapper kernels
[05:40] <CyberDoo> tritium: Okay. I'll do that. No biggee. Thanks.
[05:40] <slavik> sparkleytone: k
[05:40] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: ya...shouldn't cause problems...just make sure that if you currently boot to an initrd image to build a new initrd too
[05:40] <slavik> Pyru: yes
[05:40] <sakka> i can see the router but the connection drops , reconnects then idles then drops
[05:40] <tritium> bakura82: depends on what issues you're having
[05:40] <Pyru> unkown command if i type it in the terminal
[05:40] <Pyru> slavik,
[05:40] <slavik> sakka: wifi?
[05:40] <bakura82> tritium: Hang on install.
[05:40] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: which means yeah they are initrd images...you'll want to install kernel-package
[05:40] <sakka> yes sir?
[05:40] <slavik> Pyru: with ./ in beginning and in the directory of the untarred tar?
[05:40] <bakura82> tritium:  I can't manage to see WHAT the last line was that may have caused the hang.
[05:40] <slavik> sakka: that is one problem ...
[05:40] <Heath> Managu: when I did thos commands it just went to the next line
[05:41] <Managu> heath: then try purging again
[05:41] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: see, i can't just upgrade to dapper because the fglrx module won't load DRM (i think its a bug) but breezy has no problems
[05:41] <bakura82> heath said bad burn, so I am also burning a new disk to see if maybe thats the prblem
[05:41] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: and once you configure the kernel, you'll make-kpkg --initrd binary
[05:41] <tritium> bakura82: can you drop to a console?
[05:41] <slavik> abarbaccia: dri is fixed I believe
[05:41] <Heath> Managu: Whats command for that sorry so much to learn :S
[05:41] <Pyru> slavik, ~/Desktop/webmin-1.270$ /run-uninstall.pl
[05:41] <Pyru> bash: /run-uninstall.pl: No such file or directory
[05:41] <abarbaccia> slavik: as of when?
[05:41] <bakura82> tritium:  i am having problems doing that
[05:41] <slavik> abarbaccia: with latest fglrx
[05:41] <Managu> heath "sudo dpkg --purge cman"
[05:41] <Heath> Managu: ty
[05:41] <slavik> 8.24.8
[05:41] <eddiestone> when a function f1 calls another function f2 from inside a try block, and an exception is throwed from f2, the function f1 gets no exception...  I think this isnt right.. this happens with some of you too?
[05:41] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: follow?
[05:41] <tritium> bakura82: hmm
[05:41] <Managu> heath: with luck, the error message will change a tad
[05:41] <bakura82> tritium:  maybe you can walk me though because ia m an idiot or something
[05:41] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: yes, thank you!
[05:42] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: np...good luck
[05:42] <Heath>  Managu:      deinstall
[05:42] <Heath>               The  package  is  selected  for  deinstallation (i.e. we want to
[05:42] <Heath>               remove all files, except configuration files).
[05:42] <Managu> heath: no pasting to the channel, please
[05:42] <tritium> bakura82: you're not.  I can't right now, sorry.
[05:42] <ray_> okay, i'm back with more video card questions. forgive me...
[05:42] <Heath> Managu: sorry
[05:42] <bakura82> but i tried switching via alt-fx but it doesn't seem to switch
[05:42] <sparkleytone> abarbaccia: if you've never used make-kpkg before, it will create debs in the parent dir
[05:42] <ray_> i've found a Geforce MX4000 64MB DDR AGP 2X/4X Video Card for 22 bucks
[05:42] <slavik> Pyru: there is an 's' at end of run-uninstalls :)
[05:42] <Heath> Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14519
[05:42] <bakura82> tritium:  no prob.  just a newb tyring to getthis thing going with no luck at all
[05:42] <sakka> slavik: Im missing soemthing...
[05:43] <ray_> it's got s-video out
[05:43] <slavik> ray_: grab it ... damn cheap :D
[05:43] <bakura82> never can problems with a linux distro until ubuntu...
[05:43] <bakura82> :/
[05:43] <bakura82> can = had*
[05:43] <abarbaccia> sparkleytone: i have used that before -- i'm gonna see if i can just upgrade to dapper and use that kernel, if not i'll restore my backup and try building the kernel
[05:43] <Pyru> slavik, ~/Desktop/webmin-1.270$ ./run-uninstalls.pl
[05:43] <ray_> the question is... supported by any programs in linux to control the tv out?
[05:43] <Pyru> Undefined subroutine &main::init_config called at ./run-uninstalls.pl line 7.
[05:43] <slavik> sakka: you're missing 1 million USD :P
[05:43] <slavik> hmm
[05:43] <sakka> lol
[05:43] <tritium> bakura82: I'll try to help you later on
[05:43] <Managu> heath: ooh, good, that's not an error!
[05:43] <bakura82> if i see you around, sure.
[05:43] <slavik> sakka: I am missing that, too, btw
[05:43] <sakka> slavik: that bad of a problem, eh?
[05:43] <Heath> Managu: YAY DANCE
[05:44] <Managu> heath: I don't suppose you have any reason to be running cluster management on that computer
[05:44] <Heath> bakura82: did you try that burn?
[05:44] <AngryElf> anyone have a howto/info for proftpd + ubuntu?
[05:44] <Desh2> Hey, I have a user session that is stuck. I did a Lock Session and not the Unlocking will not work even tho I use the same pass I use to logon.
[05:44] <Heath> Managu: I didnt even know I was... Maybe it is from when I uninstalled Windows?
[05:44] <bakura82> heath: it's just about done.  my other PC is SLOW.  *grin*
[05:44] <Heath> bakura82: Make sure your buffer doesnt go down to 0%
[05:44] <bakura82> eh?
[05:44] <sakka> slavik: Ive tried all that I can I think
[05:44] <Managu> heath: ok.  Just to be sure, repeat the purge command
[05:44] <Heath> bakura82: and that you have no other applications running
[05:45] <ray_> slavik: are there any programs in linux that control the s-video out for that card?
[05:45] <bakura82> just trillian (for IRC)...
[05:45] <Managu> heath: if everything is kosher, you should get an error saying that "cman" isn't installed
[05:45] <Heath> Managu: It said it was ignoring request to remove cman which isnt installed
[05:45] <slavik> ray_: no idea ... no nvidia cards here :(
[05:45] <Managu> heath: good, good.
[05:45] <Pyru> slavik, any idea?
[05:45] <slavik> Pyru: I am not sure why there are a bunch of & before subroutine calls
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> I just saw some nvidia tv out tools in synaptic.
[05:45] <ray_> does anyone one else around here know much about s-video out?
[05:45] <Managu> heath: I'd suggest you go back to following whatever howto or link you were following before to install the nvidia drivers
[05:45] <Heath> Managu: Does that mean I should be able to install now?
[05:46] <slavik> Dr_Willis: anything to better manage ati cards for s-video and second monitor?
[05:46] <bakura82> Heath:  Hear goes CD number 2.  :)
[05:46] <slavik> without having to restart x?
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> slavik,  you dont want to know what i do with ati cards. :P
[05:46] <Managu> heath: that painful exchange should have fixed your main problems
[05:46] <spikeb> haha willis
[05:46] <Heath> bakura82: do you have msn so you can tell me how it goes?
[05:46] <slavik> Dr_Willis: you're right ;)
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> slavik,  but i think ive seen some ati tools also in there.
[05:46] <Heath> Managu: A million thanks to you
[05:46] <Pyru> hmmm I wonder.
[05:46] <amphi> slavik: atitvout ?
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> slavik,  heh -- bbl gotta restartx to test nvidia
[05:46] <bakura82> frell
[05:46] <bakura82> freaking frell
[05:46] <bakura82> it does the same.  that's how it goes.
[05:46] <slavik> amphi: I dunno :P
[05:46] <ray_> willis, let's not get started on atitvout :)
[05:46] <Pyru> slavik, any other idea on how to uninstall this webmin package.
[05:47] <sakka> well if i had the million, not sure if I'd give it all up for help...
[05:47] <bakura82> Heath:  I don't believe it's the CD.  This is something to do with my new PC.
[05:47] <Heath> bakura82: sorry it didnt help its just that what I had to do thought it might work for you
[05:47] <slavik> Pyru: I would see what happens when you install it from the repositories and then uninstall it
[05:47] <ray_> i killed my display three times following a tutorial before i realized my card was not supported
[05:47] <amphi> ray_: haha
[05:47] <slavik> ray_: what card?
[05:47] <bakura82> Heath:  Np.  You can just send ten cents to my paypal account because you just bought another copy of breezy.  ;)
[05:47] <ray_> radeon 7200
[05:48] <slavik> oh
[05:48] <eddiestone> pay meu pau
[05:48] <Heath> Managu: YAY NO ERROR THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
[05:48] <Desh2> I have a session stuck in the lock session. My login pass doesn't work.
[05:48] <Heath> bakura82: You really want me to haha  will
[05:48] <Pyru> slavik, so from synaptic search for webmin then mark it for installation?
[05:48] <slavik> hmm, is there a way to disable downloads in firefox?
[05:48] <Heath> bakura82: I will lol
[05:48] <bakura82> Okay, so back to my first question.
[05:48] <slavik> Pyru: yup
[05:48] <eddiestone> seus viados filhos da puta
[05:48] <slavik> ie: makes firefox not download anything
[05:48] <ray_> i had an older tnt2 that died and had a computer admin friend give me the 7200 for free
[05:48] <amphi> !tell eddiestone about br
[05:48] <Heath> Thank you everyone for you rhelp I'm out ciao
[05:49] <bakura82> QUESTION:  Is there a line-by-line command in linux/ubuntu so I can see the installtion step by tspe?
[05:49] <bakura82> step*
[05:49] <bakura82> Heath:" later
[05:49] <eddiestone> amphi, :)
[05:49] <Managu> bakura: the installation?  The startup?
[05:49] <Desh2> I have a session stuck in the lock session. My login pass doesn't work.
[05:49] <bakura82> installation
[05:49] <ray_> the 7200 had s-video out capabilities
[05:49] <sakka> Is there anything I should check to see if I setup the wifi correctly?
[05:49] <ray_> now, i really want a card with s-video out so i can hook it up to the tv
[05:50] <Pyru> slavik,  then i try an apt-get uninstall blah? or apt-get remove blah
[05:50] <bmlou> Totem player says "No decoders found to handle the stream" Help
[05:50] <Managu> bakura: the quick answer is "no".  The more complicated answer is that you might be able to dig into the installer and figure it out -- but it'll probably require delving into the source
[05:50] <Managu> !tell bmlou about restricted-formats
[05:50] <Managu> !tell bmlou about restricted
[05:50] <samuel_> Ubuntu rawks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[05:50] <ray_> seems like it would be more fun watching old episodes of Lost that way :)
[05:50] <amphi> eddiestone: more will appreciate your sentiment in there ;)
[05:50] <samuel_> what is the command to install kde under ubuntu?
[05:50] <samuel_> please.
[05:51] <slavik> Pyru: or through synaptic :P
[05:51] <eddiestone> samuel_, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[05:51] <samuel_> thanks
[05:51] <bakura82> *sighs*  I guess the Ubuntu distro was just not for me.  Anyone suggest any other distros?  I have usually always used RedHat/Fedora but I wanted to just try something different
[05:51] <amphi> bakura82: debian
[05:51] <bmlou> Restricted Format ??
[05:51] <Managu> bakura82: Linux From Scratch
[05:51] <ray_> go for mepis
[05:52] <don> hey
[05:52] <ChangerOfSea> hey.. i got a question.. how do i install grub from an ubuntu breezy install disc (or would a live disc be better)
[05:52] <amphi> bakura82: or slack... or netbsd ;)
[05:52] <h3h_timo> how do you uninstall mostly all kde packages???
[05:52] <rob> bakura82, you want to see the installation step by step?
[05:52] <|Sivik|> is anyone having problems with breezy freezing or having ff or kopete or xchat closing randomly
[05:52] <rob> bakura82, just do an expert install
[05:52] <don> question about frostwire
[05:52] <bakura82> rob: yes.
[05:52] <don> it wont install
[05:52] <sakka> or should I just give up on trying to set it up?
=== Managu is now known as Managu_away
[05:52] <samuel_> is there any other sites similar to gnome look.org?
[05:52] <DBO> art.gnome.org
[05:52] <slavik> kde look
[05:53] <bakura82> rob: i get the same hang in expert mode unfortunately
[05:53] <amphi> sakka: what card?
[05:53] <bakura82> and i can't even see what is causing it
[05:53] <bmlou> No audio from web pages Help!
[05:53] <rob> bakura82, have you searched Malone, filed a bug?
[05:53] <jbeagley> hey
[05:53] <jbeagley> how can i restart my sound without rebooting?
[05:53] <rob> bakura82, have you tried Dapper, using the live cd installer?
[05:54] <sakka> amphi: Broadcom BCM4306
[05:54] <DBO> jbeagley, using /etc/init.d/alsa restart
[05:54] <bakura82> rob: well, dapper is beta right?  i wanted try what supposedly works
[05:54] <h3h_timo> i hate to ask questions twice... but does anyone know a simple command to remove kde and everything that it includes
[05:54] <ChangerOfSea> how do i install grub from an ubuntu breezy install disc (or would a live disc be better)
[05:54] <rob> bakura82, Dapper pretty muchs works fine
[05:54] <bakura82> rob: as or malone, well, i just had to google what the heck that was.  so, no, i haven't search it.  looking now.
[05:54] <bakura82> rob: well, maybe i will try dapper....
[05:54] <pvd2006> whats the command to change to metacity?
[05:55] <jbeagley> DBO: it says that 'restart' is deprecated
[05:55] <dli> h3h_timo, try, sudo apt-get -f remove "kdelibs*"
[05:55] <rob> bakura82, the live cd installer is very nice (needs some polish)
[05:55] <pvd2006> I remember it being a gconf command
[05:55] <amphi> sakka: sorry, no idea about that
[05:55] <sakka> amphi: np, but thank you very much
[05:56] <h3h_timo> dli, thanks
[05:56] <bakura82> yeah.  okay.  well, bed time for me.  i will dnload dapper tonight and see how that goes later.
[05:56] <rob> sounds good
[05:56] <dli> sakka, bcm43xx is in kernel 2.6.17
[05:56] <bakura82> thanks to all those who tried to help.  maybe someday i will manage to get ubuntu on my system.
[05:56] <DBO> jbeagley, oh right, alsa is bassed to hotplug now... erm, no idea how to do it that way
[05:57] <jbeagley> it said try alsa-utils initscript, which i just tried
[05:58] <bakura82> it's flight seven the latest RC?
[05:58] <bakura82> never seen that nomenclature ... "flight 7"
[05:58] <AngryElf> guys, why is nfs-kernel-server constantly "talking" to the clients?  tcpdump is showing lots of activity when no files are being moved around -- is this normal?

[06:26] <Sivik> whats the password for the ubuntu live cd
[06:26] <anjin_> lastnode: Thanks, I'll give that a shot.
[06:26] <sakka> amphi: well thanks anyway sir
[06:26] <Madpilot> Sivik, there isn't one; it shouldn't ever ask for a pw
[06:26] <lecaroscisterna> any idea? anybody ...
[06:27] <Sivik> Madpilot, ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ fsck /dev/sda4
[06:27] <Sivik> fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
[06:27] <Sivik> e2fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
[06:27] <Sivik> fsck.ext2: Permission denied while trying to open /dev/sda4
[06:27] <Sivik> You must have r/w access to the filesystem or be root
[06:27] <Sivik> and then when i try to log into root, it asks for a password
[06:27] <lastnode> Sivik: sudo -s, and your user passwd
[06:27] <Madpilot> Sivik, first, don't paste like that - second, try sticking sudo in front of that fsck command
[06:27] <disinterseted_pe> i cant use `mark' as a command on breezy
[06:27] <Sivik> lastnode, live cd
[06:27] <sakka> sudo -i?
[06:27] <amphi> sakka: do you see anything in thelogs when the connection drops?
[06:27] <disinterseted_pe> why not?
[06:27] <Sivik> fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
[06:28] <Sivik> thats the output when i run it
[06:28] <sakka> amphi: not sure, im fairly new to linux and not sure what logs to cat
[06:28] <Madpilot> Sivik, Ubuntu uses sudo & your user pw - on the livecd, just use sudo
[06:28] <Pip> hello
[06:28] <Sivik> there it goes, it was asking for a password earlier but this time it didn't
[06:28] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell Sivik about sudo
[06:28] <Sivik> Madpilot, i know what sudo is
[06:29] <DJ_Danni> Hey common this is my first time with a Radio Server on a Ubuntu and you noat wana send me a Private messages... What servesise is that::
[06:29] <slackern> sakka: 'sudo -i' will give you a root prompt to work from
[06:29] <whitesuit> hi, do you guys know any flv player for ubuntu?
[06:29] <Sivik> Madpilot, i was just trying to figure out how to get into sudo in a live cd since it was asking me for a password
[06:29] <sakka> slackern: correct , sorry about that
[06:29] <Madpilot> Sivik, OK - have a look at the URL the bot just sent you, if you haven't read it already
[06:29] <lastnode> ubotu: tell whitesuit about flash
[06:29] <lecaroscisterna> bye guys
[06:29] <Sivik> Madpilot, i also just said that it didn't ask for a password this time that i used it
[06:30] <metatag> where can i download the latest version of linux ?
[06:30] <vars> hey how do i figure out what my gateway ip adress is?
[06:30] <Madpilot> Sivik, using sudo or not?
[06:30] <Sivik> Madpilot, i typed sudo su and it didn't ask for a password that time
[06:30] <dli> metatag, download what?
[06:30] <amphi> sakka: you could tail -f /var/log/syslog and see if you see anything
[06:30] <Madpilot> Sivik, ah, OK
[06:30] <Kyral> metatag: you mean the Kernel?
[06:30] <cam> hi, im testing out ubuntu, the only thing i dislike is this middle resize button ... i tried to find out in the faq if i can change it to the left button but didn't find ... any links ?

[06:31] <Kyral> dli: let him choose from other distros
[06:31] <Kyral> Ubuntu is one "flavor" of Linux
[06:31] <Madpilot> metatag, http://www.ubuntu.com/download

[06:32] <metatag> Kyral, which one shoul i use?
[06:32] <DJ_Danni> Icelandic
[06:32] <Kyral> Madpilot: I am trying to make the distinction that Ubuntu != Linux (in its entirety)
[06:32] <DJ_Danni> Yours
[06:32] <DJ_Danni> ?
[06:32] <Madpilot> Kyral, sure, but he's in #ubuntu ;)
[06:32] <Kyral> metatag: here comes the oddest part about Open Source
[06:32] <anjin_> DIdn't work :(
[06:32] <DJ_Danni> ?
[06:32] <Kyral> metatag: they are all a different spin on the same idea :P
[06:32] <DJ_Danni> Mine is Icelandic
[06:32] <amphi> DJ_Danni: what is your default language?
[06:32] <amphi> oh
[06:33] <Kyral> metatag: Ubuntu is good for beginners such as yourself
[06:33] <anjin_> K3b still won't let me burn.
[06:33] <DJ_Danni> On my Ubuntu its English but usafuly its icelandic
[06:33] <metatag> Kyral, ok thanks... ubuntu is the beginners linux if i understand well
[06:33] <Kyral> but as you learn you may want something more "advanced" that lets you play more with the system (Like Debian, Arch, or Gentoo)
[06:33] <slackern> hehe "what is your default language?" that just have to come from a computer user :)
[06:33] <DJ_Danni> But thats wuy i need help
[06:33] <amphi> slackern: ;)
[06:33] <disinterseted_pe> madpilot my streaming is working on one station lol no others
[06:33] <Kyral> metatag: Others that are good for beginners include Fedora, SuSE, and MEPIS
[06:34] <lwizardl> can a totally headless server be installed of ubuntu ? like using ssh
[06:34] <Madpilot> metatag, Ubuntu works for beginners and experts both
[06:34] <sakka> amphi: i checked out the syslog and nothing is listed about eth1
[06:34] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  ya proberly need a monitor/keyboard to do the install.. but then can unplug them
[06:34] <metatag> Kyral, thanks am going to buy an ubuntu dvd.. how much is the license?
[06:34] <Kyral> metatag: free
[06:34] <Kyral> metatag: GNU General Public License
[06:34] <DJ_Danni> Madpilot or amphi heeeeeelp >NOW to Othere Computer in the same hose
[06:34] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  also i had issues with no monitor/keyboard - if the hard drives got messed - and neeede to be fsck'ed at boot.
[06:34] <dli> lwizardl, if you can make it to boot network, or have a running linux
[06:35] <lwizardl> Dr_Willis, yeah thats what I have been doing i'm just looking to do it all via ssh
[06:35] <metatag> Kyral, GNU ? u mean i get the dvd for free?
[06:35] <UNH2LY> hey everyone
[06:35] <DJ_Danni> Private help
[06:35] <disinterseted_pe> can anyone tell me why the volume up and down doesnt work from my keyboard?
[06:35] <Kyral> metatag: well, you need to buy the blank DVD to burn the ISO onto....
[06:35] <Madpilot> metatag, Ubuntu will ship you a CD (or a bunch) for free, or you can download the CD image (the ISO)
[06:35] <rob> disinterseted_pe, you probably need to configure the key mapping
[06:35] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  if ya have a pwoer failure.. ya box may not boot all the way to ssh. :( that was my prob last week when i had a power outage.. had to plug in a monitor/keyboard to see what was going on
[06:35] <Kyral> Madpilot: I think this concept is completely alien to metatag :P
[06:35] <amphi> DJ_Danni: dpkg-reconfigure locales perhaps
[06:36] <jbeagley> my sound card still won't work
[06:36] <disinterseted_pe> the bar moves but the sound doesnt go up and down
[06:36] <st3v3dnd> Anyone know around when Dapper will be released officially?
[06:36] <Kyral> June 1st
[06:36] <Kyral> I think
[06:36] <Madpilot> Kyral, everyone has to start somewhere ;)
[06:36] <Madpilot> !dapper
[06:36] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[06:36] <Sivik> how do i check my system and cpu temp in ubuntu
[06:36] <metatag> Madpilot, shipping is free?? is it worthwhile if its free?
[06:36] <anjin_> Can anyone help me get K3b to work properly?  When I try to burn, I get "CDrecord has no permission to open this device".  I tried adding my account to the cdrom group... but that didn't work.  Any suggestions?  The default burning software in Ubuntu doesn't do everything I need it to :(
[06:36] <dli> Dr_Willis, try reiser4 , which is more robust with power failure or other kernel crashes
[06:36] <Kyral> metatag: yes
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> Sivik,  install 'lm-sensors'
[06:36] <st3v3dnd> Thanks guys
[06:36] <Madpilot> metatag, absolutely.
[06:36] <Madpilot> metatag, shipit.ubuntu.com for free CDs
[06:36] <Kyral> metatag: Free != Low Quality
[06:36] <Sivik> Dr_Willis, so there isn't something on the live cd?
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> dli,  from what i hear about reiser4 - i plan on avoiding it.
[06:36] <disinterseted_pe> rob did u have that issue?
[06:36] <DJ_Danni> Hey i am noat good in PHP or HTML so HHHHHEEELLP with Username>Domain>Pass
[06:37] <Sivik> has anyone been having problems with ubuntu freezing
[06:37] <DJ_Danni> In Network Servises
[06:37] <rob> disinterseted_pe, yes, I also wanted other multimedia keys working too
[06:37] <lwizardl> Dr_Willis, yeah its just I install ubuntu on alot of pcs and only have 2 monitors/keyboards/mice and kinda would like to find a way to do the installs without always changing cords etc
[06:37] <metatag> ok thanks Madpilot .. thanks Kyral ...
[06:37] <jbeagley> i looked at dmesg and find this relating to my sound card, among other things, "[4294731.406000]  Vortex: init.... <6>done.

[06:37] <amphi> !tell jbeagley about pastebin
[06:37] <disinterseted_pe> ok how do i get it to function properly?
[06:37] <jbeagley> pastebin?
[06:37] <ramza3__> can someone check a site for me
[06:37] <Kyral> metatag: Just the opposite. Because the individual peices of software are written by people who love what they are doing, the quality is higher. Its not their paycheck on the line, rather their pride and reputation as coders that is on the line :D
[06:37] <jmoncayo> dli, what is reiser4?
[06:37] <rob> disinterseted_pe, you need to assign a command to the key
[06:38] <ramza3__> is this available: http://www.crazyontap.com/
[06:38] <disinterseted_pe> ok how where
[06:38] <dli> jmoncayo, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reiser4
[06:38] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  dapper has some sort of OEM intall feature.. but no idea on the details.
[06:38] <rob> disinterseted_pe, try http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=27039
[06:38] <metatag> Kyral, oic... i want to try it out... am worried about viruses that can corrupt my emails
[06:39] <Kyral> metatag: Virii don't exist on Linux
[06:39] <smog> How would I find out my LAN ip address for my ubuntu machine?
[06:39] <UNH2LY> anyone know anything about video drivers and such?
[06:39] <disinterseted_pe> ok ty
[06:39] <Madpilot> metatag, there are basically no Linux viruses
[06:39] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  or do the first install.. then backup with mondo/mindi and use the mindi restore cd to restore the backups to the new machines.
[06:39] <anjin_> Can anyone help me get K3b to work properly?  When I try to burn, I get "CDrecord has no permission to open this device".  I tried adding my account to the cdrom group... but that didn't work.  Any suggestions?  The default burning software in Ubuntu doesn't do everything I need it to :(

[06:39] <Madpilot> metatag, there's Evolution
[06:39] <Dr_Willis> lwizardl,  heh - ive been consoldating my pc's getting rid of the old ones. :P
[06:39] <Kyral> metatag: or Kontact :D
[06:39] <sakka> can i have my wired and wireless running at the same time, or will the router not give the wifi an address?

[06:40] <amphi> ramza3__: it resolves (to web20.assortedinternet.com) but no response
[06:40] <dli> sakka, not a good idea
[06:40] <ramza3__> amphi, thanks
[06:40] <metatag> any idea how long it would take to download?
[06:40] <Kyral> metatag: the great part about Open Source is that you will find at least 10 apps for each task :D If you don't like app A, then try app B, then so on and so forth
[06:40] <dli> sakka, if they are from the same subnet
[06:40] <lwizardl> Dr_Willis, well I have 2 servers, one Ubuntu MythTV box, my desktop. and the 2 mobile laptops
[06:40] <metatag> Kyral, oic

[06:41] <Sivik> how do you test for errors on the hd other than fsck
[06:41] <Kyral> metatag: its the entire base OS....
[06:41] <UNH2LY> smog, you get it?
[06:41] <Madpilot> metatag, it's an entire operating system - a whole CD full
[06:41] <DJ_Danni> NOW
[06:41] <UNH2LY> anyone know anything about video drivers and such?
[06:42] <DJ_Danni> HEELP

[06:42] <UNH2LY> this might be a rather in depth problem if youre willing to stick with me
[06:42] <sakka> is there a command to just watch my wifi connection errors?
[06:43] <dli> DJ_Danni, don't repeat :( this is an english channel anyway
[06:43] <Madpilot> Kyral, welcome to #ubuntu-evangelism ;)
[06:43] <amphi> UNH2LY: lspci should give you an idea what it is
[06:43] <DJ_Danni> So i need help and i am angry
[06:43] <DanTheMan25> so with windows you need to like defrag and stuff and clean out temp files.....do i need to do that with ubuntu?
[06:43] <DJ_Danni> UUURRRR
[06:43] <Kyral> Madpilot: Its more like Open Source evengelism :P
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> DJ_Danni,  so what language do you speak?
[06:43] <jmoncayo> dli, when you should use reiserFS?? is it commonly used?
[06:43] <Madpilot> DanTheMan25, not really
[06:43] <DJ_Danni> Icelandic
[06:43] <UNH2LY> sakka, watch iwlist [connection]  scan
[06:43] <DJ_Danni> Littelbite Emnglish
[06:43] <DJ_Danni> Mean English
[06:44] <DBO> !is
[06:44] <ubotu> I guess is is the country code for iceland
[06:44] <DanTheMan25> Madpilot is that because of the filesystem differences?
=== eno is now known as eno-away
[06:44] <UNH2LY> amphi, lemme check
[06:44] <Madpilot> DJ_Danni, any other languages you speak better than English?
[06:44] <[NP] Tangent> hey guys
[06:44] <dli> jmoncayo, no, avoid reiserfs, #debian people explain that reiserfs is like a rocket, it runs fast, before it explodes

[06:44] <anjin_> Ok then.. are there any other cd/dvd burning packages other than K3b that I can try?  I need something that will recognize and burn various image types, as well as write VIDEO_TS dvd folders, etc... I can't get K3b to work and nobody here seems willing to help :(
[06:44] <Madpilot> DanTheMan25, ext3 doesn't fragment like NTFS or fat32 does
[06:44] <[NP] Tangent> any ideas as to why a certain program (LMMS) will not read the contents of directories?
[06:44] <Kyral> anjin_: Gnomebaker, Graveman come to mind
[06:44] <Dr_Willis> anjin_,  odd that you are having k3b issues - it works great for me.
[06:44] <DJ_Danni> I speak 100% Icelandic but 30-50%English
[06:44] <Ahmuck> anjin_: K3B is your best
[06:44] <DanTheMan25> madpilot thanks :)
[06:44] <Kyral> anjin_: may want to ask in #kde about K3B
[06:44] <DJ_Danni> Some words i do noat undestand
[06:45] <jmoncayo> dli, so the common is to use ext3
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> Hmm.. i cant say that i have used k3b to make a video-dvd however.
[06:45] <Kyral> JFS is teh sexy :D
[06:45] <dli> jmoncayo, so avoid reiserfs, if you are not happy with ext3, try jfs, if have a UPS, try xfs
[06:45] <anjin_> I agree K3b is the best.. I have it working on another machine.  I dont know why it wont on this one.  I tried Gnomebaker, but it didn't recognize a lot of the disc image files I threw at it
[06:45] <DJ_Danni> But one question
[06:45] <DJ_Danni> Wuy do you have this IRC if you noat use this PRIVATE????
[06:45] <Dr_Willis> anjin_,  run it from a terminal and see if any error messages are being printed.
[06:45] <dli> anjin_, what about nautilus-cd-burner ?
[06:46] <Madpilot> DJ_Danni, people get better help in a public channel, usually.
[06:46] <anjin_> dli: Is that the one that pops up automatically when a blank is inserted?  If so... I can only burn data cd/dvds with that
[06:46] <anjin_> Dr_Willis - Should I use sudo k3b?
[06:46] <dli> anjin_, I think so
[06:47] <dli> anjin_, but not sure about whether it's data only
[06:47] <DBO> anjin_, k3b does not require root access
[06:47] <Dr_Willis> ive never had to sudo k3b and i use it ALL the time.. may need to sudo it - and rerun the k3b config tool.
[06:47] <dli> anjin_, double check, " id anjin " to make sure you are within the cdrom group
[06:47] <anjin_> DB0 - Maybe not, but it tells me that Cdrecord does not have permission to the device
[06:47] <Sivik> how do i tell if a live cd is using swap or RAM
[06:47] <DJ_Danni> Iff i can noat get help here wher?? Iff noat here i am gonna swicth frome Ubunto to othere but Ubunto is best for the bigenners my Frend say to me :
[06:48] <DanTheMan25> ;
[06:48] <DBO> anjin_, thats a permission issue that should be resolved, but not by running k3b as root...
[06:48] <dli> Sivik, if you know your swap partition, you can , " sudo swapon /dev/blahblah "
[06:48] <Madpilot> DJ_Danni, are there any Linux groups or clubs in Iceland?
[06:48] <dli> Sivik, don't make mistake with the /dev/ part
[06:48] <amphi> heh
[06:49] <DJ_Danni> No
[06:49] <DJ_Danni> Thats EWuy i came here
[06:49] <anjin_> dli - I dont see cdrom from the id <username> command .. but I added myself to the cdrom group in the gui "Users and Groups"

[07:32] <h6w> This is a new 5.10 ubuntu-powerpc install.
[07:32] <nanotube> h6w, hmm, seems like something you should google for. :)
[07:32] <dli> sakka, is the signal too weak?
[07:32] <mozi> tritium, ok thanks guys
[07:32] <ubuntu> amphi; been running abb 5-10 server for 6 months no probs but server 6.06 on anther partirtion no probs boot back into server bb 5 10 AND  , -kernel panic  - not syncing - I/O error reading memory image -
[07:32] <h6w> Yes, did that, that's why I'm here because I didn't find anything.
[07:32] <fogos> hi... how i can restart de alsa?
[07:32] <amphi> ubuntu: bb?
[07:33] <nanotube> h6w, ah hehe ic... what's the exact error message you get?
[07:33] <dli> mozi, try kopete
[07:33] <ubuntu> brezey badger
[07:33] <rredd4> sudo alsaconf
[07:33] <h6w> As above..
[07:33] <sakka> dli: 100%
[07:33] <ubuntu> amphi: breazy badger
[07:33] <amphi> ubuntu: oh - what memory image, initrd?
[07:33] <dli> mozi, or ekiga
[07:33] <h6w> I just copied and pasted it into the IRC channel. :-)
[07:33] <sakka> dli: im 2 foot away atm
[07:33] <ubuntu> amhi: does not say but i expect so
[07:34] <dli> sakka, can you try another channel at the router, the channel might be too crowded
[07:34] <h6w> It works with sftp but not with ftp.
[07:34] <monkey__> When trying to play a dvd in totem, I'm getting an error message saying "Could not determine type of stream." Totem 1.2.0 using GStreamer 0.8.11. Default BB install.
[07:34] <amphi> ubuntu: you could boot off a cd, chroot into your / and reinstall the kernel package or otherwise fix the initrd
[07:35] <ubuntu> amphi; i am in a live cd now
[07:35] <sakka> dli: i sure can, and have tried 1-11, doesnt seems to matter
[07:35] <Kane> dli: please read your pm
[07:35] <sakka> amphi: posted and thank you for checking it
[07:35] <h6w> Is there a "gnome-ftp-support" package I install or something?
[07:36] <rredd4> with Ubuntu, my synaptics touchpad was auto config'd!!  When I was using debian, sarge, I had to config it...  Sarge is behind the times, Ubuntu rocks!!!!!!!!!!
[07:36] <anjin_> I was able to burn in k3b after running a chmod a+rwx on the actual device in the /dev/ folder
[07:36] <ubuntu> amphi: reinstall the kernel its that major and fix the initrd would be major also
[07:36] <dli> sakka, maybe something wrong with your router
[07:37] <sakka> dli: im showing 2 cells when i run iwconfig eth1 scanning
[07:37] <dli> sakka, do you mean 2 APs?
[07:37] <NiLz> how come the clock is always offsync in ubuntu
[07:37] <NiLz> i have to sync it manually every 2nd day
[07:37] <anjin_> Just in case that info can actually help somebody with the same problem in the future :)
[07:37] <NiLz> and the offset is 2 mins or smth ;)
[07:38] <dli> sakka, you can use iwconfig to set essid and address ( MAC, might be different from iwlist scan)
[07:38] <sakka> dli: sorry about that, I meant iwlist, not iwconfig
[07:39] <ubuntu> amphi: i do not suppose moving grub back to 5-10 server instead of grub as it is now on 6.06 server would make a diffrence?
[07:39] <sakka> dli: yes sir, i have the essid set and the address
[07:39] <paradizelost> hey all, come to #ubuntu-offtopic to discuss this.
[07:39] <paradizelost> http://go.fark.com/cgi/fark/go.pl?IDLink=2079310&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesmokinggun.com%2Farchive%2F.%2F0519063nc1.html
[07:39] <dli> sakka, check your router logs
[07:40] <sakka> dli: ill check them right now
[07:40] <dli> sakka, set static IP at your router also
[07:40] <sakka> dli: roger
[07:40] <anjin_> Anyone able to get a USB wacom tablet working with pressure sensitivity under Ubuntu?  My stylus movements are recognized (albeit poorly), but touching it to the tablet does nothing at all.
[07:40] <sakka> dli: should i see the 2 cells though, or?
[07:40] <dli> sakka, hold on, is it a wireless problem, or your ISP problem
[07:40] <Madpilot> paradizelost, once in -offtopic was enough - that didn't need to arrive here too...
[07:41] <dli> sakka, plugin the nic cable, maybe it also happens with wired
[07:41] <sakka> dli: wireless
[07:41] <I_Love_DRM> Can someone please help me with this error /dev/null Device full
[07:41] <sakka> dli: im wired right now
[07:41] <dli> sakka, it doesn't happen with wired?
[07:41] <wbmj> quit
[07:41] <nanotube> I_Love_DRM, hah
[07:41] <anjin_> Guess not... ohwell.  Later then I guess
[07:42] <sakka> dli: the wifi connect and then drops, im sorry all, but how do i get to pastebin again?
[07:42] <dli> sakka, pastebin.com
[07:43] <dust> so i'm at the final stage for setting up my nvidia twinview but i have one last detail-- the BusId: does anyone know how to set it or a page that gives details?
[07:43] <ubuntu> whats the comand to repair disk is efsk?
[07:43] <h6w> fsck
[07:43] <ubuntu> fsck ok thanks
[07:43] <nanotube> Ubugtu, for ext2 and ext3 filesystems, its e2fsck
[07:43] <dli> ubuntu, fsck is the general, e2fsck is for ext2
[07:43] <ubuntu> and ext3
[07:44] <rredd4> dli is sakka using ndiswrapper?
[07:44] <dli> rredd4, could be, I have no experience with it then :)
[07:44] <sakka> dli: i doesnt happen with wired and i have pasted at pastebin
[07:45] <sakka> rredd4: no sir i am not
[07:45] <matheus> hello
[07:45] <matheus> who knows about a program that load any app in the notification area?
[07:46] <sakka> I used https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Broadcom43xx
[07:46] <rredd4> sakka do you have a linux driver for your wireless card or is it a windows driver from a cd or a web site?
[07:46] <Thlayli> hi
[07:46] <DBO> hi
[07:46] <Thlayli> anyone here?
[07:46] <DBO> lots of us
[07:46] <Thlayli> i just read the the ubuntu website
[07:46] <nanotube> Thlayli, about 700 people :)
[07:46] <Thlayli> i'm wondering whether i should try it
[07:46] <Thlayli> i've been using freebsd for years now
[07:46] <Thlayli> as a workstation
[07:47] <DBO> Thlayli, yeah, go for it man.  If you have problems come back here and we will help you solve them =)
[07:47] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, if you are happy with freebsd, why switch?
[07:47] <sakka> rredd4: i think im using a linux driver?
[07:47] <Madpilot> Thlayli, you're going to get a biased answer here - this is #ubuntu, after all ;)
[07:47] <Thlayli> Well, there are some issues
[07:47] <Thlayli> e.g. the java support
[07:47] <Thlayli> support for macromedia flash
[07:47] <nanotube> Thlayli, unless freebsd is lacking some features/capabilities that you want, no reason to do other os
[07:47] <Thlayli> i'm limited with multimedia things
[07:47] <dust> c'mon someone must know something about BusID. a room full o' smart fellas (gender neutral) like ya'll
[07:47] <matheus> anyone know a program to load apps in notification area???
[07:47] <DBO> Thlayli, ubuntu is fairly well supported and sports the debian package scheme (being debian based) which makes things much more slick for installing
[07:47] <rredd4> sakka, where did you get the driver from
[07:47] <Thlayli> today i wanted to install ethereal, and recognized the port is broken :(
[07:47] <nanotube> Thlayli, ah hmm ic. well, you could try. just set off a partition for ubuntu, and do a dualboot.
[07:48] <Thlayli> i'm not a fan of dual boot
[07:48] <DBO> matheus, do a google search on trayitall
[07:48] <Thlayli> i'd have some questions in particular
[07:48] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, throw out your questions, and we will see :)
[07:48] <Thlayli> i didn't find a website where all packages are listed that ubuntu installs by default
[07:48] <DBO> matheus, wait thats wrong...
[07:48] <matheus> thanks!!
[07:48] <Thlayli> can i choose this packages during the installation-procedure?
[07:48] <matheus> ok
[07:49] <Thlayli> does ubuntu offer any kind of encrypted file-system like GELI or GBDE?
[07:49] <slackern> Thlayli: You could always do a server install that will give you a minial install without a graphical interface and build from that.
[07:49] <sakka> rredd4: I just followed the directions on the wiki?
[07:49] <Thlayli> yeah, that's cool
[07:49] <Thlayli> i love my fluxbox :)
[07:49] <Thlayli> i hate most things beginning with k ;)
[07:49] <dli> sakka, what wifi card ?
[07:50] <sakka> http://pastebin.com/732505
[07:50] <Madpilot> Thlayli, gnome is the default desktop for Ubuntu - Kubuntu is the KDE varient
[07:50] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, good thing that default ubuntu desktop is gnome, not KDE, then, ain't it? :)
[07:50] <sakka> broadcom
[07:50] <Thlayli> is xgl already integrated?
[07:50] <Thlayli> you know, xorg 7.0 was developed for linux only :(
[07:50] <Thlayli> not available for the BSDs
[07:50] <nanotube> Thlayli, no, not quite... but there are howtos on how to install it on ubuntu dapper
[07:50] <Thlayli> 6.9 was the sister release, but it does not feature xgl
[07:50] <nanotube> Thlayli, xgl, that is
[07:51] <ubuntu> how to move grub from one os so it opens another ie ubuntu
[07:51] <sakka> dli: bcm4306
[07:51] <Thlayli> i could live with gnome
[07:51] <Thlayli> how about kernel-adjustments
[07:51] <Thlayli> is there a config-file or do you all use a generic kernel?
[07:51] <Pyru> Hello can someone help me uninstall webmin completely please?
[07:51] <mugzie> does anyone know if there something besides wine
[07:51] <dli> sakka, maybe, it's the driver, try the new driver in kernel 2.6.17
[07:51] <DBO> matheus, I know there is one... but I cant seem to find it...
[07:51] <Thlayli> debian offers many possibilities to adjust one's kernel
[07:51] <mugzie> ?
[07:51] <Thlayli> so does gentoo
[07:51] <amphi> Thlayli: current config is in /boot/config-`uname -r`
[07:52] <ubuntu> DBO: o wow need your help man
[07:52] <Thlayli> ah
[07:52] <Madpilot> Thlayli, Ubuntu has simplified things a bit, but you can get under the hood if you really want to...
[07:52] <DBO> Thlayli, there are default kernels, but you can compile your own if you want
[07:52] <dli> Thlayli, you can use debian tools in ubuntu
[07:52] <matheus> ok... thanks!
[07:52] <DBO> ubuntu, ok?
[07:52] <Thlayli> that's nice
[07:52] <mugzie> anyone know something besides wine
[07:52] <ubuntu> DBO: thanks joining
[07:52] <sakka> dli: not sure how to? and should I be seeing the other "cell" ? http://pastebin.com/732505
[07:52] <Thlayli> so, my last question: how does ubuntu differ from other linux-distros?
[07:52] <matheus> I going to a google search....
[07:52] <Thlayli> from suse e.g.
[07:52] <Thlayli> or from debian
[07:53] <dli> sakka, it's not a scan problem
[07:53] <DBO> ubuntu, what exactly do you want to do?
[07:53] <dli> Thlayli, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ubuntu
[07:53] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, it's just a nice well-rounded package of all sorts of stuff. but hey, underneath, it's all linux ;)
[07:53] <Pyru> Hello can someone help me uninstall webmin completely please?
[07:54] <Thlayli> thanks for your answers. i think i'll get me an iso now and try it out :)
[07:54] <sakka> dli: ok,cool i wasnt sure
[07:54] <ubuntu> DBO; had bb server running for 6 months and just resized partition to make room for 6.06 which works fine but when i boot back to 5.10 grt this message  , -kernel panic  - not syncing - I/O error reading memory image -
[07:55] <sakka> dli: and how to for updateing my kernel?
[07:55] <Thlayli> oh yes: i nearly forgot! does ubuntu support the ufs filesystem of the BSDs?
[07:55] <DBO> ubuntu, does your 6.06 boot work?
[07:55] <sakka> or how to check what kernel im using?
[07:55] <Thlayli> or does linux in general?
[07:55] <amphi> ubuntu: 'just' resized partition?? ;)
[07:55] <I_Love_DRM> Does anyone know of a resume (CV) creator for ubuntu or a plugin for a office program?
[07:56] <amphi> Thlayli: that's a kernel issue - there is some support at least, I believe
[07:56] <ubuntu> DBO: ep no probs in a live cd just now
=== guest_ is now known as cary
[07:56] <ubuntu> amphi; ye resized partition
[07:56] <cary> hi..............................
[07:56] <Thlayli> k, is 5.10 the newest version?
[07:56] <DBO> ubuntu, are you running RAID?
[07:57] <DBO> Thlayli, that is latest stable
[07:57] <Thlayli> i'll go with that
[07:57] <Madpilot> Thlayli, 5.10 is the latest stable - 6.06 is currently in beta, will be stable on June 1st
[07:57] <ubuntu> DBO: no they are both ext3
[07:57] <DBO> Thlayli, 6.06 comes out June 1
=== cary is now known as facang
[07:57] <amphi> Thlayli: in the kernel I have here, write support is said to be 'dangerous'
[07:57] <DBO> ubuntu, did you set up the server originally?
[07:57] <Thlayli> ah
[07:57] <Thlayli> good to know
[07:57] <facang> hi..................................
[07:58] <facang> helo...............................
[07:58] <DBO> facang, hello, lay of the ...'s please =)
[07:58] <dli> sakka, hard, if you don't know how to upgrade your kernel :( try bcm43.sf.net
[07:58] <facang> asl pls
[07:58] <amphi> uptime, please, facang
[07:59] <ubuntu> DBO: bb 5-10 server is on hda1 worked fine for ages now for the the first time resized partition for 6.06 on hda2 --now this problem
[07:59] <DBO> facang, this channel is for tech support, not general chat, general chat is at #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:59] <Madpilot> facang, this isn't a chat channel - try #ubuntu-offtopic for chat
[07:59] <facang> i dnt get u
[07:59] <DBO> facang, what is your native language?
[07:59] <sakka> dli: thank you for your help ill take a look at that site
[07:59] <facang> filipino
[08:00] <sakka> thank you all who tried to help, i really appreciate the time
[08:00] <ubuntu> DBO; no sorry hda1 is bb 5-10 then swap then hda3 is 6.06
[08:00] <Madpilot> !ph
[08:00] <ubotu> Join #ubuntu-ph for tagalog
[08:00] <Thlayli> k :)
[08:00] <MM2> which command shows cards in PCI slots?
[08:00] <DBO> ubuntu, are they both using the same swap?
[08:00] <amphi> lspci
[08:00] <Thlayli> now i gotta wait 45minutes, then I'll install ubuntu
[08:00] <bimberi> MM2: lspci
[08:01] <MM2> bimberi, amphi: ty
[08:01] <Thlayli> i'm quite excited
[08:01] <Thlayli> haven't tried another OS for years
[08:01] <ubuntu> DBO; no
[08:01] <ubuntu> DBO: let me load gparted and take a loo
[08:01] <DBO> ubuntu, it looks like you deleted the swap device bb was using
[08:01] <Madpilot> Thlayli, cool - welcome to Ubuntu :)
[08:02] <ubuntu> DBO: maybe just a sec
[08:02] <DBO> ubuntu, along with that can you also get me a copy of /etc/fstab from the bb install?
[08:02] <amphi> DBO: it should still boot without a swap partition
[08:03] <DBO> amphi, yeah, I know it should...
[08:03] <DBO> but experience has taught me that what should and what does can be different...
[08:03] <amphi> DBO: I suspect initrd, but that may be pure prejudice ;)
[08:03] <DBO> amphi, Im trying to avoid going there =P
[08:04] <ubuntu> DBO: i will mount hda1 andcopy fstab
[08:07] <DBO> amphi, I suspect in the end here we are going to end up chrooting to bb, and seeing what we can do with initrd (reinstall most likely) and perhaps grub
[08:08] <amphi> DBO: aye
[08:08] <facang> dbq. asl
[08:08] <DBO> ubuntu, also a copy of /boot/grub/menu.list wont hurt
[08:08] <amphi> DBO: could just reinstall the kernel package
[08:08] <Kane666> hey
[08:09] <impostor> Howdy... can someone help me out with a GNOME issue? Fresh install of Breezy, get a login screen and a chime, but nothing else! Like that on two installs now...
[08:09] <DBO> sorry, I seem to have lagged out...
[08:09] <ubuntu> DBO: thanks a mess because there are some stuff that needs deleting anway i will pate all together
[08:09] <b00^wk> hello
[08:09] <DBO> ubuntu, also a copy of /boot/grub/menu.list wont hurt
[08:09] <DBO> amphi, I suspect in the end here we are going to end up chrooting to bb, and seeing what we can do with initrd (reinstall most likely) and perhaps grub
[08:09] <ubuntu> DBO; ok
[08:10] <amphi> DBO: could just reinstall the kernel package
[08:10] <DBO> ubuntu, if you have pasted any links, i didnt get them because my ISP is sucking lately
[08:10] <DBO> amphi, yeah I know, Im hesitant to do that from a live boot though...
[08:10] <disinterseted_pe> i need some info im trying to install a mplayer plugin and when i do cd cd Desktop ls and tar xvzf and hilite the file i get the old option requires an argument whats that mean?
[08:10] <b00^wk> I've tried installing ubuntu,  but on stage where it should install lilo or grub, it fails, and I cant boot it up,
[08:10] <b00^wk> anyone knows whats with that ?
[08:11] <amphi> DBO: should be ok, chrooted into bb, no?
[08:11] <DBO> amphi, well currently his in knoppix, so we need him to either change his sources or get an ubuntu disc
[08:11] <DBO> hes*
[08:11] <DBO> wait
[08:11] <DBO> I didnt think that through
[08:12] <b00^wk> i've tried boot up from cd in rescue mode; did that,  installed lilo config,  did lilo to mbr with success, but the thing still doesnt boot
[08:12] <DBO> ubuntu, you want to just try a shotgun fix and pray it works out? =)
[08:14] <b00^wk> ...
[08:14] <isai> does anyone know how to force all menus to have tear off handles (in kde or gnome). I really miss them...
[08:15] <noiesmo> what sort of transfer speed via samba would I get on a 10base-T network with 3 users?
[08:15] <amphi> DBO: it would seem not... :)
[08:15] <Pyru> Hello can someone help me uninstall webmin completely please?
[08:15] <DBO> amphi, its not that I didnt recognize wher this was most like going to end... i just like to check other very abnormal, but dumb things that can cause this issue too...
[08:15] <DBO> =)
[08:15] <amphi> noiesmo: ~1MB/s ? dunno how much overhead smb has
[08:16] <noiesmo> amphi, what about ssh
[08:16] <DBO> noiesmo, all going at once?
[08:16] <freakabcd> hi all
[08:17] <noiesmo> DBO, no file trans from one system to other while the other system surfs the net
[08:17] <DBO> noiesmo, a little under 1MB would be par for the course
[08:17] <freakabcd> with a Pentium-M processor, I should be running the 686 image?
[08:17] <freakabcd> cos i just noticed that i'm running the 386 image
[08:17] <DBO> eys
[08:18] <DBO> ...ok, thats it, im fried
[08:18] <bimberi> freakabcd: you can, i believe there's a performance difference, not heard anyone saying that it's particularly startling though
[08:18] <bimberi> DBO: lol
[08:18] <amphi> freakabcd: won't make a huge difference, probably
[08:19] <freakabcd> well, i figured its not using some posible shortcuts
[08:19] <DBO> freakabcd, unless your running this on a server thats constantly pegged, you wont really notice =)
[08:19] <freakabcd> umm.. i might keep this image on it as backup (386) and put the 686 one as well
[08:20] <ketsugi> isai,
[08:20] <Thlayli> what is the standard bootmanager of Ubuntu? grub? can i also choose gag during the installation?
[08:20] <ketsugi> System > Preferences > Menus & Toolbars
[08:20] <ketsugi> Check the "Detachable Toolbars" option
[08:20] <noiesmo> Is there any app in ubuntu I can use to test network card problems
[08:20] <ketsugi> I think that's the one you're looking for
[08:20] <bimberi> freakabcd: good idea
[08:20] <amphi> Thlayli: yeah, grub
[08:20] <bimberi> Thlayli: yes it's grub, the normal install doesn't offer an option (the "expert" install might though)
[08:20] <lewion> where is the ubuntu boot file again??? the file where you can change startup thingys..
[08:21] <VR_> hey guys, is it a good idea to install breezy, server only, and then run that update manager to install dapper?
[08:21] <bimberi> lewion: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[08:21] <lewion> thx
[08:21] <lewion> needed that :p
[08:21] <bimberi> lewion: yw :)
[08:22] <bimberi> VR_: the update-manager is a GUI app :|
[08:22] <VR_> >:|
[08:22] <VR_> thanks bimberi
[08:22] <Madpilot> VR_, you can still do the old fashioned dist-upgrade to get to Dapper
[08:22] <VR_> Madpilot: wouldn't i have to change my sources.list?
[08:23] <Madpilot> VR_, yes
[08:23] <filip_> how do you kill a process if you know its PID?
[08:23] <Madpilot> !upgrade
[08:23] <ubotu> hmm... upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[08:23] <VR_> Madpilot: a lot of people advised me against that approach
[08:23] <bimberi> VR_: yw :) - yeah server install, change repos, dist-upgrade, install ubuntu-desktop    (worth a go i reckon)
[08:23] <amphi> filip_: kill ;)
[08:23] <filip_> amphi, and if it still doesnt' kill it?
[08:23] <amphi> filip_: kill -9
[08:23] <DBO> kill -9
[08:23] <ubuntu> DBO: OK pasted iis there anything else besides fstab and menu.lst ?
[08:24] <DBO> kill -9 <PID>
[08:24] <isai> ketsugi, i don't mean the toolbars, I mean the menus
[08:24] <filip_> and if it still doesn't kill it?
[08:24] <ketsugi> Oh
[08:24] <ketsugi> I think that's application dependent
[08:24] <Madpilot> VR_, I've done the dist-upgrade from Hoary->Dapper, it went fine - your milage may vary...
[08:24] <amphi> filip_: it's a zombie
[08:24] <VR_> Madpilot, bimberi: thanks.
[08:24] <DBO> filip_, if a kill -9 doesnt get it, you got a zombie on your hands which isnt really a process at all and should eventually go away
[08:24] <isai> hmm...I used to use them all the time a few years ago...
[08:24] <filip_> damn, i have 3 zombie webcam processes
[08:25] <lewion> thx for the menu.lst thingy... i've edited it as i wanted
[08:25] <lewion> cya'all..
[08:25] <isai> oh well, thanks anyways ketsugi
[08:25] <amphi> filip_: can you kill the parent process? don't if it's init (pid 1)
[08:25] <filip_> amphi, can you put that in n00bspeak for me?
[08:26] <filip_> i tried to start "webcam" off konsole
[08:26] <filip_> would konsole be the parent process in that sense?
[08:27] <anndy> hey guys
[08:27] <amphi> filip_: they're zombies because the parent process hasn't read their exit status, I believe; if you kill the parent process, they should go away; but if the parent is a process called init, do not kill that
[08:27] <anndy> need help
[08:27] <filip_> how do i find the parent process of a process?

[08:30] <scottt106> Hi, I'm trying to compile a library (libid3tag) because I couldn't find it in the repository.  To "make" it, it required another library, zlib, which isn't in the repository.  After downloading them both and compiling zlib, libid3tag still doesn't find zlib installed.  Am I doing something wrong, or is there an easier way?
[08:30] <[Big] Endian> i hope you can help me
[08:30] <[Big] Endian> the problem:

[08:32] <scottt106> bimberi, i have lib3tag0 installed, but another library I'm trying to compile is calling for lib3tag... is there some way to tell it to use libid3tag0 ?
[08:33] <adrigen> how do you enable disabled groups in the application menu?

[08:33] <adrigen> anyone...
[08:33] <anndy> Package anjuta has no available version, but exists in the database.
[08:33] <anndy> This typically means that the package was mentioned in a dependency and never uploaded, has been obsoleted or is not available with the contents of sources.list
[08:33] <DBO> ubuntu, and reinstall your kernel it SHOULD fix things
[08:33] <anndy> this is wot error m getting when i select anjuta in synaptic
[08:33] <adrigen> noone...
[08:34] <bimberi> scottt106: you could try a symlink
[08:34] <ubuntu> DBO: ok but not sure how to do that just yet just post the commands or email me hem whichever
[08:34] <scottt106> bimberi, i'm a little new to linux, is there somewhere i can learn about a symlink?
[08:35] <bimberi> scottt106: kk, sec...

[08:47] <girish> hi all  can anyone help me to compile and install a package 'cvoicecontrol' on ubuntu when i tried to 'make' i got the following error message "ncurses tools.c: no such file or directory"
[08:47] <scottt106> bimberi: looks like it worked.  thanks for your help
[08:47] <freakabcd> ubuntu, let us assume you have booted the machine with a livecd (possibly ubuntu). now in a shell you mount your root partition as some mountpoint (perhaps /tmp/testmnt). then you just chroot /tmp/testmnt
[08:47] <noiesmo> ubuntu, it would be like chroot /mnt/hdax then mount -t proc /proc proc then check /etc/resolv.conf for nameserver then you could apt-get install --reinstall kernel-image
[08:47] <bimberi> scottt106: yay, np :)
[08:47] <ryanr> ok simple question..i just created a new ext3 partition...how do i mount it writable for users other than root?
[08:48] <freakabcd> now, its almost the same as being in your regular install except its not runnig that kernel. now you make use of apt with super-cow powers
[08:48] <girish> hi all  can anyone help me to compile and install a package 'cvoicecontrol' on ubuntu?... when i tried  'make' i got the following error message---- "ncurses tools.c: no such file or directory"
[08:49] <ubuntu> freakabcd: yes i am in live kubuntu cd have monuted hda1 mount  -t ext3  /dev/hda1 /mnt
[08:50] <elknof1> does anybodu knows how to change the leanguage of firefox??
[08:50] <freakabcd> elknof1, you mean inside firefox when you're viewing some page with another language (perhaps japanese) or do you mean you want to change the language of the firefox menus, tooltips, etc?
[08:51] <ubuntu> freakabcd: so next what  chroot /home?
[08:51] <freakabcd> ubuntu, err.. you're root is not /home now, its /mnt iirc
[08:51] <noiesmo> girish, you probably need the ncursers develop package
[08:51] <freakabcd> thats where you mounted it, no?
[08:51] <girish> to see avalable pages in ur language ----go to edit --->preferences---->language
[08:51] <girish> how do i get that or install that noiesmo?
[08:52] <girish> using synaptic?
[08:52] <ubuntu> freakabcd: yes I am in root sorry on live cd so again what is command chroot etc?

[08:53] <zeelot> ?
[08:54] <granden> How do I configure apache2 to use SSL(https)?
[08:54] <noiesmo> girish, not sure exact pack name but do sudo apt-cache search ncurse
[08:54] <freakabcd> granden, cd /etc/httpd/conf.d; vim ssl.conf
[08:54] <Kane666> hey
[08:54] <Pyru> anyone help me completely remove webmin , i am lost and this is my first day on linux ;) please
[08:54] <freakabcd> or perhaps vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and comment out the line with Listen 80
[08:54] <Kane666> dli: i used that command, and it didn't fix the error... ?
[08:54] <noiesmo> girish, sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
[08:55] <girish> wat does the command sudo apt-get install build-essentials do?
[08:55] <ubuntu> chroot /mnt/home or what ?
[08:55] <girish> ok noiesmo
[08:55] <freakabcd> it installs some essential build tools
[08:55] <superm1> could someone make me a recommendation on a window manager?  I'm looking to have no window decorations but still maintain a focus-follows-mouse model.  Ratpoison would be perfect had I been able to enable focus follows mouse for it
[08:55] <granden> freakabcd: Ok I will have a look thanks
[08:55] <freakabcd> superm1, i'm biased, so: e17 ;)
[08:56] <slackern> superm1: a clean fluxbox with eterm without borders?
[08:56] <freakabcd> superm1, you can set those up in fluxbox, blackbox, openbox, etc.
[08:56] <rob138> for some reason my graphics reverted to mesa from ATI, how do i fix/troubleshoot this?
[08:56] <ubuntu> freakabcd: ?
[08:56] <superm1> well id completely agree with you freakabcd, but the purpose is kinda exlclusive here
[08:56] <granden> freakabcd: I dont have /etc/httpd/conf.d but I got /etc/apache2/conf.d/ but no ssl conf
[08:56] <freakabcd> superm1, you wan only focus follows mouse, with simple window deco? then *box is your answer iirc
[08:56] <superm1> I run an xgl session on :1, but need a window manager on :0 that doesn't decorate, so I can launch video players on :0 and still be able to focus back to :1
[08:57] <superm1> so if there is "any" window decorations, xgl gets a little weireded out
[08:57] <superm1> so I can disable decorations alltogeyther on the box?
[08:57] <rob138> would changing any /sbin/init affect my graphics card
[08:57] <freakabcd> granden, i dunno how ubuntu does it. will try to help if possible. ok in /etc/apache2/conf.d/httpd.conf comment out 'Listen 80' unless you want both http and https running
[08:58] <Kane666> QUESTION: (please help!) my ubuntu computer connects to the internet via wireless router and proxy server running on a windows computer. Very ofter.. i get an error on the ubuntu computer "Connection Refused"... it just drops out :S now the problem isn't the proxy server or the router because they both worked fine on windows 2000... any ideas?
[08:58] <ubuntu> freakabcd: so were here ubuntu:root# chroot /mnt/ ?
[08:58] <granden> freakabcd: I think I know how to do it.
[08:58] <granden> You gave me a good hint
[08:58] <granden> thanks a lot
[08:58] <freakabcd> cool, you're good to go then :)
[08:58] <amphi> superm1: xgl can't handle window decorations?
[08:58] <freakabcd> ubuntu, yup
[08:58] <granden>  /etc/apache2/mods-available they got
[08:58] <granden> and ssl.load and ssl.conf is there
[08:58] <ubuntu> yep as in ok thats correct?
[08:58] <granden> just tweak it and load it I guess
[08:58] <superm1> well it can, but if your running it in a gdm session then its sort of like a nested x server
[08:59] <superm1> and if you decorate a fullscreen nested x server things don't work or look right
[08:59] <rob138> what would cause all of a sudden ati to revert back to mesa?
[08:59] <amphi> superm1: uhuh
[08:59] <amphi> rob138: missing kernel modules?
[09:00] <Kane666> annyone?
[09:00] <superm1> so I *do* decorate the session in Xgl, but I still need to manage the xgl "window"
[09:00] <rob138> amphi, what would cause those to go missing all of a sudden? would an alien rpm - deb package do something?
[09:00] <aftertaf> Kane666, you using a firewall, or wep, or anything?
[09:00] <ubuntu> freakabcd: no i have issued command chroot /mnt/  what comes next please
[09:00] <Thlayli> cya later guys & gals :) but next time I'll have a Breezy Badger running on my system ;)
[09:00] <aftertaf> Kane666, what sowfware are u using for wireless?
[09:00] <Kane666> aftertaf: there is a firewall on my windows computer (Zonealarm) no security on ubuntu.. and no encryprtion
[09:00] <therp> excuse me folks, is there anyone having trouble with unix_chkpwd? stracing that thing shows that it doesn't even touch /etc/shadow to verify any passwords, but simply bails out and gives an authorization failed to cups. that's drapper.
[09:01] <girish> hi all i still get error saying it cannot find functions "waddch", "wattr_off" etc..... related to ncurses?
[09:02] <Kane666> aftertaf: what do you mean what software for wireless?
[09:02] <girish>  hi all i still get error saying it cannot find functions "waddch", "wattr_off" etc..... related to ncurses?
[09:02] <aftertaf> Kane666, do you have any specific ports open on zonealarm?
[09:02] <rob138> amphi, i'll try a different kernel
[09:02] <aftertaf> Kane666, what drivers, i mean... :)
[09:02] <freakabcd> ubuntu, ok. apt-get --reinstall install linux-image
[09:02] <colorblue> is anyone having problems with a pciexpress nvidia card?
[09:02] <freakabcd> or whatver the kernel package you have installed is
[09:02] <freakabcd> i don;t remember the name accurately
[09:02] <girish>  hi all i still get error saying it cannot find functions "waddch", "wattr_off" etc..... related to ncurses?
[09:02] <Kane666> aftertaf: no specific ports... only the ones that i need (and worked when i was on windows 2000)
[09:02] <granden> freakabcd: How long will you be here?
[09:02] <Kane666> aftertaf: im using Ralink drivers for my d-link g510 (i think it is.. ?)
[09:02] <therp> girish: would you please stop repeating
[09:02] <ubuntu> freakabcd: just 100% as you have typed?
[09:02] <aftertaf> maybe there are prts needed open between linux and your router
[09:02] <granden> I gota go but be back in an hour or so and would need some more help with ssl
[09:02] <girish> ok sorry therp
[09:02] <granden> or are you gone then?

[09:03] <girish> therp: can u help me?
[09:03] <freakabcd> granden, i'm here alright

[09:03] <freakabcd> uh. ok. Do I have to go to school too? :(
[09:03] <granden> but I will continue to work on my server in school, on the server I am setting upp apache to only use ssl
[09:03] <aftertaf> Kane666, a gui firewall management tool.
[09:03] <granden> freakabcd: :)
[09:04] <freakabcd> what did you want to tell me, again?
[09:04] <Kane666> aftertaf: do you know the command or do i just search in synaptic?
[09:04] <granden> I need help setting upp apache2 with ssl
[09:04] <amphi> girish: what gives this error?
[09:04] <aftertaf> sudo apt-get install / or synaptic, yeah ;)
[09:04] <freakabcd> ok, and this is at school? how long will you take to get to school?
[09:04] <Kane666> aftertaf: lol i'll search in synaptic ;)
[09:05] <therp> dpkg -L gives you the files for a package. what was the inverse again? packages for file names?
[09:05] <girish> anyone knows y i get error message saying that it cannot find references to 'stdscr', 'wgetch', etc wen i tried to make the package c voice control
[09:05] <Quinch> I've got a question, if anyone feels like answering; how do I configure my soundcard to play from multiple sources?

[09:05] <girish> amphi: i get error message saying that it cannot find references to 'stdscr', 'wgetch', etc wen i tried to make the package c voice control
[09:05] <aftertaf> Kane666, ok, install it then run it. then deactivate firewall and see it that helps....
[09:05] <granden> you could just drop a pm with the basics and I can have a look at it when I get there
[09:05] <freakabcd> granden, do not fret mon ami, #apache is always here to help even if i'm not around :)
[09:05] <amphi> girish: what gives those errors, the linker?
[09:05] <aftertaf> mon ami. lol
[09:05] <granden> yeah thats true
[09:05] <granden> cya
[09:05] <granden> I gota run to my buss now
[09:05] <Kane666> aftertaf: in synaptic.. the description says its for KDE.. doesn it matter that im on gnome?
[09:06] <aftertaf> Kane666, no matter....
[09:06] <aftertaf> itll grab a few extra libraries.... thats all.
[09:06] <girish> amphi: i did './configure' in the package folder....i got no errors  then i did 'make' then i got those errors
[09:06] <Kane666> aftertaf: lol i cant download it.. its 22MB and im on 41kb/s dial-up
[09:07] <ubuntu> freakabcd: ok just to recap i have invoked chroot /mnt/  now how from inside hda1 do i issue the command dpkg-query - i linux
[09:07] <ubuntu> -l
[09:07] <aftertaf> Kane666, argh.
[09:08] <aftertaf> 41kb/s == 15 mins right?
[09:08] <freakabcd> ubuntu, after you have done the chroot. echo $PATH. /usr/bin should be there. if not add it and you should be able to run dpkg-query
[09:08] <aftertaf> ubuntu, chrooting :) nice one. good luck .... :] 
[09:08] <Kane666> aftertaf: thats my connection speed.. my download speed is like 2kb/s
[09:08] <Kane666> lol ;)
[09:08] <aftertaf> arghhhh!
[09:08] <freakabcd> Kane666, what package are you trying to get
[09:08] <freakabcd> ?
[09:08] <Kane666> lol
[09:08] <aftertaf> ok.
[09:09] <ubuntu> good luck is what i need
[09:09] <aftertaf> freakabcd, its to deactivate iptables completely. no firewall.
[09:09] <haffe> Hello. I'm looking to turn my old computer into a media player. Mythtv seems a bit overpoverd since I won't be doing any recording. So what other full screen media players are there? (To be controlled by a remote controll).
[09:09] <Kane666> freakabcd: aftertaf recommended to download guarddog to try and solve my connection problem.. look up higher to see my msg about the problem
[09:09] <aftertaf> haffe, mplayer, xine..?  with Lirc
[09:09] <freakabcd> aftertaf, huh? to deactivate it, you need to _install_ some package?
[09:09] <freakabcd> what the heck  for?
[09:10] <haffe> aftertaf: Last time I checked mplayer was rather complicated to use in fullscreen mode.
[09:10] <aftertaf> freakabcd, not exactly.... seemed the 'easiest' way between noobs ;)
[09:10] <Zvjer> mplayer is simple :)

[09:10] <haffe> Ok. Next question why is Kmplayer but not regular mplayer in dapper?
[09:10] <jocaamm> has anyone used easyubuntu?

[09:11] <freakabcd> does it run?
[09:11] <aftertaf> haffe, with universe & multiverse?

[09:14] <vladuz976> anybody here know how to use gnuplot for curve fitting?
[09:14] <aftertaf> freakabcd, Kane666   my idea was to make sure its not a firewall/port problem before blaming WIFI
[09:15] <Kane666> aftertaf: im not blamming wifi.. my wifi worked just fine in windows 2000 so it must be an ubuntu problem
[09:15] <freakabcd> iptables -F
[09:15] <Kane666> ... or so one would think
[09:15] <freakabcd> that will flush all rules on all chains if no chain is specified
[09:15] <aftertaf> Kane666, could be a wifi under linux problem.
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-work
[09:15] <Kane666> aftertaf;
[09:16] <Kane666> aftertaf: but my connection doesn't 'drop out' because if i use iwconfig ra0 i can see my connection to my AP
[09:16] <POVaddct> which "overlay filesystem" is used by the ubuntu live cd?
[09:16] <aftertaf> Kane666, so not wifi,  priori.
[09:16] <Kane666> aftertaf: huh?
[09:16] <POVaddct> i thought is was unionfs (like in knoppix) but it isn't
[09:17] <ubuntu> freakabcd yes dpkg-query -l gives the whole list in ubuntu and there are a few kernel images the one i want is lnux-image-2.6.12-10-686-smp  so here we go thecommand is apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-2.6.12-10-686-smp?
[09:17] <aftertaf> ubuntu, you on live cd cos your kernel wont boot anymore?
[09:18] <ubuntu> yes on live cd

[09:18] <ubuntu> aftertaf: lease do not give me a heart attach
[09:19] <ubuntu> freakabcd: well here we go
[09:19] <aftertaf> lol ubuntu just wondering, cos i did same as you for that reason
[09:19] <freakabcd> ubuntu, if it doesn;t work, possibly due to network setup. check that the network interface is activated and resolv.conf has the dns info
[09:20] <NF4> hello
[09:20] <NF4> can some one please help me
[09:20] <tin_nqn> hello
[09:20] <tin_nqn> somebody is here?
[09:20] <Flannel> !ask
[09:21] <freakabcd> NF4, not possible until you specify your problem and what you expect to happen
[09:21] <Flannel> bah, what's the point of that going to private messages.
[09:21] <haffe> aftertaf: Well would you look at that, turns out I had forgot to enable multiverse.
[09:21] <aftertaf> hehe
[09:21] <freakabcd> tin_nqn, yes there are many of us here
[09:21] <NF4> I was useing this guide http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2780&highlight=lm-sensors and at step three after I answered yes to every thing the system just shut down and not itw wont POST
[09:21] <tin_nqn> excelent!
[09:21] <ubuntu> freakabcd: what do you mean i am in a live cd ok I will not do it just yet because the way I installed the kernel was from a script i have a briged vmware network o my god
[09:21] <cam> hi, im testing out ubuntu, the only thing i dislike is this middle resize button ... i tried to find out in the faq if i can change it to the right button but didn't find ... any links ?
[09:21] <aftertaf> cam, window manager config.
[09:21] <freakabcd> ubuntu, huh?
[09:21] <haffe> Thanks aftertaf
[09:22] <ubuntu> on hda1
[09:22] <Kane666> ...if annyone said anything to me in the last 2-3 minutes i didn't get it because i lost my connection... (im not even sure if it showed my as disconnected?)
[09:22] <ubuntu> freakabcd: what does this reinstall do apart from the obvoius
[09:22] <freakabcd> ubuntu, did it work or not?
[09:22] <freakabcd> ubuntu, nothing special
[09:22] <ubuntu> just a sec
[09:22] <freakabcd> just what it says
[09:22] <aftertaf> NF4, looking at the guide now
[09:23] <NF4> thank you
[09:23] <NF4> I am on amd64
[09:23] <freakabcd> if it didn;t work for some reason, theres another method we can try
[09:23] <cam> aftertaf, thanks
[09:23] <tin_nqn> well... tomorrow night I have to help a friend with his "crashed" notebook..
[09:23] <aftertaf> NF4, what is the pb now? pc wont boot?
[09:23] <freakabcd> Kane666, yes you disconnected and reconnected
[09:23] <NF4> yeah it wont POST
[09:23] <kuja> sudo: unable to look up gethostname() -- my friend gets this error when merely trying to open a file, or perform many other operations, but seems to only get this from sudo.
[09:23] <Kane666> aftertaf: what was that you where saying about iptables..?
[09:23] <freakabcd> NF4, serious?
[09:23] <kuja> What's up with that?
[09:23] <Kane666> freakabcd: ok thanks ;)
[09:23] <freakabcd> Kane666, if you want to flush all rules: iptables -F
[09:24] <NF4> now I cleared the cmos and that redused it to one light meaning video card not detected
[09:24] <freakabcd> then its  the same as not running any firewall
[09:24] <Flannel> kuja: his host file is screwed up.  he can boot into single user mode (that's the "recovery mode" at the grub menu) and fix it that way.
[09:24] <Kane666> freakabcd: will that do anything 'bad'? or do you think it will solve my problem?
[09:24] <kuja> Flannel: Anything specific to look for?
[09:24] <tin_nqn> the question is... Is a run an ubuntu live cd from this notebook... how can I see its disks from my desktop machine?
[09:25] <freakabcd> Kane666, it will not do anything bad. it will do as _specified_ :: flush the rules for all chains. i.e. disable the firewall
[09:25] <Taru> Can anyone help me, I can't even open synaptic, terminal, or other applications, don't know what is going on!
[09:25] <Flannel> kuja: he needs to have his hostname in it.  basically.  you'll see a line with localhost on it, whatever comes up after the @ (like SoAndSo@ubuntu: at bash prompts) should also be on that line
[09:25] <freakabcd> if you want ti reenabled, use the firewall scripts you might have in init.d
[09:25] <tin_nqn> I'm a very newbie. I think my router can be useful to set a net, but I don't know how config it.
[09:25] <aftertaf> NF4, try reflashing your bios.
[09:26] <Kane666> freakabcd: will that solve the 'connection refused' problem? (sorry if im being pushy but this is starting to give me the s*#!s)
[09:26] <`qq`> Taru, how do you enter this channel?
[09:26] <freakabcd> Kane666, i dunno if it will solve the problem, but it will flush all the firewall rules. i.e. you're machine will not have a firewall (untill rebooted or firewall started manually)
[09:26] <aftertaf> Kane666, it might, it might not. we want you to test so we know as well as you if it works... could be different things.... ;)
[09:26] <jocaamm> i was wondering if anybody has used easyubuntu
[09:27] <cam> aftertaf, hmmm what do u mean by window manager config ?
[09:27] <aftertaf> cam, under gnome,not sure, but in kde you can configure your window manager settings to have whatever buttons you want, where you want.
[09:27] <aftertaf> same in gnome somewhere.
[09:27] <Kane666> aftertaf, freakabcd: i will try it shortly.. im updating my synaptic sources so i dont want that to stuff up .. ;)
[09:27] <kuja> Taru: Okay, this is what you should do -- Reboot, and press ESC real fast before Linux boots (when it's giving the littler timer). Then chooser the Recovery Mode, and edit /etc/hosts (sudo nano /etc/hosts) so that your hostname is in it (I think you set it up as "ubuntu"). Mine looks like this: "127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost       shugotenshi", so yours should be similar.
[09:27] <NF4> thaks I might do that
[09:28] <aftertaf> NF4, worth a try.... :/
[09:28] <NF4> I will do the long cmos clear and see that helps
[09:28] <Taru> kuja, ok
[09:28] <cam> aftertaf, yeah i see. Im using the gnome atm :/
[09:28] <kuja> Taru: Make sure yours is identical to mine, except that "shugotenshi" is "ubuntu"
[09:28] <NF4> I dont get how these sensors could have messed the mainboard up
[09:28] <aftertaf> cam, open the config module and rummage around, its there ;)
[09:28] <aftertaf> NF4, spooky !!
[09:28] <ChrisLTD> hey guys
[09:29] <ChrisLTD> got a grub problem
[09:29] <NF4> At least I had it running for three days with no problems
[09:29] <aftertaf> ChrisLTD, fire away
[09:29] <haffe> Hmm. A new problem.
[09:29] <haffe> It seems my ipod no longer automounts.
[09:31] <ChrisLTD> I got a new HD, cloned my C drive over to the new HD... Ubuntu is on my second disk... untouched... but now that the clone is finished Grub doesn't load at all... only the Windows boot loader
[09:31] <ChrisLTD> question make sense?
[09:31] <aftertaf> ChrisLTD, live cd, chroot, install grub
[09:31] <aftertaf> answer any use? :)
[09:31] <ChrisLTD> ermm
[09:31] <cam> aftertaf, cant find it :/ where is it ?
[09:31] <ChrisLTD> not sure
[09:31] <Kane666> freakabcd: i sent you a pm...
[09:31] <ChrisLTD> what happened to grub though? was it part of the MBR of my old C drive?
[09:32] <ChrisLTD> why would it have not transfered with the clone?
[09:32] <ubuntu> freakabcd: its aking need to get 19.4mb of archive after unpacking 0b of additidinal disk space wil be used yes or no?
[09:33] <Kane666> freakabcd, aftertaf: this is the output of the iptables -F command..

[09:33] <Kane666> iptables v1.3.1: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Permission denied (you must be root)
[09:33] <Kane666> Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
[09:33] <aftertaf> Kane666, use sudo
[09:33] <Kane666> oh right ...
[09:33] <aftertaf> cam, i dunno, not in gnome... :/
[09:33] <Kane666> well it done it
[09:33] <aftertaf> cam, search in gnome help for window manager settings
[09:34] <kuja> Flannel: He says he's still getting that lousy error trying to open a file from recovery mode.
[09:34] <amphi> ubuntu: this still your kernel package??
[09:34] <Flannel> kuja: he shouldnt.  In recovery mode he doesn't need to sudo, he's already root.
[09:34] <kuja> Flannel: Oh okay

[09:45] <amphi> kuja: does / need to be remounted rw?
[09:45] <amphi> kuja: probably not
[09:46] <kuja> He needs to repair /etc/hosts
[09:46] <amphi> kuja: is / mounted rw?
[09:47] <amphi> kuja: if not, he should mount / -o remount,rw
[09:47] <kuja> amphi: Not sure, but for every attempt to create a file (or modify) he gets a "no such file or directory" error.
[09:47] <geniusvicks> Sometimes I get a strange mouse cursor that shows a documnt file near the crusor and I cant change the wrokspace or click on any button until it goes why is that
[09:48] <kuja> amphi: Okay
[09:48] <amphi> kuja: really? and ls shows the files exist?
[09:48] <kuja> amphi: He's a little slow on the responsive side, but I'm asking him :)
[09:49] <amphi> kuja: heheh - why the indirection?
[09:50] <Jeronimo12321421> hi all need help, i want to change crossover office OS version
[09:50] <kuja> amphi: Okay, ls works, and shows a list of files, but the desired file indeed does not exist.
[09:51] <kuja> Nevermind, he's checking again.
[09:51] <amphi> kuja: ;)
[09:51] <ompaul> Jeronimo12321421, do crossover not give you tools to do the upgrade?
[09:52] <kuja> amphi: Okay, the file exists.

[09:52] <tHeDvL> using GNOME
[09:53] <amphi> kuja: but /etc/hosts exists, an empty file? what happens if he does cat/etc/hosts ?
[09:53] <amphi> kuja: cat /etc/hosts

[09:54] <kuja> amphi: He says he gets the same error, "no such file or directory"
[09:54] <amphi> kuja: with cat?
[09:54] <kuja> Yeah
[09:55] <ompaul> Jeronimo12321421, your still looking at a crossover issue, not a ubuntu one

[10:00] <amphi> kuja: what did he do?
[10:00] <kuja> Installed a f'ed up Ubuntu.
[10:01] <kuja> As in, the CD was totally screwed up, but got through enough stages to boot into his working distribution.
[10:01] <amphi> kuja: what was the output of ls -l /etc/hosts ? I want to know why it's red; I wondered if it was a dangling symlink?

[10:03] <ubuntu> amphi hehe yes so what to do next please
[10:04] <amphi> kuja: for now, he could just remove /etc/hosts symlink pointing to non-exixtent file, and make a new one
[10:04] <amphi> ubuntu: 'did not work' is not an error message
[10:04] <kuja> amphi: k

[10:06] <Isaiah_the_Marty> does ubuntu keep media plugins on the installation cd?
[10:07] <Zirland> Hi
[10:07] <Isaiah_the_Marty> when ever i try to watch movies i get a message saying there arent any decoders installed and i need to install a corresponding plugin
[10:07] <amphi> ubuntu: as I said before, I suspect initrd
[10:08] <Zirland> Isaiah_the_Marty: i got this problem with WMV files
[10:08] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i have it with wmv and mpeg
[10:08] <ubuntu> amphi yes you did mention that
[10:08] <Isaiah_the_Marty> do you know how to fix it
[10:08] <Zirland> Isaiah_the_Marty: i think mpeg is fine for me
[10:08] <amphi> ubuntu: you might need to recreate your initrd with initrd-tools
[10:08] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i dont have a modem so i cant download any plugins
[10:08] <amphi> ubuntu: I don't use initrd, so I can't tell you much about it
[10:09] <Zirland> Isaiah_the_Marty: i didnt solved it yet, WMV still unavailable
[10:09] <ubuntu> amphi: o what a joy nevermind life goes now nor do I
[10:09] <Zirland> Isaiah_the_Marty: i tried all codecs i found
[10:09] <Isaiah_the_Marty> damn

[10:16] <ompaul> ubuntu I checked the domain I knew who it was
[10:16] <ubuntu> ompaul: yes well your a nice guy
[10:16] <ompaul> Isaiah_the_Marty, we don't do bad langauge here, stops people getting hot under the collar :-)
[10:16] <ompaul> ubuntu, I don't resemble that remark :)
[10:17] <Isaiah_the_Marty> bad language?
[10:17] <Isaiah_the_Marty> perl?
[10:17] <ompaul> Isaiah_the_Marty, a perl of knowledge is that python is cool
[10:17] <ubuntu> ompaul: well ok maybe firm but fair?
[10:17] <ringe> The Breezy live CD hangs on "Starting Enterprise Volume Management System", log shows "root: register-modules" and it's not possible to activate console. Anyone had this problem? I've seen it twice.
[10:17] <Isaiah_the_Marty> lol
[10:18] <kuja> Flannel: Modified /etc/hosts but still getting that error :(
[10:18] <ompaul> ubuntu thanks, :-)
[10:18] <amphi> kuja: what error?
[10:18] <kuja> amphi: sudo: unable to lookup via gethostbyname()
[10:19] <ubuntu> amphi: well many thanks wish me loo reading intirid-tools is there a wiki
[10:19] <Remy_> !bash
[10:19] <ubotu> For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
[10:19] <amphi> kuja: what does his resolv.conf look like? another dangling symlink? ;)
[10:19] <Remy_> hey guys, what file do I edit to change the prompt in a terminal ?
[10:20] <Zirland> my resolv.conf is BLANK everytime i turn up the computer
[10:20] <ompaul> Zirland, I take it your using dynamic ips, this is normal
[10:20] <Zirland> ompaul: i have static
[10:21] <ompaul> Zirland, have you set one?
[10:21] <amphi> ubuntu: dunno - perhaps someone else here knows how to recreate your initrd img
[10:21] <RandolphCarter> Zirland: if you want to do something magical with resolv.conf, it's best to put it in a script that launches when your network comes up
[10:21] <ubuntu> ompaul: is there a wiki or hoto about inrid-tools please
[10:21] <amphi> ubuntu: man mkinitrd would be a place to start otherwise
[10:21] <Zirland> ompaul: yes i set it
[10:21] <RandolphCarter> you can do some clever stuff, like pinging a host to check what network you're on :)
[10:21] <ringe> Remy_: ~/.bashrc
[10:22] <ubuntu> amphi: yes thanks
[10:22] <Zirland> RandolphCarter: the only magic i want to do is "leave it alone!"
[10:22] <amphi> ubuntu: also /usr/share/doc/initrd-tools
[10:22] <Remy_> ringe - thanks
[10:23] <ompaul> ubuntu no promises but have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowTos
[10:23] <Zirland> my internet connection do not work unless i set DNS again everytime I turn up the comp.
[10:23] <kuja> amphi: Apparently not a symlink.

[10:27] <`qq`> rencrash: Linux x86

[10:28] <rencrash> `qq`, there is no such version http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers/drivers.asp
[10:28] <B1zz> he could be running a 64bit OS
[10:29] <`qq`> rencrash: u can list all version in here
[10:29] <`qq`> i'm too lazy to open it

[10:29] <RandolphCarter> Zirland: try installing the 'resolvconf' package
[10:29] <rencrash> Linux IA32
[10:29] <rencrash> Linux IA64
[10:30] <rencrash> Linux amd64/em64t
[10:30] <rencrash> freebsd
[10:30] <rencrash> thats it
[10:31] <`qq`> rencrash: Linux IA32 i think
[10:31] <Zirland> RandolphCarter: resolvconf is already installed with latest version
[10:31] <RandolphCarter> Zirland: the answer lies in /usr/share/doc/resolvconf then ;)
[10:31] <rencrash> `qq`,  you think..? will it stuff up everything if its wrong?
[10:31] <`qq`> coz you have intel-32bit proc
[10:32] <adrigen> noone?
[10:32] <flaccid> is ubuntu debian?
[10:32] <RandolphCarter> flaccid: are you your own mother?
[10:32] <`qq`> well, this sort of things usually end up with x86
[10:33] <`qq`> IA64 is for Intel-64bit proc
[10:33] <rencrash> yes your right
[10:33] <rencrash> thanks qq
[10:33] <B1zz> heheh hey qq
[10:34] <B1zz> found this http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=19509&vote=bad&tan=18081203&PHPSESSID=d2d5758cb74e13b9ce1ceb58576fe2df
[10:34] <B1zz> use alien to convert to .deb and it works :-p just installed it myself
[10:35] <NitroRebel> Hey there
[10:35] <flaccid> i hope not, otherwise i've been putting up with lies
[10:36] <flaccid> what does ubuntu use for package management and what is the extension of package?
[10:36] <Senilix> flaccid: dpkg/apt .deb
[10:36] <flaccid> .deb is debian?
[10:36] <RandolphCarter> flaccid: :P .deb yeah, debian packages
[10:37] <Senilix> flaccid: yes, ubuntu is based on debian ;)
[10:37] <flaccid> ok cool
[10:37] <I_Love_DRM> I double clicked a .deb and file roller started and said archive not supported - how are you supposed to install them.
[10:37] <`qq`> b1zz: qcomicbook huh?
[10:37] <RandolphCarter> but Ubuntu pretty much spawned from Debian, the question "is ubuntu Debian" is like asking "are you your own mother" though ^_^
[10:37] <`qq`> sounds cool
[10:37] <Pyru> Hello I am curious on how i would get a certain application when i click the x , to minimize itself to the tray!?
[10:37] <flaccid> what is the advantage of ubuntu then?
[10:37] <Unenvarjo> drm, sudo dpkg --install thepackage.deb
[10:38] <Unenvarjo> if I recall correctly.
[10:38] <NitroRebel> This DapperDrake XUbuntu is awsome. Just.. Awesome.
[10:38] <B1zz> yeah qq im reading a pred comic book atm :-p
[10:38] <Senilix> flaccid: faster release cycles, better support (imho), more polished, ...
[10:39] <Pyru> Hello I am curious on how i would get a certain application when i click the x , to minimize itself to the tray!?
[10:39] <flaccid> ok then
[10:39] <adrigen> I say... is there any reason anyone can think of that packages installed using the synaptic package manager wouldn't turn up on the system?
[10:40] <Senilix> flaccid: just google on "ubuntu vs debian" :)
[10:40] <flaccid> thanks y0
[10:40] <flaccid> i'm actually keen on getting kubuntu
[10:41] <vitali> does anybody know how can I enable all chennels in my Sound Blaster card (now playing only one channel)?
[10:42] <adrigen> can anyone acknowledge the question?
[10:43] <ringe> adrigen: Yes. You probably expect things installed on the "system" to appear in the menus. Not always so. This is not Windows.
[10:44] <ringe> That said, the package you installed probably is a library or a command line program.
[10:45] <amphi> adrigen: dpkg -L <package_name> will show you what files a package installed
[10:45] <ringe> adrigen: You should use the add/remove in the applications menu instead
[10:45] <adrigen> ringe: ok i will try.
[10:45] <ringe> amphi: on the command line, yes. Might be he's not used to it.
[10:46] <adrigen> ringe: it's g++. I guess I dont know what to expect when it is installed.
[10:46] <ringe> Anyone tried fixing NTFS problems on Ubuntu? I can't boot windows anymore.
[10:47] <Knelix> Any chance of this new Novell distribution system making it to Ubuntu at some point?
[10:47] <ringe> adrigen: How did you come upon that package in the first place?
[10:47] <adrigen> ringe: currently the application menu doesnt have a programming section... it is greyed out in the 'menu editor'. is there a way to activate it?
[10:47] <Knelix> ringe: [joke]  You should be happy!! [/joke] 
[10:48] <ringe> Knelix: I am. :) It's not my Windows. Customers.
[10:48] <Knelix> ringe: AH!
[10:48] <Knelix> Yikes!
[10:48] <ringe> adrigen: use the menu editor again.
[10:49] <ringe> adrigen: If you greyed that out: Push Alt+F2, then write "alacarte" and push run
[10:50] <ringe> adrigen: g++ is a complier. The program that makes other programs runable.
[10:51] <adrigen> ringe: i thought it had a gui...
[10:52] <amphi> adrigen: no, not g++
[10:52] <ringe> adrigen: I know. But it's not so. Compliers are command line tools. There might be guis calling the command line tools, but they're separate in that case.
[10:53] <adrigen> ringe:ok cool.
[10:53] <adrigen> ringe: "Cannot display location 'file://alacarte'
[10:53] <adrigen> Details: There is no default action associated with this location."
[10:53] <ringe> adrigen: are you using the " around it?
[10:53] <adrigen> ringe: oops
[10:54] <ringe> if you just write ala it should complete the word for you
[10:54] <adrigen> ringe: actually no
[10:54] <ringe> hm
=== kater` is now known as Kater`
[10:54] <ringe> adrigen: try gnome-terminal
[10:55] <adrigen> ringe: nope... perhaps im missing something fundamental in my understanding of how this works. (ok)
[10:55] <adrigen> ringe: you mean I should open the terminal... or type that?
[10:56] <ringe> adrigen: Open. That could mean Alt+F2 then type
[10:56] <adrigen> ringe: i get a terminal
[10:56] <ompaul> adrigen, Applications Accessories Terminal
[10:56] <adrigen> ringe: yup
[10:59] <ringe> adrigen: on the command line, go "alacarte" (without ' " ') [enter]

[11:05] <OlliK> does anyone know what package includes GD graphics library version 2.0 or later?
[11:06] <visik7> OlliK: apt-cache search ?
[11:06] <amphi> OlliK: apt-cache does - try apt-cache search libgd
[11:06] <OlliK> thanks, found it
[11:06] <adrigen> amphi: timed out oin "breezy Release.gpg" any ideas?
[11:07] <T`> anyone successful with getting 32-bit firefox in amd64 ubuntu?
[11:07] <visik7> apt-cache show libgd2 |grep ^Ver
[11:07] <visik7> Version: 2.0.33-1.1ubuntu1
[11:07] <T`> i can't get it to launch 32-bit.. Help->About says its x86_64
[11:07] <T`> dchroot -d firefox
[11:07] <eatingtheproverb> high i just started using linux and i don't quit know how to use the grub part of it any one know a good place to get comands for it
[11:07] <Ng> T`: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava
[11:08] <T`> Ng, but that uses different method.. can't i use chroot?
[11:08] <T`> dchroot i mean
=== mason is now known as _mason
[11:09] <Ng> you can use a chroot if you want to
[11:09] <T`> Ng, well, i have chroot setup, but i dont know how to tell if firefox is 32-bit or not
[11:09] <Ng> what happens if you manually chroot and run firefox?
[11:09] <T`> Ng, do i chroot or dchroot?
[11:09] <OlliK> I'm trying to set up vtiger CRM and it says: "GD Library not configured in your PHP installation."
[11:10] <Ng> T`: chroot, su to your user and run firefox. you might need to set a $DISPLAY too
[11:10] <OlliK> Does anyone know how to set up this GD Library in the PHP?
[11:10] <ubuntu> #newgrounds.com
[11:10] <T`> Ng, what is dchroot then ? i thought thats what i should be using..hehe
[11:10] <Ng> T`: dchroot is just a helper tool to make it easier. I'm suggesting you try it the manual way to see what's going on
[11:11] <T`> gotcha.. lemme do it :)
[11:12] <T`> Ng, it says firefox is already running, (which i think it shouldn't? since its 64-bit..hmm)
[11:12] <OlliK> I have now installed libgd2 but it still doesn't work.. Does anyone know how to set up the PHP to uset libgd?
[11:13] <T`> Ng, ok it started firefox
[11:13] <Ng> T`: it says that if it sees a file called "lock" in your profile. quit *any* version of firefox and remove that file
[11:14] <T`> Ng, i did, sudo chroot /var/chroot; su <username>; firefox
[11:14] <T`> now it opened a firefox, with messed up gtk themes
[11:14] <T`> looks very boxy.. heh
[11:14] <Ng> T`: does help->about suggest it's the 686 version?
[11:14] <T`> how to know if this is 32bit or not?
[11:14] <sjors_> Does anyone knows how to install the kernel-sources and compile them with DRI
[11:14] <T`> Ng, it says: linux i686 (x86_64)
[11:15] <Ng> T`: that sounds like you're running the 32bit version then :)
[11:15] <T`> Ng, uh.. but it sys x86_64
[11:15] <T`> Ng, s/sys/says
[11:15] <Ng> what does the 64bit version say in help->about?
[11:15] <eatingtheproverb> any one able to help please
[11:16] <Ng> eatingtheproverb: ask your question and find out :)
[11:16] <Mika_i_> :)
[11:16] <T`> Ng, its differnet! Linux x86_64
[11:16] <T`> Ng, no i686.. lol :)
[11:16] <Ng> T`: see :)
[11:16] <T`> Ng, may be its working.. i'll see by installing java plugin ;)
[11:16] <T`> Ng, thanks!!
[11:16] <eatingtheproverb> i need to find out were i can get some codes for the grub i need to rest my boot drive
[11:17] <spikeb> there's already 64bit java
[11:17] <T`> Ng, btw.. i get these warnings, Locale not supported by C library.. using fallback C locale..
[11:17] <T`> Ng, got 3 times..
[11:17] <Ng> T`: that probably means you need to install/configure the locales package in your chroot. This is kinda why I suggested the wiki page way of doing this because it doesn't involve the hassle of maintaining a chroot ;)
[11:17] <sjors_> Does anyone knows how to install the kernel-sources and compile them with DRI
[11:18] <eatingtheproverb> oh and is there any way to get ride of thease stupid coming and going messeges it keeps posting
[11:18] <T`> Ng, but i maintain chroot because i need to compile stuff for 32bit
[11:18] <T`> Ng, so i prefer doing this.. heh.. i dont need to have duplicate copies of 32-bit libs then
[11:18] <Ng> eatingtheproverb: I'm not sure I understand your questions - codes? rest? coming and going?
[11:18] <Ng> T`: fair enough
[11:18] <eatingtheproverb> reset
[11:19] <eatingtheproverb> sorry i can't spell very well
[11:19] <Ng> you want to reset your boot drive? meaning what? :)
[11:19] <T`> Ng, i tried to use "Blackdown JAVA" and it segfauled on loading applets
[11:19] <eatingtheproverb> im used to working in dos
[11:19] <T`> Ng, i think that packages houdl be removed from ubuntu.. its pretty useless
[11:19] <Ng> T`: blackdown sucks, use sun's java :)
[11:19] <T`> Ng, for amd64
[11:19] <eatingtheproverb> i have windows and linux on same hard drive
[11:20] <Ng> T`: ehh, no, I mean in the chroot
[11:20] <T`> Ng, no plugin for amd64 from sun
[11:20] <T`> yea.. sure
[11:20] <T`> i was talking about segfaults from firefox
[11:20] <T`> in non-chroot mode
[11:21] <eatingtheproverb> but i can't get to the windows partition so i can make it boot in windows
[11:21] <Ng> spikeb: that's very nice, but largely irrelevant ;)
[11:21] <T`> Ng, the theme looks very bad.. is there a way to change in chroot to look like my non-chroot?
[11:21] <T`> Ng, its all boxy like GTK1 or something
[11:21] <spikeb> given the pain in the ass of using 64 bit linux, it ought to be fairly relevant :)
[11:21] <Ng> T`: yes, install all the same gtk stuff that's in your main install, so ubuntu-desktop really
[11:22] <T`> Ng, xubuntu ;) ?
[11:22] <T`> xubuntu-dekstop i guess
[11:22] <Ng> that'd probably do it
[11:23] <T`> hmm.. i think sun-j2re package wont install firefox plugin
[11:23] <eatingtheproverb> ng do you know the grub comands or a website that might have them
[11:23] <cam> anyone on gnome that manage to set the right button as resize button instead of middle one ?
[11:23] <Taru> What is the command for mounting mini I-pod?
[11:23] <Ratzilla> is there an app that controls cpu usage?
[11:24] <DBO> Ratzilla, you mean like... a scheduler?
[11:24] <T`> eatingtheproverb, what commands do you want?
[11:24] <T`> eatingtheproverb, grub.conf stuff?
[11:25] <Ratzilla> DBO: i mean like a program that can lower cpu speed when it doesnt need to be at full power and the sort
[11:25] <eatingtheproverb> i need to know how to chang witch partition i boot from
[11:25] <DBO> Ratzilla, oh... yes there is... where I dont know, dont do laptops...
[11:26] <T`> eatingtheproverb, ok.. open /boot/grub/menu.lst
[11:26] <T`> eatingtheproverb, look for default= line..
[11:26] <T`> eatingtheproverb, you can change that to the number of the Label which you want to boot from
[11:27] <DBO> eatingtheproverb, or do you want to change the hdd the actual entry points to?
[11:28] <eatingtheproverb> i have windows on a difrent partition and i want to boot it up
[11:28] <DBO> eatingtheproverb, do you have an entry in grub for windows?
[11:28] <eatingtheproverb> yes
[11:28] <T`> eatingtheproverb, ok, you have to chainboot it
[11:28] <T`> eatingtheproverb, so what happens when you ask it to boot windows?
[11:28] <eatingtheproverb> thats the problem i don't know how to do that
[11:28] <eatingtheproverb> i don't know grub
[11:29] <DBO> eatingtheproverb, doesnt it present you with a list every time you boot?

[11:46] <ubuntu> hi
[11:47] <T`> Ng, wow really..
[11:47] <T`> Ng, its pretty fast for me here..
[11:47] <T`> heh
[11:47] <ubuntu> O.o
[11:47] <pepsi> it sucks having to launch firefox...
[11:47] <pepsi> click a link.. wait 5 seconds.. window opens
[11:48] <Bilford> I'll tell you how to fix it
[11:48] <pepsi> get impatient and click twice, and firefox offers a different session
[11:48] <neck_> not in my case...
[11:48] <Bilford> where are you clicking from
[11:48] <pepsi> er profile.. some shit
[11:48] <pepsi> Bilford, anything
[11:48] <neck_> works fine
[11:48] <Ng> pepsi: so leave it running :)
[11:49] <Bilford> did you do the IPV6 thing
[11:49] <pepsi> Ng, i usually do, but when its not open, it makes me click links twice thinking i missed it
[11:49] <pepsi> Bilford, ?
[11:49] <Bilford> in FF address bar, type  about:config
[11:49] <Remy_> !java
[11:49] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[11:49] <Remy_> !javadebs
[11:49] <ubotu> In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-j2re-1.5.0 is in multiverse
[11:50] <pepsi> hehe.. FF takes like 15 seconds to start on my laptop :)
[11:50] <Bilford> then  filter for IPV
[11:50] <Remy_> Hey guys, I've installed sun java from the multiverse repo, but it's not appearing in firefox as installed, anyone got any suggestions ?
[11:50] <pepsi> set that to true?
[11:50] <Bilford> Set IPV6 to true
[11:50] <pepsi> disableIpv6
[11:50] <pepsi> ok
[11:50] <Bilford> ok, that will make pages load faster
[11:51] <pepsi> i just want it to _launch_ faster
[11:51] <Bilford> as for your other problem, for example, you need to configure your IRC client to use firefox
[11:51] <pepsi> it did launch faster that time, but im guessing its from cache
[11:51] <Bilford> that wont affect launch
[11:51] <Bilford> only page loading time
[11:51] <Flannel> pepsi: the actual rendering of the page is negligible.
[11:51] <selinium_> What app gives os the tools bars? Nautilus?
[11:51] <pepsi> im not talking about rendering
[11:51] <pepsi> im saying _starting_ firefox
[11:51] <pepsi> from anywhere
[11:51] <Bilford> as for your other problem, for example, you need to configure your IRC client to use firefox
[11:51] <Flannel> pepsi: right, the page you're on (and cache, etc) doesn't affect it.
[11:52] <aftertaf> neck_, yeah e17. latest changes are nice!
[11:52] <pepsi> wtf..
[11:52] <Bilford> just firefox, with no arguments after it
[11:52] <selinium_> pepsi: Have you tried fasterfox extension from mozilla?
[11:52] <pepsi> when FF is not open at all.. and you want to run it... thats what takes long
[11:52] <Bilford> when you click a link in IRC, right
[11:52] <Bilford> configure your IRC client to use Firefox
[11:52] <pepsi> no.. starting FF
[11:52] <pepsi> :P
[11:53] <pepsi> the irc thing is fine, id ont care about that
[11:53] <Bilford> ok
[11:53] <pepsi> but thanks for the tip
[11:53] <pepsi> Bilford, you mean in xchat right? cani  make it so i dont have to ctrl-click either?
[11:53] <Bilford> check your launch button.  does it have  firefox %u
[11:54] <Bilford> for Command
[11:54] <pepsi> ya
[11:54] <Flannel> pepsi, firefox just takes forever to load.  That's the nature of the beast.  Thunderbird too, for that matter.
[11:55] <Flannel> pepsi: it does in windows, it does in linux.  Most browsers do actually.  Opera does.  IE only "doesn't" because half of it is preloaded with the OS.
[11:55] <pepsi> hmf
[11:55] <lavi> hi all,  i 've a problem while compiling source. its need automake1.9, my os just have automake1.4, so i use apt-get to install automake1.9.  however, it still print automake is 1.4 after run automake. why?
[11:56] <pepsi> is there any way to run it without having windows open? so i could run it once at login and then it'd stay open that way
[11:56] <neck_> aftertaf, i have tried E-17 on Elive but it behaves strangely on me... i still prefer E-16
[11:56] <Bilford> when you start it , do you get a little window
[11:56] <Bilford> that thinks for awhile
[11:57] <pepsi> Bilford, i only get that window if i try to launch it again while it is already in the process of launching
[11:57] <aftertaf> try new version , cvs... lovely
[11:57] <MajestiK> hi
[11:58] <neck_> later maybe... i just love this xgl working on gnome :)
[12:03] <\sh> moins
[12:10] <jirwin> hello
[12:10] <jirwin> would anyone be willing to help me find stats for my monitor?
[12:10] <`qq`> stats?
[12:10] <jirwin> specs I mean
[12:10] <jirwin> i can't find the vertrefresh
[12:10] <jirwin> it is a envision en-910
[12:10] <neck_> google it
[12:10] <`qq`> ehmm in linux you can't do that
[12:11] <jirwin> I have like crazy
[12:11] <`qq`> ALMOST
[12:11] <jirwin> ?
[12:11] <`qq`> ALMOST can't do that sort of thing
[12:11] <jirwin> can't do what?
[12:11] <`qq`> finding specs for monitor
=== kater` is now known as Kater`
[12:11] <slept> what is the reason that ubuntu can't keep hdparm settings ?
[12:12] <jirwin> well the thing is, I got this new monitor from a friend...and in xorg.conf it didn't probe it at all. So it just says 'generic monitor'.
[12:12] <vladuz976> in openoffice when you enter an equation that yields a value in that cell, can one just copy the numeric value?
[12:12] <jirwin> I want to have the full resolution of 1600x1200 instead of 1024x768
[12:12] <`qq`> but you still can enter X11?
[12:12] <jirwin> so I though I should add the horiz and vert rates
[12:12] <jirwin> yah I can
[12:13] <jirwin> it just installed ati drivers...and those work great.
[12:13] <jirwin> except...I can't get the resolution I want.
[12:13] <`qq`> this sort of thing is not VGA drivers problems
[12:13] <`qq`> but monitor driver
[12:14] <slept> jirwin, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, or edit xorg.conf
[12:14] <`qq`> in what OS your monitor can get 1600x1200?
[12:14] <jirwin> OSX and Windows
[12:14] <neck_> you need to set the right vert and horiz freqs or your monitor to get the max res. that you want
[12:14] <jirwin> I realize this. I can't find the specs for it though
[12:15] <neck_> google.. just be patient :)
[12:15] <jirwin> http://rafb.net/paste/results/MkhV1d17.html
[12:15] <jirwin> that is my xorg.conf
[12:15] <jirwin> i know that that is the correct horiz...but not sure on the vert.
[12:21] <slept> jirwin, read-edid can get them for you
[12:21] <`qq`> i think the best linux distro for "the best resolution we get on the box" is Mandr***
[12:21] <neck_> your horiz is 30-95K right?
[12:21] <jirwin> correct
[12:21] <`qq`> why don't you try it
[12:21] <jirwin> but I made up the vert
[12:21] <neck_> your max vert could be around 75.. to be safe
[12:21] <jirwin> slept, what is read-edid?
[12:21] <slept> qq, resolution has nothing to do with distros its about configuration
[12:21] <jirwin> would vert be labeled as anything else?
[12:21] <slept> jirwin, a package ... apt-get
[12:21] <`qq`> slept: well it's all about experience
[12:21] <`qq`> i said "on the box"
[12:21] <slept> jirwin, when you installed it use it like that:  get-edid |parse-edid
[12:21] <`qq`> the default
[12:21] <slept> qq, i didnt want to be rude , but if you changhe your distro for such things you wont get experience
[12:21] <Thlayli> hi :)
[12:21] <Thlayli> got ubuntu up and running :)
[12:21] <`qq`> i DON'T change distros for such things

[12:21] <B1zz> Welcome Thlayli!
[12:21] <Ng> jirwin: it's probably in universe
[12:21] <jirwin> ahh ok
[12:21] <Ng> !tell jirwin about sources
[12:21] <neck_> Thlayli, try Xgl :)
[12:21] <Thlayli> so, can anyone tell me how to get the propietary nvidia drivers? has ubuntu got a package-management system like FreeBSD or gentoo? or will i have to fetch them manually?
[12:21] <Thlayli> can't try xgl :(
[12:21] <Thlayli> got breezy badger
[12:21] <Ng> !tell Thlayli about nvidia
[12:21] <Thlayli> not the dapper drake
[12:21] <neck_> i see
[12:21] <jirwin> thanks...forgot to enable them...lol
[12:21] <spikeb> !
[12:21] <ubotu> Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, spikeb
[12:21] <spikeb> bah
[12:21] <neck_> Thlayli, run synaptic... find nvidia-glx, install it then edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[12:22] <Thlayli> i read the wiki about it
[12:22] <spikeb> :)
[12:22] <Thlayli> it said one should not attempt to install xgl with the badger
[12:22] <neck_> coz badger still uses the old xorg
[12:23] <neck_> xgl works best on xorg7
[12:23] <jirwin> got it :)
[12:23] <jirwin> vert is 50-160
[12:23] <Thlayli> i thought it only works with xorg7
[12:23] <Ng> Thlayli: yeah, you want to be using dapper to try xgl really, but it's out very very soon :)
[12:23] <Thlayli> i know
[12:23] <Thlayli> a week or so
[12:23] <spikeb> xgl is crap heh
[12:23] <jirwin> brb thanks.
[12:23] <Ng> a week on thursday
[12:24] <neck_> i think what they are going to release is still an RC
[12:24] <B1zz> what is xgl? someone give me a link pls
[12:24] <Thlayli> well, so far i really like ubuntu; it's fast, it did configure nearly everything on its own...
[12:24] <mbrother> hola
[12:24] <Ng> spikeb: so you think, others think otherwise. this is a support channel, #ubuntu-offtopic is for opinions/rantings/whatever :)
[12:24] <spikeb> Thlayli: it's quite nice, eh
[12:24] <Ng> B1zz: google :)
[12:24] <B1zz> :-p
[12:24] <Thlayli> yeah, i could get used to that :D
[12:24] <eatingtheproverb> Ng ok i tryed to do the /boot/grub/menu.lst thig and no such luck
[12:24] <spikeb> Ng: i know, i am there as well
[12:24] <B1zz> duh
[12:24] <B1zz> ty ng
[12:24] <Ng> spikeb: well then :)
[12:25] <Thlayli> k, i'll try to individualize my kernel now
[12:25] <Thlayli> i need ufs support and some more things
[12:25] <Ng> Thlayli: ufs should be in the default kernel package
[12:26] <Ng> indeed most things should be
[12:26] <jirwin> hey again
[12:27] <jirwin> ok...so I set the monitor up now...but still can't change the resolution.
[12:27] <jirwin> do I need to add modes?
[12:27] <`qq`> Mode Line
[12:28] <B1zz> omg you mean you can get that cube shapes thing with xgl!
[12:28] <neck_> how about adding the res you want on xorg.conf on Subsection "Display"
[12:28] <jirwin> under the depth that I want?
[12:28] <jirwin> i have lots of subsection "Display"s
[12:28] <neck_> yeah... 24

[12:51] <ubuntu> Mg: iYes i was very suprised at how quick your reply came i am on the way out ubuntu has kernel panic which i cannot fix so this happened just after installing sarge so I thought I would a simple question sorry to be in the wrong channell but if you take a look at that line its relly long with all the - and +
[12:52] <Ng> ubuntu: well it looked to me like you had just typed it wrong. use tab completion :)
[12:52] <Ng> if you're getting kernel panics, please report a bug at launchpad.net
[12:53] <ubuntu> Mg: does it make sense take a peek at the url please
[12:54] <beanz> Where are ubuntu testing kernels held?
[12:54] <Ng> ubuntu: if you're on sarge it'll be fine I expect
[12:55] <ubuntu> Mg: i have tried tab completion before just give me a quick reminder please
[12:57] <Ng> ubuntu: type the first few characters of the filename and hit tab, it'll fill it out for you
[12:58] <ubuntu> Mg: as in dpkg -i loop-aes--2.6.8 then tab?
[12:59] <fyrestrtr> exit
[12:59] <Ng> ubuntu: I'd just do dpkg -i loop and hit tab
[12:59] <Ng> because I don't think there should be two - there
[12:59] <Ng> but you can also do an ls and just copy/paste the name
[12:59] <ubuntu> Mg ok thanks
[01:00] <Ng> it's Ng!
[01:00] <Ng> not Mg ;)
[01:00] <neck_> hahahha you noticed at last

[01:01] <neck_> Ng, have you tried using gyach-enhanced?
[01:02] <waqas> .
[01:02] <Ng> neck_: nope, never heard of it
[01:02] <waqas> hi everyone
[01:02] <suppaman> is there a way to resize an existing ntfs partition ? I'm gonna installing ubuntu on a friend's of mine pc and I would like to be the less traumatic possible (for him)
[01:03] <suppaman> beanz: indeed it is
[01:03] <neck_> Ng, its an IM thats specifically supports YM protocol... supports webcam...
[01:03] <Ng> neck_: I barely use IM, sorry :)
[01:03] <neck_> just having a little issue :) .. thanx anyway
[01:04] <Ng> suppaman: in theory the installer can do it. I would strongly recommend taking a backup first though
[01:05] <suppaman> Ng: it's a standalone computer (dial up connection), I don't know if it has a cd burner at all
[01:06] <suppaman> Ng: he thinks the computer is getting old, I think it'd just need a ram bump and a decent os
[01:06] <Ng> suppaman: resizing partitions is never guaranteed to be safe, it's a pretty invasive thing to do. got a spare hard disk you could take a copy to?
[01:06] <sybariten> trying to install "tomboy" which relies on libgnome-cil, which relies on libgda2-1, but apt vomits ....  anyone recognize ?
[01:06] <suppaman> Ng: I worry it hasn't either got an ethernet card..
[01:07] <sybariten> (i'm on hoary)
[01:07] <suppaman> Ng: wait, I've got a spar hd usb box
[01:07] <suppaman> I'll put his hd into the box and will reverse his data on my ibook
[01:07] <suppaman> Ng: that's tha way
[01:08] <sybariten> besides, i found the .deb package and downloaded it ... whats gonna happen now if i dblclick that mother directly? End of the world ?
[01:09] <gir_> Is there any way to decrease the "wobblyness" on the menus? (XGL)

[01:21] <Ng> sybariten: packages that are from a later version of ubuntu but have been rebuilt for the current version
[01:21] <sybariten> but apt gets a lot of 404 errors ?
[01:21] <ndlovu> !backports
[01:21] <ubotu> backports is, like, totally, Add "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-backports main universe multiverse restricted" (without the ") to /etc/apt/sources.list.  More info @ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports
[01:22] <linux_galore> hmm
[01:22] <sybariten> ndlovu: ok but can i know if that url that ubotu gave, is for hoary?
[01:23] <ndlovu> sybariten: breezy-backports should be appropriate for hoary (AFAIK)
[01:23] <Subhuman> hi, im replacing my old nvidia geforce graphics card for a nvidia 6200, will i need to reinstall any drivers? because dont all nvidias use the same driver?
[01:24] <misieq> how do i partition apple disk?
[01:25] <grte> Subhuman: The same driver should work, you might have to edit your xorg.conf a bit, but I don't even know if you'll have to do that.
[01:25] <Subhuman> well ill see how it goes.

[01:35] <toodles> Hi everyone. I've only just noticed that Sun's Java is now available from Multiverse. The entry on the wiki, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedRestrictedDapper does not yet include this. It also explains that the only version of using blackhawk java is that it's in the repository. I would have updated the wiki myself, except I don't know enough about the change or whether to now remove the blackhawk java entry from the wiki. It does seem a bit po
[01:35] <toodles> intless now that Sun Java is also in the repository. Any idea who I should point this out to?
[01:35] <livingdaylight> I want to ask how i can create a link to a site i want people to see without having to have the whole url be seen. To just paste the whole url is crude and ugly. For example i want to have the word 'awesome' highlight and when clicked on take theperson to the link
[01:36] <C|int> dang FreeBSD easy lol... easier than learning linux
[01:36] <C|int> unix just feels different is all :-)
[01:36] <toodles> Everyone, I ment reason not *version
[01:36] <njan> C|int, it also does about half as much stuff :P
[01:36] <C|int> dam fast system too.. blows everyone I have used away lol
[01:36] <sovieticool> i do this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14549
[01:36] <tubbie> is there a free open source limewire alike software?
[01:36] <livingdaylight> This is from my blogg and i want to createa link to 'youtube' where i havea video i want people to see when clicking on the word 'awesome'
[01:36] <C|int> nah, you can work backwords compatible with it, I'll be installing VMware workstation on it :-)
[01:36] <sovieticool> please look if are corect ?
[01:36] <sovieticool> i have a samsung lcd 920n 19''
[01:37] <livingdaylight> not exactly Ubuntu related, ok, but maybe someone knows the anser or what would be a better Chat room to take this question to
[01:37] <C|int> plus, VMware for linux runs faster on FreeBSD than it does on linux lol :P
[01:38] <sovieticool> help me someone ?
[01:38] <livingdaylight> help me someone too please
[01:38] <neck_> sovieticool, you might want to install the nvidia proprietary drivers for your graphics card.... in that case, you should change the "nv" to "nvidia" on section device driver
[01:38] <Ng> this is not the place to discuss the relative merits of freebsd/linux, please use #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:38] <livingdaylight> Ng, can you help me
[01:38] <livingdaylight> ?
[01:39] <C|int> hey njan

[01:40] <C|int> k.. :)
=== sub|upd|kaffee is now known as subsinker
[01:40] <bimberi> toodles: it's a wiki, feel free to change it yourself.  Keep in mind that Sun Java is only available in dapper's multiverse and it is still in beta
[01:40] <Ng> livingdaylight: no, you probably need a keyword plugin for your blog software or something. *shrug*
[01:40] <livingdaylight> C|int: i want to create a link from my blog to a video in youtube.com by using a word not pasting the whole url
[01:40] <Ng> toodles: the ubuntu-sounder or ubuntu-devel mailing lists would probably be a good place to ask. search the archives first though, there have already been some discussions about the sun jre packages
[01:40] <livingdaylight> Ng: *shux* : )
[01:40] <Remy_> hey fellas, what are any other cool / funky / usefull apps or games or settings or whatever that you install with ubuntu ?
[01:41] <Remy_> give me your favorite :)

[01:41] <bimberi> Remy_: cowsay :)
[01:41] <C|int> IRC handl'es different url associations differently, and the owenrs and ops of this channels might get nippy at ya

[01:42] <livingdaylight> C|int: where could i take this question to if not the #ubuntu channel

[01:42] <sovieticool> lol nice rez :D
[01:42] <nandemonai> I wondering if anyone has had a problem in Firefox where if multiple tabs are set as the home page and then you hit the homepage button more than once it will not check if said tabs are already loaded and goes ahead and opens up another set continually...?
[01:42] <C|int> heck, I'm here, and I'm not even using ubuntu right now, I'm taking a break from it , til I get, the latest, Dapper Drake, however, its all just a test, I Plan to get some donations from the people, and then send money to ubuntu, and buy apparel, and also, I am working with FreeBSd, because its really fun, and its really fast,
[01:42] <sovieticool> 1280x1024 ;))
[01:42] <neck_> good for you then sovieticool
[01:42] <Ng> sybariten: yes
[01:42] <blue-frog> sybariten, if you compile it yes
[01:42] <sybariten> hm
[01:42] <sybariten> i dont wanna compile, really
[01:42] <sovieticool> how i see if i have 32 bit or 24 bit ?
[01:43] <blue-frog> sybariten, then you have tomboy as a package in synaptic
[01:43] <sybariten> but i am trying to track down why i cant install it on this PPC Hoary install
[01:43] <neck_> it's in your xorg.conf... 24
[01:43] <Remy_> anybody else ?
[01:43] <neck_> and 32
[01:43] <neck_> your default is 24
[01:43] <abrar> *** I have this internal conexant modem, and I'm having to downlaod a driver which wont fully use my modem's capability, cuz im not PAYING for it!!! This driver provider LINUXANT actually asks for around 19$ for this. My 56K DATA/Voive?FAX modem is only limited to 14kbps of data now!! ANY ALTERNATIVE to This?
[01:43] <sovieticool> it will be better to set it to 32 or to 24 ?
[01:43] <C|int> remy
[01:43] <Remy_> C|int  ?
[01:44] <neck_> depends on your preferences....
[01:44] <C|int> I installing, fluxbox, on FreeBSD, then I am going install VMware, then run Windows tightly secured into it, having a virtual environment, and waiting on next release of ubuntu to arrive at my house :-)
[01:44] <Remy_> lol
[01:45] <sovieticool> !floppy
[01:45] <ubotu> To mount floppy disks, see here : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MakeFloppyDriveAvailableToEveryone
[01:45] <Remy_> I'm dual booting, so don't need to vm ;-)
[01:45] <C|int> hee :-)
[01:45] <C|int> remy,
[01:45] <C|int> I am running 3 partitions as well ,
[01:45] <C|int> using Acronis Disk Director Suite,
[01:45] <Remy_> wow
[01:45] <Remy_> :)
[01:45] <C|int> I use to run 5 , on my laptop, and 10 on my workstation lol
[01:45] <sybariten> ok synaptic says i have a "broken" package. How do i locate it ?
[01:45] <C|int> you can run as many as you want, etc, and have like 50 OS on 1 hard drive, and so on
[01:46] <C|int> technology with Operating system, really simpler than it looks.. you just have to challenge yourself
[01:46] <C|int> dual booting , heh, thats old news
[01:46] <sovieticool> know some one ..new kernell is stable to edit ntfs ?
[01:46] <abrar> *** I have this internal conexant modem, and I'm having to downlaod a driver which wont fully use my modem's capability, cuz im not PAYING for it!!!

[01:46] <Remy_> C|int - what exactly does fluxbox do /
[01:46] <C|int> see, running Windows, on a fluxbox, is totally different than dual booting remy
[01:47] <Ng> sovieticool: no
[01:47] <C|int> its pretty much the most secure you can put a windows system in,
[01:47] <Remy_> ahk
[01:47] <sybariten> blue-frog: synaptic says: tomboy:
[01:47] <sybariten>  Depends: libgnome-cil but it is not going to be installed
[01:47] <sovieticool> ok Ng thax :)
[01:47] <redloff_> http://redloff.bash.pl/error.jpg
[01:47] <redloff_> what is this error?
[01:48] <sovieticool> o i can't mount my floopy :(
[01:48] <hexidigital_> C|int: does that allow usb support/wireless network support? (i'm running a broadcom chipset on my laptop, and bcm43xx-fwcutter isn't cutting it... pardon the play on words)
[01:48] <Ng> redloff_: looks like your pop3 email configuration details are wrong
[01:48] <redloff_> Ng, they are identical with the ones for other user on the same server
[01:48] <blue-frog> sybariten, then you may have to enable other repositories...
[01:48] <Ng> redloff_: the server doesn't seem to think so
[01:48] <redloff_> the other user works fine, this one does not (works under win however)
[01:49] <redloff_> Ng, how can I debug it? what does the message say?
[01:49] <Ng> redloff_: the -ERR bit is what the server said. you could test it by telnetting to the pop3 server and sending the same details by hand I suppose
[01:51] <redloff_> I've telneted on 110 port
[01:51] <redloff_> how to check it now?
[01:51] <sybariten> blue-frog: i think i already have done that ...?  does synaptic need a go signal after ive done that ?
[01:51] <sybariten> ive added backports, i believe
[01:52] <Ng> redloff_: send USER yourusername
[01:52] <Ng> redloff_: then hit enter and send PASS yourpassword and hit enter
[01:52] <Ng> redloff_: it will either say +OK or -ERR

[02:59] <spikeb> cA1mAn: you could remove libgtk and then reinstall xubuntu-desktop
[02:59] <DBO> ubuntu, you should be able to select an older kernel in your grub that is still installed (it should work) and from there we can start working on the smp kernel
[02:59] <cA1mAn> spikeb: so removing libgtk will do what exactly?
[02:59] <DBO> ubuntu, the script just installed a new kernel, it did not uninstall the old one
[02:59] <ubuntu> DBO; i am in a live CD now so i will leave the channel and come back

[03:35] <rencrash> does ubuntu 5.10 have a C compiler
[03:35] <rencrash> ?
[03:36] <Ng> rencrash: yes, install the build-essential package
[03:36] <GigaFisse> i like sharp fonts--- oh so sweet
[03:36] <Ng> Paradoxx: the amd64 version is an officially supported platform and should offer an smp kernel
[03:36] <GigaFisse> Thanks.. i like to keep it short, especially in the summer
[03:37] <mjr> Paradoxx, in breezy, you probably need to install an smp kernel package with synaptic, and then it should work ok. In the upcoming dapper release, the default amd64 kernel will support smp (also dual core, that is)
[03:38] <MistaED> gigafisse: if you run kde, there's also options to set it so fonts that are point 10 or smaller are not anti-aliased, but anything bigger is (how XP does it i think) but gnome can do the same thing if you tweak some conf files (not sure how exactly, but there are posts on ubuntuforums.org)

[04:19] <mnk> hello all - could anyone explain how this vmware works? there r different types: server / workstation / player etc. i'm not sure which one i need to run my existing windows within ubuntu.
[04:19] <lobstu> or, at least, i think so
[04:19] <paradizelost> lobstu: is this from the first created account?
[04:19] <lobstu> mnk workstation i think
[04:19] <lobstu> paradizelost : yes
[04:19] <lobstu> the one i created when i installed ubuntu
[04:19] <paradizelost> lobstu: k
[04:19] <mnk> but workstation is expensive :)
[04:19] <mnk> i heard server is free now
[04:20] <lobstu> how do i get it so that i can sudo again paradizelost ?
[04:20] <paradizelost> mnk: what do you mean run your existing windows ?
[04:20] <paradizelost> lobstu: can you do a sudo su -
[04:20] <paradizelost> ?
[04:20] <paradizelost> don't kill me gnomefreak
[04:20] <lobstu> nope
[04:20] <mnk> also, do i have to reinstall windows or will vmware let me use the current one i have?
[04:20] <lobstu> i can log in as root separately
[04:21] <paradizelost> mnk: what the hell do you mean by the current one?
[04:21] <paradizelost> installed on a different partition?
[04:21] <mnk> hehe - i already have windows installed on a different partition
[04:21] <mnk> yeah
[04:21] <lobstu> mnk : no
[04:21] <lobstu> new one
[04:21] <mnk> drat
[04:21] <paradizelost> mnk: that you will NOT be able to run, as VMWare virtualizes ALL hardware
[04:21] <lobstu> cos the vm is a different 'machine' .. needs to be reinstalled

[04:22] <defcon8> why should that not work?
[04:22] <lobstu> any ideas paradizelost ?
[04:22] <marson> What happens if I remove the ubuntu-desktop package?
[04:22] <paradizelost> lobstu: if you log in as root and look at /etc/sudoers, make sure you still have the line for %admin
[04:22] <tristanmike> tubbie, please use "/msg ubotu <factoid>" to get personal facts from ubotu so the channel doesn't get messy :)
[04:23] <gnomefreak> marson: nothing
[04:23] <apokryphos> marson: /msg ubotu metapackage
[04:23] <tubbie> ok :)
[04:23] <marson> ok
[04:23] <paradizelost> mnk: as far as the version, it depends on what all you want to do
[04:23] <apokryphos> marson: nothing bad will happen, but please make sure you have it installed before you upgrade.
[04:23] <lobstu> %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL that line ?
[04:23] <apokryphos> marson: otherwise you risk borking your system.
[04:23] <Iam8up|lpy> is it possible to SSH into a box that's running the ubuntu LIVE cd?
[04:23] <lobstu> that line is in there
[04:23] <roll> what!s the name of the cd writer application?
[04:24] <tristanmike> roll, k3b
[04:24] <apokryphos> Iam8up|lpy: sure
[04:24] <paradizelost> mnk: Vmware player plays existing machines, vmware workstation lets you have multiple snapshots, and the vm ONLY runs when you have the vmware program open, vmware server only lets you have 1 snapshot, but the vm's run in the background on boot if you set it so
[04:24] <tristanmike> roll, or gnomebaker
[04:24] <paradizelost> lobstu: yah that one.
[04:24] <Iam8up|lpy> apokryphos - is it the default port..?
[04:24] <apokryphos> Iam8up|lpy: sure
[04:24] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: the update-manager -d will install it for you ;) last i heard anyway. in the next few days ill be loading my test system and trying it ;)
[04:24] <paradizelost> lobstu: ok to PM you?
[04:24] <lobstu> yes, please!
[04:24] <Iam8up|lpy> because when i try to, on port 22, i get a refusal
[04:24] <paradizelost> i've got some recommendations that some people would freak out if i posted in the room
[04:24] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: not sure if it does, but not everyone upgrades that way.
[04:24] <Iam8up|lpy> and i'm sure it's there, on the network, because i can ping it just fine
[04:24] <apokryphos> Iam8up|lpy: correct username/pass?
[04:25] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: true its always safe to make sure you have it ;)

[04:26] <apokryphos> tavancini: clear it? Why would you want to?
[04:26] <gnomefreak> tavancini: there is no gui for clearing mbr
[04:26] <tavancini> because i uninstalled my grub...
[04:26] <apokryphos> tavancini: anyhow, GNU/Linux tends to use bash, not DOS. And you'd almost certainly have to use the terminal
[04:26] <gnomefreak> tavancini: fixmbr should do it
[04:26] <tavancini> and it is still resides there :S
[04:26] <Iam8up|lpy> how would i boot into linux w/o an mbr..?
[04:26] <disinterested_pe> can someone help me install a mplayer plug in?

[04:27] <gnomefreak> disinterested_pe: enable universe and multiverse than type sudo apt-get install mplayer-386  or replaces 386 with your arch
[04:27] <benoy> does anyone know how to remove samba from the command line?
[04:27] <disinterested_pe> ive done that apokryphos
[04:27] <thefish> benoy: apt-get remove samba
[04:27] <benoy> I recently installed it and I have been getting a lot of errors
[04:27] <benoy> ahh
[04:27] <Iam8up|lpy> with a live cd...which one has fixmbr? ubuntu? all of them? i always thought that drives weren't writable
[04:27] <Iam8up|lpy> (under a live cd)
[04:28] <miter> hello, how to separate arguments in a command? For example: for "rm file1 AND files2" , what would be the "AND" ?
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> miter - just like that, without the and
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> rm file1 file2
[04:28] <miter> a space?
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> yep
[04:28] <miter> and if a file has a space in it?
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> "file 1"
[04:28] <disinterested_pe> but obviously i dont have the correct plugins installed for streaming audio
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> "dont use spaces"
[04:28] <miter> for ex. ubuntu manual.pdf
[04:28] <Iam8up|lpy> wait no
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> i think "file\ 1"
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> you might need a backslash...
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> just hit tab, it'll do it for you
[04:29] <gnomefreak> no rm file1 file2 was right
=== qiqica is now known as uuu
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> gnomefreak - but if file1 is actually file 1
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> with a space in the middle
[04:29] <tristanmike> gnomefreak, not if one of the files has a space in it's name, that was the question I think
[04:29] <Iam8up|lpy> do you need a \ for the space to get it?
[04:29] <gnomefreak> Iam8up|lpy: change the name of it to use a _ or -
[04:29] <orbin> yes
[04:29] <miter> but if it called "file 1" and "file 2" and i also have a file in the folder called simply "file2???
[04:29] <tristanmike> gnomefreak, lol
[04:30] <Iam8up|lpy> either case...just type the beginning of the file and hit tab
[04:30] <Iam8up|lpy> it'll figure it out for you
[04:30] <nf4> I was wondering if I should make the hz of my monitor set to what it is rated it is rated a maxium  83Khz horizontal but under the set resilution tab it seems to be set at 60Hz
[04:31] <miter> but if I have files called "file 1" and "file 2" and i also have a file in the folder called simply "file", which SHOULD NOT be removed???
[04:31] <disinterested_pe> if i use sudo nautilus and open the root and move the folder for the plugin into the mozilla files will that install it?
[04:31] <Iam8up|lpy> miter - if you do an rm "file 1" and "file 1" is a folder it won't work, you need -r
[04:31] <apokryphos> disinterested_pe: ideally you shouldn't ever run sudo {guiapp}, really
[04:31] <apokryphos> !kdesu
[04:31] <ubotu> Use kdesu to run graphical applications with root priveleges when you have to. Do *not* do sudo {GUIAPP}; you can muck up your permissions and the config files.
[04:32] <apokryphos> or gksu/gksudo on gnome
[04:32] <Iam8up|lpy> miter - and if you do -r then the folder and anything inside of the folder will be removed
[04:32] <disinterested_pe> hummmm
[04:33] <roll> how can i share my internet connection?
[04:33] <Iam8up|lpy> roll - smoothwall.org or google monowall
[04:33] <miter> Iam8up|lpy: no i mean if, IN a folder, i have 2 files: "file 1" and "file", do i have a risk, when typing "rm file 1" that "file" will be removed (because of the space between file and 1)
[04:33] <jono> which package should a user install to install java?
[04:33] <disinterested_pe> well, the instructions that r on the site where i got the plugin doesnt work cause make isnt a command here
[04:33] <apokryphos> jono: /msg ubotu javadebs
[04:33] <tristanmike> miter, "rm file 1" won't work, it will try to remove "file" and ignore the "1"
[04:33] <Iam8up|lpy> miter - "file 1" will be "file 1" it won't touch file, which is why i suggest using tab completion
[04:34] <jono>  /msg ubotu javadebs
[04:34] <cerberu1> hi
[04:34] <nf4> jono have you looked that the ubuntu FAQ?
[04:34] <apokryphos> jono: no space
[04:34] <nf4> they explain all the differant java's
[04:34] <miter> tristanmike, so how to separate then?
[04:34] <nf4> I used blakhawk or something like that
[04:35] <jono> what is the mozilla java package?
[04:35] <Iam8up|lpy> jono - google "java run time"

[04:35] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[04:35] <Iam8up|lpy> you'll go to a page, and sun's page will help you
[04:35] <tristanmike> miter, rm "file 1" "file 2"
[04:36] <Iam8up|lpy> or..that
[04:36] <jono> Iam8up|lpy: there is an Ubuntu package though
[04:36] <Ng> hey jono :)
[04:36] <Iam8up|lpy> miter - if theres a space between the files you'll do an rm on each
[04:36] <Iam8up|lpy> jono - sorry, i'm not a ubuntu guy =)
[04:36] <miter> so i have to put them in ""
[04:36] <miter> ?
[04:36] <Iam8up|lpy> mit type rm
[04:36] <NoUse> jono ask ubotu about java and javadebs
[04:36] <Iam8up|lpy>  then space
[04:37] <Iam8up|lpy>  then type the first few letters of the first file you want to kill
[04:37] <Iam8up|lpy> then hit the TAB key
[04:37] <tristanmike> miter, yes, but it can get complicated, that's why you don't use spaces in Linux
[04:37] <Iam8up|lpy> it'll autocomplete it, if you have spaces it'll quote them for you
[04:37] <Iam8up|lpy> tab completion will not fail you
[04:37] <miter> ok, thanks Iam8up|lpy and tristanmike
[04:37] <jpjacobs> never mind found how to change my cursor : xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr
[04:37] <tristanmike> miter, there are several ways of handling files with spaces in their name, but the best one is not to have spaces at all
[04:38] <miter> or thanks Iam8up|lpy[SPACE] tristanmike
[04:38] <tristanmike> LOL :P
[04:38] <nf4> any one use IM sensor?

[04:42] <Nailor>  /wii Nailor
[04:42] <Nailor> Damn great.
[04:43] <roll> is there a ftp client?
[04:44] <Nailor> In Ubuntu? Places -> Connect to Server... should do something (haven't tested though)
[04:44] <defcon8> roll, ftp
[04:44] <Nailor> Oh yeah, and ftp on command line.
[04:44] <defcon8> Nailor, what is wrong with ftp?
[04:45] <nf4> some one told me that I wasnt allowed to install flash on ubuntu is that true?
[04:45] <roll> anything with a gui?
[04:45] <tristanmike> not at all
[04:45] <defcon8> nf4, wtf?
[04:45] <Nailor> roll: The one I said.
[04:45] <tristanmike> !tell nf4 about flash
[04:45] <defcon8> roll, what makes you scared of using command line tools?
[04:45] <defcon8> there is nothing wrong with them
[04:45] <defcon8> just learn a bitr
[04:45] <roll> yeah i know
[04:45] <defcon8> roll, and if you insist: apt-cache search ftp
[04:46] <nf4> They said they had some stupid rule about it or something
[04:46] <nf4> is that only in america?
[04:46] <Nailor> defcon8: No need for that. Nautilus can handle ftp protocol otb
[04:46] <roll> okey
[04:46] <tristanmike> nf4, no, it just means that Ubuntu can't "ship" with flash, but it can be installed
[04:46] <roll> nautilus
[04:46] <Nailor> If drag & drop actions are satisfying.
[04:46] <nf4> oh i see
[04:46] <mnk> hi ppl - anyone know how to run arabic programs under wine?
[04:46] <nf4> same with dvd's and things like that
[04:46] <mnk> when i try to run an arabic program i just get loads of ?????
[04:47] <tristanmike> nf4, exactly
[04:47] <Nailor> roll: Do the tricks I said. Go Places -> Connect to Server... Insert all required data and click Connect. After that, places-menu should have your ftp-site in there.
[04:47] <Nailor> No need for learning command line tools (if you dont want to) and no need to install new software
[04:47] <me> Hello all.  I am very new to the Ubuntu and Linux world but am tryig to learn more by installing Ubuntu.
[04:47] <loststar4545> i need help with the busid  in the device section of xorg.conf  i did lspci  and it  gave me  0000:010b:0 i am trying to set my nvidia  5500 to work
[04:47] <roll> thx nailor
[04:47] <orbin> me: welcome
[04:47] <me> I am getting an error message I can't figure out though...
[04:48] <nf4> this has every thing you need to learn about ubuntu
[04:48] <nf4> http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/index.html
[04:48] <me> Yep, I've combed the net for an answer before coming here.
[04:48] <me> Run a few google searches and looked through the forums...
[04:49] <orbin> loststar4545: how is it not working?
[04:49] <Nailor> loststar4545: If that's your only display device, X should be able to detect it automatically. Try to comment out busid-line
[04:49] <Veidit> Good evning, I would like to update my kernel from 386 to 686 but as soon as I do X seems to be quite corrupted with the colors, what could I have missed?
[04:49] <tristanmike> me, are you familiar with "pastebin" ?
[04:49] <loststar4545> when i start up my pc  i get  a  flashing  underscore  so  i was told to redo my xorg.conf
[04:49] <orbin> Veidit: how did you install the 686 kernel?
[04:50] <loststar4545> i have on board graphics
[04:50] <me> After I have partitioned my HD in the installer it gets to the base install but freezes on getting zlib1g.
[04:50] <mnk> when i try to run an arabic program under wine i just get loads of ????? any help would be appreicated
[04:50] <roll> is there a commander type application?
[04:50] <me> It then quits saying it has logged the message in a log file.
[04:50] <Iam8up|lpy> mnk - you need to install a font for arabic...
[04:50] <Nailor> loststar4545: If X doesn't start, try to go throgh /var/log/Xorg.log (or Xorg.0.log) to debug the problem
[04:50] <orbin> roll: as in midnight cmdr? install mc
[04:51] <roll> okay
[04:51] <tristanmike> loststar4545, can you type anything at this cursor ?
[04:51] <Iam8up|lpy> mc kicks all ass
[04:51] <Iam8up|lpy> win3.11 style
[04:51] <loststar4545> nope i have to go to recovery mode
[04:51] <tristanmike> loststar4545, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" ?
[04:51] <roll> xnc?
[04:51] <tristanmike> loststar4545, try that in recovery mode
[04:51] <loststar4545> i did that it  keeps  pointing to my  onboard gaphics card
[04:51] <Veidit> orbin: sudo apt-get install linux-686
[04:51] <jpjacobs> loststar4545, I experienced the same problem some days ago. the solution was to apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386
[04:52] <jpjacobs> loststar4545, then restart gdm with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[04:52] <orbin> Veidit: what vg card do you have?
[04:52] <loststar4545> cool  uncommenting worked thanks
[04:53] <mnk> how do i install the font for wine?
[04:53] <Veidit> orbin: nvidia quadro N120
[04:53] <roll> yeah xnc does kick ass :D
[04:53] <jpatch> hey, anyone know about configuring a Wireless PCI Adapter?
[04:53] <orbin> Veidit: did you install the binary drivers for that in the 386 install?
[04:53] <Veidit> orbin: This is just an newly installed laptop (Dell 820)
[04:54] <Veidit> orbin: No have not installed anything other then running the upgrade system
[04:54] <orbin> Veidit: try reconfiguring X:
[04:54] <orbin> !xorg
[04:54] <ubotu> I heard xorg is To reconfigure your X server, type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" in a terminal, or check here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto or here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-83973.html
[04:54] <NoUse> !tell jpatch about wireless
[04:54] <Veidit> orbin: I just notices, since I am using Dapper perhaps I should ask in #ubuntu+1 instead
[04:54] <me> orbin: Do you know anything I can do about this error?
[04:55] <jpjacobs> Veidit, I also experienced problems with a nvidia card after updateing recently. The solution was to apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386
[04:55] <orbin> Veidit: i'd do that, yes
[04:55] <orbin> me: sounds like a bad cd if you ask me...did you burn it?
[04:55] <me> orbin: Yep.
[04:56] <orbin> me: apparently bad burns are possible and burning at slower speeds is best.
[04:56] <me> orbin: I may try again. Thanks.

[05:03] <Ng> ramvi: which version of ubuntu are you running?
[05:03] <ramvi> dapper
[05:03] <Ng> ramvi: synaptic can generate a download script for a given set of packages you want to install
[05:03] <ramvi> It's for my friend on the phone. I've got internet obiously ;)
[05:03] <Heath> Hey
[05:03] <Ng> see the File menu

[05:04] <Ng> Heath: see the RestrictedFormats wiki page
[05:04] <ubuntu> DBO: did you get my post about 30-40 minutes ago?
[05:04] <ramvi> Ng, so on a machine with internet he starts the livecd and synaptic
[05:04] <ramvi> and generates network-manager installer
[05:04] <ramvi> burns it and goes to his computer and installs it?
[05:04] <ramvi> That's not easy at all!

[05:07] <AMD64Athlon> yeah i think that is it
[05:07] <phreeza> _mason: Mozilla composer
[05:07] <Heath> _mason: In synaptic go to your preferences and enable all the multivers and universe packages
[05:07] <chowells> _mason: type 'nvu' into google

[05:09] <loststar4545> wats the best  place to  put Video or mp3 files  in ubuntu filesystem
[05:09] <Heath> loststar4545: anywhere you want O.o
[05:09] <njan> loststar4545, either in your home directory on another partition you've mounted to /mnt/something or something off root that makes sense like /storage
[05:09] <njan> loststar4545, if you only have one partition it's fairly redundant, though, just stick it somewhere sensible like your homedir
[05:10] <Heath> loststar4545: mine are all in my /home directory

[05:12] <ahoward> Heath: sudo apt-get install build-essential

[05:27] <nubix> now i can't get into x
[05:27] <Healot> checkout software suspend 2 website for compatible modules
[05:27] <Nailor> oprime: User password should do the trick. The other way around is to edit manually /etc/apt/sources.list (eg. sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list) and remove comments in front of deb-lines where universe and multiverse are loaded. The comments in files describe a lot the content

[05:28] <wims> right after starting my computer gnome gave me an error message telling me that the desktop switcher had crashed, so i ctrl + alt + f1 and did sudo killall gdm, but that caused a kernel panic. When i rebooted the desktop switcher didn't load. Does anybody know what command i need to run to start that desktop switcher ?
[05:29] <ahoward> wims: you should right click on the panel you want the switcher on and click add to panel
[05:29] <loststar4545> i read a article on OS X how all sudo  commands are logged does  ubuntu have the same  feature
[05:29] <per_> so perhaps the conclusion is, that universe is a dangerous path?
[05:29] <mlehrer> multiverse rocks
[05:29] <ahoward> wims: then add a desktop switcher
[05:29] <wims> thanks
[05:29] <ahoward> sure

[05:37] <Heath_> How do I get the newest version of gff?

[05:37] <Raskall> Nailor: I'm thinking of that. I have been devloping a business concept called smubuntu. Selling ubuntu servers and maintenance agreements to small and medium size businesses
[05:37] <Nailor> oprime: There might be a way to fix that somehow, but if nothing is lost, reinstall might be the fastest way.
[05:37] <oprime> ahoward: how can I tell if it's broken?
[05:37] <kane77> Heath_ try.. sudo apt-get gcc
[05:37] <Paradoxx> Raskall: why was it soo nice?
[05:37] <Nailor> Raskall: Virtual servers or just 'regular'?
[05:37] <megaman123> anyone knows how to uninstall ati drivers ??
[05:37] <Heath_> kane77: E: Invalid operation gcc
[05:37] <Raskall> Nailor: one server doing firewall, web-, mail and fil/print-services
[05:38] <ahoward> oprime: try running sudo apt-get update
[05:38] <Raskall> Nailor: regular.
[05:38] <kane77> Heath_ try.. sudo apt-get install gcc
[05:38] <oprime> Nailor: nothing is lost. All data is on separate drives.
[05:38] <Raskall> Nailor: actually I won't sell the physical machines, just the config set and installation.
[05:38] <Heath_> Why can't I install mplayer then it says I have a bad version but gcc installer says I have the newest version?
[05:39] <oprime> ahoward: Returns no error messages nor even asked for a password this time.
[05:39] <Raskall> Nailor: and offer 5 hours support/maintenance per month for about $200-$300.
[05:39] <kane77> Heath_ what version do you have??
[05:39] <Heath_> kane77: how do I check?
[05:39] <Nailor> Raskall: Ah. Still, the problem might be, that small companys don't want to invest money on a server
[05:39] <Heath_> kane77: 4:4.0.3-1
[05:40] <ahoward> oprime: try running sudo apt-get install -f

[05:40] <kane77> Heath_ and what type (K7 or i686...)
[05:40] <Falstius> oprime: can you do apt-cache operations?  like apt-cache search openssh
[05:40] <Paradoxx> Raskall: What made the job so "sweeeeet"?
[05:40] <Heath_> kane77: I'm not sure how to tell that
[05:40] <oprime> ahoward: nothing but a prompt again
[05:41] <Nailor> Raskall: That's true, and at least it can handle everything a firewall needs to do. Sensitive data storage might be a trickier part since you need proper backups etc. for it.
[05:41] <oprime> Falstius: yes, it will do the apt-cache ops.
[05:41] <Raskall> Paradoxx: I have always wanted to work with linux. This job was 100% linux.
[05:41] <kane77> hmmm. try something like sudo apt-get update
[05:41] <ahoward> already did that
[05:41] <Nailor> Raskall: Though, if you have sensitive data you cant lose in any circumstances, you're maybe more willing to put more money in your servers too =p

[05:44] <Falstius> oprime: well, are any of the partitions full.  I don't really expect it, but its easy to check and can cause weird results.

[05:46] <Heath_> kane77: yeah this is taking forever....
[05:46] <InnerFIRE> nailor do you run a business?
[05:46] <Raskall> Nailor: that is virtually impossible here in Norway. Almost all employers have in their contracts that employees are not allowed to work/make money any other place.
[05:46] <kane77> Heath_ what? uninstall??
[05:46] <Raskall> Nailor: :)
[05:46] <Heath_> kane77: no make
[05:46] <Healot> scorp82: if the volume is liste in fstab, then by default, it will be owned by root
[05:47] <Nailor> Raskall: Yeah, same thing in Finland
[05:47] <Vixus> Dapper better run faster than this
[05:47] <scorp82> how can I change the owner?

[05:49] <yukonho> Hi everyone, I have a real newbie question about installing 5.10 on a PC that already has Windows ME --- The partitioner in the installation runs into a problem when it is trying to resize the existing partition.  There's about 25GB free on a 40 GB hd, and I'm only trying to resize the partition to 30GB.  Manually editing the partition table doesn't work either.  Should I try this GParted program I've heard about?
[05:49] <Healot> scorp82: wayy too, it makes the access as world writable
[05:49] <Vixus> rendo: Oh, you mean running games on wine?
[05:49] <Ayabara> Are there mplayer hotkeys for sizing window to half, normal and double size?
[05:49] <Healot> yukonho: yes
[05:49] <scorp82> yep! any ideas?
[05:49] <rendo> Vixus: Yes, I have a few questions about hardware for gaming in linux.
[05:49] <bibe> yukonho : did you defragment the disk?
[05:49] <Healot> yukonho: if you prefer free tools
[05:50] <unfo|jspiro> Heath_: Control+C has always worked fine for me.
[05:50] <Vixus> yukonho: Look for the linux startup disk, or security disk or something.
[05:50] <Heath_> unfo|jspiro: Thank you
[05:50] <yukonho> bibe: Yep, I defragmented it and cleaned it up the best I could
[05:50] <Healot> scorp82: try umask=0022
[05:51] <Falstius> oprime: you could reinstall apt from the deb file.
[05:51] <yukonho> help
[05:51] <yukonho> Vixus: Is the linux startup disk different than the regular install disc?
[05:51] <Vixus> yukonho: It's a seperate disk, project thing ya
[05:51] <bibe> yukonho : it's a FAT32 partition, I guess
[05:52] <oprime> Falstius: Is it worth the knowledge to do this, or am I better off reinstalling and seeing if it fixes the apt and synaptic problems I'm having.
[05:52] <scorp82> and that allows read and execute for everyone but what I wanna do is make changes by myself but nobody else
[05:52] <rendo> Meh, maybe you guys will know.
[05:53] <emililinux> #historia
[05:53] <scorp82> so I'd need to be the owner
[05:53] <rendo> What's the best graphics card manufacturer that offers the best linux support for games?
[05:53] <Frogzoo> rendo: nvidia

[05:53] <rendo> Thanks.
[05:53] <DianWei> Hey: probably a simple question, so I am sorry to have to ask this but, is there a commandline option I can use to load up a program on a different desktop? Specifically, I always have my web browser and x-chat on one; RSS reader, and e-mail on two, work on three, and audio/video on four. I'd like to know so that I could set it up so that gnome automatically launches these spplications on startup in the right desktop, instead of all of th
[05:53] <DianWei> em on the first desktop.
[05:53] <theripper> ok , i get an error when sudo ndiswrappper "on line 135" which is coulnt copy .inf , why would it not be able to copy it ?
[05:53] <Vixus> yukonho: http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
[05:53] <yukonho> bibe: Yep, I don't see why it won't resize it.  I only get a message of "not enough free space for installation," which, after the defragmenting and everything, doesn't make too much sense
[05:53] <yukonho> I'm running off the live CD now, is it safe to use GParted here?
[05:53] <scorp82> I tried in the fstab 'user=username' but it didn't work

[06:09] <TeleCon> Never written a dual layer dvd though.

[06:17] <oprime> Falstius: Right. But here's what occurs... "Couldn't stat source package list http://.archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/.archive.ubuntu.com_dists_breezy_universe_binary-amd64_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
[06:17] <oprime> "
[06:17] <blaze> so when i use vlc, i see the same squares
[06:17] <r0xoR> blaze, hmmm, and you've installed all the proper codecs?
[06:17] <blaze> and.. when i try to change the video driver, that xine is using, to x11, it cannot start at all
[06:17] <blaze> yes, i've installed all the codecs
[06:17] <r0xoR> blaze, btw define movies... do you mean DVDs ?
[06:18] <blaze> no.. xvid
[06:18] <Pupbuntoo> hi, have the repositories for ubuntu 5.10 breezy changed?  my package manager is complaining that they have "moved permanantly"...
[06:18] <loststar4545> if i set a root password  will that change the password i use when doing sudo
[06:18] <r0xoR> ok, that's a DVD ripping format similar to divx no?
[06:18] <blaze> right, it's similar
[06:18] <Falstius> oprime: can you do "ls -lh /var/lib/apt/lists/.archive.ubuntu.com_dists_breezy_universe_binary-amd64_Packages"
[06:18] <r0xoR> !repositories
[06:18] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[06:18] <northcol> Pupbuntoo: I'm getting the same trouble with Dapper (6.06)
[06:18] <r0xoR> Pupbuntoo, try getting the official sources.list and then either apt-get update or refresh in synaptic
[06:19] <corey> yes the resp servers are funked up right now
[06:19] <r0xoR> i have vim7!
[06:19] <r0xoR> :)
[06:19] <blaze> r0xoR, i've told xine to use xshm instead of x11 (the default)
=== phreekbird is now known as phreekbird|afk
[06:19] <blaze> or xv..
[06:19] <ubuntu> loststar4545: sudo usermod -G admin username
[06:19] <Skipster> is ubuntu an x windows system
[06:19] <r0xoR> blaze, ok you still haven't answered my second question
[06:19] <Falstius> oprime: I see your problem.. you need to edit your sources.list and remove the "." before archives :)
[06:19] <StyXman> hi all. where can I discover which network interfaces (the `virtual ones, like eth*, lo, etc) are available? dmesg reports a eth2, but when I try to ifconfig eth2 up, it says the device does not exist
[06:19] <blaze> so.. let me see :) sec.
[06:20] <blaze> i have UniChrome Pro 3D/2D integr. in VIA VN800
[06:20] <r0xoR> blaze, btw i've never gotten that far into configuring xine so i can only guess at what you're doing (but it's an educated guess)
[06:20] <r0xoR> blaze, uhhh... what's that?
[06:20] <blaze> :) ok
[06:20] <blaze> that is my video card
[06:20] <oprime> Falstius: I'll try that, but even then, everything in the lists directory starts with either security or ubuntu, not archive.
[06:20] <blaze> it is integrated
[06:20] <blaze> (laptop)
[06:20] <cbtg2006> any ldap authentication users in here?
[06:20] <r0xoR> you have a via video card? or that's your chipset on your mobo
[06:20] <phreeza> blaze squares sounds lika a codec problem to me though
[06:20] <r0xoR> ahh integrated
[06:20] <r0xoR> k
[06:20] <Pupbuntoo> northcol: it looks like removing "us" from the us.archive.ubuntu.com worked for me
[06:21] <Falstius> oprime: that's because you have a ".archive" instead of "archive" .. the . makes the file hidden :)
[06:21] <blaze> phreeza, what codecs do you suggest?
[06:21] <kmilo> Hi
[06:21] <blaze> phreeza, because i think i've installed all i can get
[06:21] <blaze> :-P
[06:21] <r0xoR> blaze, the xvid codec :)
[06:21] <StyXman> Skipster: ubuntu is a linux distribution that has th x window system in it
[06:21] <r0xoR> blaze, do you know about easyubuntu?
[06:21] <Skipster> ya thanks
[06:21] <blaze> i know
[06:21] <blaze> it can't help me
[06:21] <r0xoR> ok
[06:22] <yukonho> bibe: Does the linux rescue CD have a better partitioner than the 6.06 live cd?
[06:22] <r0xoR> blaze, it kinda sucks anyway :P
[06:22] <blaze> :D
[06:22] <phreeza> blaze: i don't really know, vlc has played everything i've thrown at it so far
[06:22] <Falstius> blaze: xine doesn't play xvid for me very well.  vlc works much more smoothly on my P3.
[06:22] <r0xoR> yukonho, no, not really
[06:22] <northcol> Pupbuntoo: Thanks for that hint
[06:22] <StyXman> yukonho: for partitioner, you could try the gparted live cd
[06:22] <blaze> phreeza, it's playing the video, but with a bad quality in full screen
[06:22] <r0xoR> yukonho, they've both got fdisk, i'm not sure if the rescue cd has cfdisk though
[06:22] <blaze> actually if it is not in full screen ( i mean.. in a small window) i see no squares
[06:22] <blaze> and it's kind of perfect :)
[06:23] <Frogzoo> Falstius: you can allocated more mem to gxine's buffers - playback is MUCH improved
[06:23] <phreeza> blaze is your display using acceleration from the graphics card?
[06:23] <blaze> is there any option that i can set to the player?
[06:23] <oprime> Falstius: I'm using the filebrowser to view the /var/lib/apt/lists directory, and telling it to show hidden files, but still no files starting with archive.
[06:23] <disinterested_pe> im having issues with volume not working from keyboard
[06:23] <r0xoR> blaze, phreeza, sounds like a problem with a non-standard video card to me... but hey, what do i know :P
[06:23] <blaze> phreeza, i don't know..
[06:24] <Pupbuntoo> hrmn, now when i try to "apt-get install gnucash", it says, "Some packages could not be installed... The following packages have unmet dependencies: gnucash: Depends: libgal23 (>= 0.24) but it is not going to be installed
[06:24] <Pupbuntoo>  ..."
[06:24] <r0xoR> blaze, one thing i *do* know for sure is that laptops can be very cranky... esp compared to desktops... when it comes to getting hardware to work
[06:24] <oprime> Falstius: I also su'd to root and did an ls -a and still no files beginning with archive.
[06:24] <blaze> and i don't know why it won't play xv format
[06:24] <Falstius> oprime: still, open up /etc/apt/sources.list (or do it in synaptic) and change "http://.archive.ubuntu.com" to "http://archive.ubuntu.com" .. the important part being removing the . before archive.
[06:24] <r0xoR> iirc, there are zero integrated laptop modems that work with linux
[06:24] <blaze> i mean with xv in the settings
[06:24] <phreeza> r0xoR, blaze could be, especially if the issue only appears when in full screen...
[06:24] <oprime> cd /etc/apt
[06:24] <Frogzoo> !linmodem
[06:24] <ubotu> linmodem is, like, To get started with linmodems (aka winmodems), see http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
[06:25] <loststar4545> what is the keyboard shortcut to force a reboot
[06:25] <blaze> phreeza, yes.. and that's why i want to update my drivers
[06:25] <blaze> and that's what i asked you to help me
[06:25] <blaze> phreeza, this is the drivers site: http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=420&OSID=25&CatID=2580&SubCatID=101
[06:25] <blaze> can you help me install the packages?
[06:26] <oprime> Falstius: I see what your saying. Brain hiccup. I have now changed it so there is no "." between the last / and word archive.
[06:26] <gnomefreak> loststar4545: ctrl+alt+delete  maybe 2 times if one doesnt do it
[06:26] <r0xoR> Frogzoo, it's not just cuz most laptop modems are win-modems... it's cuz of the hardware-interface socket that (iirc) all laptops use for modems
[06:26] <Dr_Willis> Hmm...
[06:26] <r0xoR> some special socket for which no one has coded anything
[06:26] <Dr_Willis> - please take the us. out of your /etc/apt/sources.list      - They are saying just remove the '.us'  on the urls ?
[06:26] <Frogzoo> r0xoR: gotcha - thought there might be a catch
[06:26] <gnomefreak> !us
[06:26] <ubotu> *** News Flash*** The us.archive.ubuntu.com repos seem not to be working please take the us. out of your repos replace it with another country code or leave it without any.
[06:27] <phreeza> blaze did you manage to install them?
[06:27] <theripper> ok , i get an error when sudo ndiswrappper "on line 135" which is coulnt copy .inf , why would it not be able to copy it ?
[06:27] <blaze> no
[06:27] <blaze> that's why i want help
[06:27] <Dr_Willis> please take the us. out   - could be interperted as removing the whole "us" entries.. :P
[06:27] <Falstius> gnomefreak: why don't they just change the dns to reroute us. to the main server?
[06:27] <r0xoR> blaze, have you ever recompiled a kernel before?
[06:27] <phreeza> blaze, sorry if i missed something you said earlier, whats the problem you run into?
[06:27] <gnomefreak> it says us.
[06:27] <blaze> r0xoR, never :)
[06:27] <Jeffrey> how do I uninstall ubuntu
[06:27] <oprime> Falstius: Now the error message still appears, but without the leading "." e.g. "Couldn't stat source package list http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_dists_breezy_universe_binary-amd64_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
[06:27] <oprime> "
[06:27] <jeld> sed -i 's/us\.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:27] <gnomefreak> not sure how else to word it
[06:28] <jeld> that would be
[06:28] <jeld> sudo sed -i 's/us\.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:28] <r0xoR> Jeffrey, install whatever you want instead... it'll erase ubuntu in the process
[06:28] <gnomefreak> ok i will add that ty
[06:28] <blaze> phreeza, the problem appears when i watch movies
[06:28] <r0xoR> Jeffrey, or at least it should give you the option
[06:28] <blaze> i see squares, that i don't see in windows when i use bsplayer
[06:28] <r0xoR> blaze, ok man, you'll need to recompile your kernel to get any non-standard drivers to work
[06:28] <phreeza> blaze i mean when aplying the driver
[06:28] <Falstius> oprime: apt-get update
[06:28] <ubuntu> DBO: i think i  have lost the plot beyond reasonable doubt
[06:28] <blaze> i can't apply the driver :)
[06:28] <phreeza> blaze have you tried compiling it?
[06:28] <blaze> nope
[06:29] <blaze> may you tell me how to accomplish this?
[06:29] <r0xoR> phreeza, would you like to help him recompile or should I/
[06:29] <r0xoR> phreeza, don't need more than one cook in this pot and I've got work to do
[06:29] <r0xoR> ?
[06:29] <phreeza> r0xor, me too have to go in about 30 mins
[06:29] <blaze> huh :)
[06:29] <phreeza> isnt there a wiki entry about that?
[06:29] <r0xoR> heheh, i should go now :P
[06:29] <r0xoR> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelByHandHowto?highlight=%28kernel%29
[06:29] <blaze> i guess it's not the best time
[06:29] <r0xoR> yes there is
[06:30] <r0xoR> blaze, i reccomend doing it the "by hand" method
[06:30] <gnomefreak> !us
[06:30] <blaze> ok :)
[06:30] <ubotu> ***News Flash*** The us.archive.ubuntu.com repos seem not to be working please take the us. out of your repos by typing  sudo sed -i 's/us.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list   inside a terminal.
[06:30] <phreeza> yea blaze check that out the wiki is great
[06:30] <r0xoR> blaze, there's the "ubuntu way" and the "by hand" way... i personally vote for the by hand method
[06:30] <blaze> :) ok, cool
[06:30] <blaze> and.. where should i use
[06:30] <r0xoR> blaze, recompiling your kernel can be a difficult thing to do... there are a few things you should keep in mind while doing it
[06:30] <blaze> the source i've downloaded
[06:30] <blaze> ?
[06:30] <fermi> hello..
[06:30] <blaze> i mean .. the Linux-FBDev-kernel-src_2.6.00.02.tgz file
[06:31] <fermi> any one knows how to switch the input method?
[06:31] <gnomefreak> hmmmmm
[06:31] <Falstius> fermi: did you install scim?
[06:31] <yukonho> When using something like GParted to make a new partition for Ubuntu, do I have to format it or can I leave it as free space and let the installer take care of everything?
[06:31] <fermi> Falstius: yes..
=== beyond is now known as beyond-rango
[06:31] <kvgeorge1> have the apt-get repositories changed??? I keep getting perm moved messages for Breezy
[06:31] <gnomefreak> something didnt turn out right :(
[06:31] <oprime> Falstius: apt-get update did not work. But I think the sources list is what is playing foul. I manually checked the urls listed in there, and found that the whole thing is off. Instead of "http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages" it should be "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/universe/binary-amd64" Or am I going in the completely wrong direction?
[06:31] <r0xoR> http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
[06:32] <fermi> Falstius: and now I am not going to use scim but fcitx
[06:32] <gleesond> whats the deal with dapper? when I installed the updates last night it didn't have the beta symbole
[06:32] <r0xoR> blaze, you want 2.6.16.14 i think
[06:32] <r0xoR> or maybe it's 14.16
[06:32] <Ng> gleesond: #ubuntu+1 for dapper questions
[06:32] <Falstius> fermi: for most things you can right click the input window and select input method .. but it doesn't work with firefox.
[06:32] <gnomefreak> !us
[06:32] <ubotu> ***News Flash*** The us.archive.ubuntu.com repos seem not to be working please take the us. out of your repos by typing  sudo sed -i 's/us.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list   inside a terminal.
[06:32] <Ng> !tell oprime about sources
[06:32] <r0xoR> blaze, important! go read this first! http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html
[06:32] <fermi> hmm.. ok, thank you Falstius
[06:32] <blaze> ok.. last question r0xoR
[06:32] <Ng> oprime: ubotu just messaged you with some links, one of which is for the full official breezy sources
[06:33] <blaze> how am i supposed to install the drivers after i recompile the kernel?
[06:33] <r0xoR> blaze, before you read the ubuntu wiki about how to do it on ubuntu... you should read the howto on how to actually DO it
[06:33] <r0xoR> blaze, so you don't screw anything up
[06:33] <Falstius> oprime: you need "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" instead of "htpp://archive.ubuntu.com"
[06:33] <r0xoR> blaze, that's easy... read the instructions :)
[06:33] <Falstius> the rest of the path is built automagically.
[06:33] <blaze> and.. why i should recompile the kernel?
[06:33] <blaze> to make the drivers work :D ?
[06:33] <gnomefreak> i wonder why ubotu wont use \
[06:33] <r0xoR> blaze, in order to compile kernel modules (which is what a driver is)
[06:34] <blaze> oh.. i see so.. i hope that it's written somewere about them too :D
[06:34] <r0xoR> blaze, you'll need to rebuild yourself a kernel, run it... *and* you'll need the source code so that your drivers can be built against the currently running kernel
[06:34] <r0xoR> blaze, read this: http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html
[06:34] <r0xoR> blaze, it will answer all your questions
[06:34] <blaze> super :) thank you very much
[06:34] <r0xoR> blaze, then read the ubuntu wiki kernel by hand howto
[06:34] <blaze> thank you! :)
[06:34] <r0xoR> blaze, then try it out
[06:34] <blaze> ok :) wish me luck :D
[06:35] <r0xoR> blaze, please read ALL of it before actually TRYING it
[06:35] <r0xoR> blaze, good luck :)
[06:35] <blaze> ok :) 10x :D
[06:35] <yukonho> When using something like GParted to make a new partition for Ubuntu, do I have to format it or can I leave it as free space and let the installer take care of everything?
[06:35] <r0xoR> oh blaze
[06:35] <r0xoR> 1 mor thn
[06:35] <Dr_Willis> yukonho,  leave it unallocated. and let the installer handle it.
[06:35] <r0xoR> blaze, when you do get around to actually configuring your kernel
[06:36] <r0xoR> blaze, just say my name on this channel
[06:36] <r0xoR> blaze, i'll come help you configure your kernel
[06:36] <blaze> ok, cool :)
[06:36] <r0xoR> blaze, compiling it is easy... configuring it is hard
[06:36] <yukonho> Dr_Willis: Should I let the installer create the swap partition as well?  My initual problem was that it was not letting me resize the FAT32 Partition
[06:36] <blaze> ok :)
[06:36] <oprime> Falstius: That did it. I wonder why the sources list had incorrect links? It was missing the /ubuntu after .com in most of the sources.
[06:36] <gnomefreak> !us
[06:36] <ubotu> ***News Flash*** The us.archive.ubuntu.com repos seem not to be working please take the us. out of your repos by typing "sudo sed -i 's/us.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list" inside a terminal. dont use the " "
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> yukonho,  resize the partitions.. leave a large section UNALLOCATED - then the installer can see and partition/format the unallocated space as needed. is easiest way
[06:37] <oprime> ubotu: thank you also, you gave me something to compare my sources list with.
[06:37] <ubotu> oprime: pas de quoi
[06:37] <yukonho> Dr_Willis:  Alright, I'll give it a go.  Thanks so much!
[06:37] <oprime> ubotu: Is that French?
[06:37] <ubotu> Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, oprime
[06:38] <Mindy> okay, are the repositories down for x86? because I keep getting 301 "moved permanetly"

[06:39] <jdh> what?? has Dapper really been canceled?? is this real?? it says it on Slashdot!
[06:40] <Falstius> oprime: I figured you deleted it :)  Glad its working.
[06:40] <Znuff> Hello. I've got a small issue. I've got the cd iso of ubuntu and I'm trying to burn it on a dvd (I'm out of cds), and all burning software ask me for a cd =/
[06:40] <Dr_Willis> Znuff,  ya could download the dvd version.
[06:40] <Jeffrey> exit
[06:40] <Znuff> Dr_Willis, I just spent hours downloading this...
[06:40] <ompaul> jdh, show me an announcement on a ubuntu mailing list
[06:40] <jdh> what is a mailing list
[06:41] <gnomefreak> jdh: dapper has not been cancelled
[06:41] <ompaul> jdh, (don't waste your time looking there is no announcement)
[06:41] <oprime> Falstius: Nope, just installed last night, and hadn't deleted anything. I didn't even know about the sources.list until you mentioned it. I wonder why it was missing.
[06:41] <Dr_Willis> Znuff,  ive heard people ask similer cd on dvd.. bedor.. and never seen any way to do it.
[06:41] <Znuff> Dr_Willis, and there's no dvd image for ubuntu 6.06 beta2 =/
[06:41] <bthornton> Got a networking question; hope it's okay to ask here...
[06:41] <Manika> where did they get that? dapper cancelled... c'mon!
[06:41] <oprime> Falstius: (the /ubuntu,  not the whole file)
[06:41] <gnomefreak> jdh: we will know before any website would im sure of it
[06:41] <bthornton> Say I've got a 4-port hub/switch with hosts "A", "B", "C", and "D" connected.  Hosts "A" and "B" are on the 192.168.1.x subnet and hosts "C" and "D" are on the 192.168.2.x subnet.  Is there anything wrong with having these two subnets running through the same hub/switch, or do I need to have a separate hub/switch?
[06:41] <Dr_Willis> Znuff,  i thogh i saw one in the daily builds - or the live cd-dvd was what i saw
[06:41] <doped1> i've read something about, it is possible to apt-get dapper distro, when released in non beta?
[06:42] <lullabud> bthornton: you should be fine.
[06:42] <Znuff> Dr_Willis, found this, http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?t=143236, on google... but I'd like a little bit more info, as this is the only dvd I have left :P
[06:42] <jdh> I hope you are right
[06:42] <kmilo> jdh, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_list
[06:42] <Mindy> this is screwed up, I changed my repositories from CA to US (which im told is down) and it works >_<
[06:42] <Dr_Willis> Znuff,  i think its time tobe going to the store. :P
[06:42] <lullabud> bthornton: that's actually a common thing to do.
[06:42] <Znuff> Dr_Willis, too far, no way :>
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> Znuff,  guess it sucks to be you.
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> get some milk and bread while you are out. :)
[06:43] <bthornton> Awesome.  Okay, followup question: In general, hosts on either subnet are going to be unable to talk to hosts on the other subnet, correct?  If I want them to be able to talk to each other, how (briefly) do I do that?  i.e. will I need to setup a gateway?
[06:43] <aaron> dapper is cancelled :(
[06:43] <doped1> shure?
[06:43] <doped1> sure*
[06:43] <blaze> r0xoR, i have another question before i continue with the recompiling thing
[06:43] <blaze> and the things i have to read
[06:43] <Chousuke> aaron: Where does it say so?
[06:44] <blaze> what should be the size of the swapping partition?

[06:44] <Dr_Willis> blaze,  i set mine to 512mb or so
[06:44] <batman> does anyone know of a way i can sym link the home dir to a different hard drive?
[06:44] <lullabud> bthornton: you can open up your subnet mask to 255.255.0.0...
[06:44] <Dr_Willis> blaze,  more if you dont have much ram
[06:44] <blaze> i have 512 ram
[06:44] <batman> when i mount the hard drive as home i can't set this progam up correctly
[06:44] <jdh> that's what I read too
[06:44] <blaze> so how much that makes :) ?
[06:44] <lullabud> bthornton: you could install routing software on one of the hosts and set it up with an additional interface on the same ethernet card...
[06:44] <Dr_Willis> blaze,  id say 1gb or so then.
[06:44] <LinuxJones> Dapper is canceled wtf ?
[06:44] <lullabud> bthornton: you could set static routes in the hosts routing tables...
[06:44] <blaze> and.. if i want to enlarge it.. what should i do?
[06:44] <Pupbuntoo> is there a way to find out what package to install to get the program "gnome-config"?
[06:44] <jdh> this sucks
[06:45] <DbD-> batman, see the /etc/fstab
[06:45] <Howdy125> Whats with this in apt ? .. http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz: 301 Moved Permanently
[06:45] <LinuxJones> post the link
[06:45] <batman> DbD- read my last statement
[06:45] <jdh> Howdy125: they canceled dapper
[06:45] <blaze> Dr_Willis, ?
[06:45] <lullabud> bthornton: why do you need them in different subnets?
[06:45] <Howdy125> ha ha jdh
[06:45] <RandolphCarter> :p jdh
[06:45] <DbD-> blaze, 512 Mo of swap it's ok
[06:45] <bthornton> lullabud: hm, okay.  In reality, I would like all hosts to be able to communicate with e/o as though they were on the same subnet, so that begs the question... ya the question you just asked :)
[06:45] <blaze> DbD-, ok, but how to enlarge mine?
[06:45] <lullabud> Howdy125: looking at the output of curl, it shows that the bandwidth limit on that mirror has been exceeded.
[06:45] <gnomefreak> LinuxJones: dapper has not been canceled and please take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
[06:46] <LinuxJones> jdh, post the link to bastebin
[06:46] <Howdy125> ok lullabud
[06:46] <LinuxJones> gnomefreak, sorry I thought this was OT sorry
[06:46] <jdh> what is pastebin
[06:46] <lullabud> bthornton: i'd just put them on the same subnet either by widening your mask to 255.255.0.0 or by putting them both in 192.168.1.x
[06:46] <cubikdice> lol
[06:46] <sharms> LinuxJones - read the title
[06:46] <Dr_Willis> blaze,  enlarge it later? proberly wont ever need to.
[06:46] <bthornton> lullabud: I want a second subnet because I've got a small network here that I'm "merging" with another small network and want each host to keep its own respective name without reassigning IP addresses (since many of the host IPs overlap).
[06:46] <doped1> what is too expect from dapper that breezy doesn't?
[06:46] <sharms> LinuxJones, - just the resp are not working
[06:46] <aaron> i have to go
[06:47] <bthornton> lullabud: I've always used the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 -- how does 255.255.0.0 "widen" it?
[06:47] <lullabud> bthornton: i don't quite follow...
=== greg_ is now known as gmhikin03_
[06:48] <blaze> does anyone know what should i do to enlarge my swap partition?
[06:48] <sharms> bthornton - it is a MASK that is applied over the address.  So 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 means 192.168.1.1-255     192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 means 192.168.1-255.1-255
[06:48] <amphi> blaze: if you have unpartitioned space, you can make a second swap partition
[06:48] <bthornton> ahhh
[06:48] <bthornton> I gotcha
[06:48] <amphi> blaze: you can also use a swap file
[06:48] <sharms> or 0-254 rather :)_
[06:49] <bthornton> coulda fooled me
[06:49] <blaze> ok amphi, 10x
[06:49] <Howdy125> Nice not seeing "Beta" on my desktop anymore .. :)
=== nalioth_zZz is now known as noirequus
[06:49] <lullabud> bthornton: basically, the mask is the number of bits that are in the network address.  255.255.255.0 is 24 bits, leaving 8 bits for hosts.  255.255.0.0 is 16 bits, leaving 16 bits for hosts.
[06:50] <amphi> blaze: why do you need more? how much ram and swap do you have now?
[06:50] <blaze> i have 512 ram and 213 mb swap
[06:50] <lullabud> and since 192.168.2.x and 192.168.1.x both have the same first 16 bits, they are now within the same 255.255.0.0 subnet.
[06:50] <blaze> i'm a newbie after all :)
[06:50] <jesse-jads> has people been having problems downloading from repository today http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/restricted/binary-i386/Packages.gz
[06:50] <amphi> blaze: why did you make so little?
[06:50] <amphi> blaze: swap?
[06:51] <Larsson-Sweden> Does anyone know how to play videos in fbxine or aaxine? It just says "Video port failed"
[06:51] <blaze> because i thought it won't matter :D
[06:51] <blaze> but it's working kind of slow now ;)
[06:51] <amphi> blaze: are you actually having problems because of this?
[06:51] <lullabud> jesse-jads: yes.  the bandwidth limit has been exceeded.
[06:51] <blaze> a little :)
[06:51] <jesse-jads> Yeah that sucks
[06:51] <dell500> how do you find out what version of kde is installed?
[06:51] <amphi> blaze: and why do you think it's swap?
[06:51] <kuitang> something like konqueror --version
[06:51] <tristanmike> blaze, swap should be twice the ram
[06:52] <blaze> i suppose.. because when i open a web page with more flash it's working very slow
[06:52] <ompaul> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ get a mailing list and stay up today - slashdot is for those who don't know :)
[06:52] <amphi> blaze: more swap can make it faster, as unused stuff can be paged out, letting more files be cached in RAM
[06:52] <blaze> tristanmike, i heard that from a friend a day ago
[06:52] <Ignite> i seem to have lost jpeg support in Kubuntu, i can't set my desktop background as a jpeg and in konqueror its just a blank (transparent) icon, does anyone know what package i will need to (re)install?
[06:52] <bthornton> lullabut: ok I see now.  Well the answer to your question about having multiple subnets is really that I should just merge into the same subnet, but I want to go ahead and try two so that I can learn how to do some beginner/intermediate routing and finally tackle that dreaded ROUTING-HOWTO I've been avoiding for so long. :p
[06:52] <blaze> ok amphi :)
[06:52] <Syco54645> crap i just had a brain fart.  where is the mount information kept.
[06:52] <amphi> blaze: you don't need a gb of swap - 2x ram is from the olden days
[06:52] <bthornton> lullabud: so thanks for the info, that should be enough to get me started
[06:52] <blaze> =D
[06:53] <ompaul> Syco54645, mount and /etc/fstab
[06:53] <Syco54645> is it mtab or fstab
[06:53] <Syco54645> ompaul: thanks
[06:53] <kuitang> fstab
[06:53] <amphi> blaze: if you were actually using 1GB of swap with 512MB ram, the machine would not be pleasant to use
[06:53] <blaze> :) i see
[06:53] <Syco54645> so if i want to be able to have a normal user mount and unmount iso images, what would i put in the fstab
[06:53] <amphi> Syco54645: generally, you shouldn't edit /etc/mtab
[06:54] <Syco54645> amphi: yeah i noticed that after a cat.  thanks though
[06:54] <amphi> blaze: but a bit more wouldn't do you any harm ;)
[06:54] <amphi> blaze: do you have unpartitioned space?
[06:54] <der0b> where would I go to see how much video memory I have?
[06:54] <blaze> :D 10x for the detailed explanation, i'll make :D
[06:55] <blaze> i am wondering to remove winXP or not.. :)
[06:55] <blaze> :D
[06:55] <blaze> but i'll think again
[06:55] <kuitang> go ahead

[06:56] <Mortuis> Does anyone know about SSH and pgp?  I need some help getting this to work on the command line.
[06:56] <amphi> blaze: you can make a swap file - use dd to make a file of the desired size somewhere, mkswap it, and swapon it
[06:56] <Larsson-Sweden> Does anyone know how to play videos in fbxine or aaxine? It just says "Video port failed"

[06:57] <ubotu> it has been said that gpg is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto or http://www.linuxgazette.com/node/8746
[06:57] <miter> any Xubuntu users? How to have "Synaptic" in xfce?
[06:57] <Ignite> aLPHa_LeaK, thanks i'll try
[06:57] <kuitang> mortius: delete ur gpg directory
[06:57] <Mortuis> kuitang: I have the key, and have gotten in using it with a windows client.  But I don't know how to point linux to the key.
[06:57] <aLPHa_LeaK> Ignite, try apt-cache search libjpeg* could be that im wrong
[06:57] <kuitang> there's a command to import keys
[06:57] <kuitang> man gpg
[06:57] <ketsugi> voraistos: Nope. I managed to get Evolution syncing the calendar and contacts with the ppc, but it seemed to be only one way
[06:57] <Mortuis> kuitang: thanks
[06:57] <ketsugi> and it was a pain to deal with
[06:58] <chrisbudden14> hey
[06:58] <Ignite> aLPHa_LeaK, i have already installed a lot of jpeg related packages with no luck, i've just done apt-get install libjpeg* now, going to see what happens :)
[06:58] <amphi> blaze: dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/swapfile bs=1M count=512 would make a 512MB file
[06:58] <chrisbudden14> hi
[06:58] <Ignite> aLPHa_LeaK, no luck, thanks anyway
[06:58] <miter> and: how to SEARCH the apt-repos with command line?
[06:58] <blaze> amphi, ok, i'll type it
[06:58] <amphi> blaze: I've never used a swap file myself, so I'd be interested in how you get on
[06:59] <blaze> =)
[06:59] <blaze> cool :)
[06:59] <Ignite> miter, apt-cache search <whatever>
[06:59] <amphi> blaze: replace '/path/to/swapfile' with something sensible, obviously
[06:59] <batman> can someone please tell me how i can "sym link" my home dir to a different hard drive without mounting it?
[06:59] <Falstius> miter: you can do a search on a few words too, it doesn't have to be a single word.
[06:59] <chrisbudden14> are the forums down?
[07:00] <voraistos> ketsugi: yea that sucks, there is just no way (unless by email) to send a damn .cab install soft on the ppc

[07:00] <Ignite> hrm.. when i try opening a jpeg in gwenview i get "Could not find mime type

[07:00] <kuitang> file FILE.jpg
[07:01] <kuitang> make sure it didn't get corrupted; if it is a jpeg, it should print something saying it's a jpeg
[07:01] <gnomefreak> no forums are not down
[07:01] <aLPHa_LeaK> Ignite, it might be libjpg
[07:01] <chrisbudden14> yea gnomefreak, im running dapper, and im having a screen saver problem.  Ive set the screen saver, and in gnome-power-manager ive set the display to sleep never but instead of the screensaver i get a black scree
[07:01] <Ignite> kuitang, ok
[07:01] <blaze> amphi, i've made it
[07:01] <Ignite> aLPHa_LeaK, ok i will do a search
[07:02] <gnomefreak> chrisbudden14: join #ubuntu+1 they might beable to help you better
[07:02] <amphi> blaze: cool; now do mkswap /path/to/swapfile

[07:04] <lullabud> awesome, the bandwidth limit exceed has been fixed!

[07:04] <lullabud> dapper is no longer canceled!
[07:04] <lullabud> :P
[07:04] <amphi> blaze: cat /proc/swaps should show it then; if so, run top, and you should see you have ~700MB swap
[07:04] <gnomefreak> lullabud: it never was and please talk about that in #ubuntu-offtopic
[07:05] <blaze> ok, it appeared amphi
[07:05] <blaze> :)
[07:05] <lullabud> gnomefreak: but... i don't want to talk about it.
[07:05] <blaze> thak you very much :)
[07:05] <amphi> blaze: you see it in top?
[07:05] <lullabud> gnomefreak: and that's not off-topic.  i came in here looking for a fix for that problem, and now it's fixed.
[07:05] <voraistos> lool
[07:05] <lullabud> gnomefreak: other people had it, and i told them the source of the problem, and now i'm announcing the solution.  it's hardly off-topic.
[07:05] <blaze> amphi, yes, Swap:   805376k total,
[07:05] <gnomefreak> lullabud: yes it is this is not a dapper channel this channel is only for breezy and hoary
[07:05] <blaze> :) cool :-P
[07:06] <lullabud> gnomefreak: so, wouldn't my comments belong in #ubuntu+1 ?
[07:06] <blaze> i'll write down what we've done so far :), 10x again
[07:06] <B1zz> it is? what channel is dapper?
[07:06] <tristanmike> #ubuntu+1
[07:06] <B1zz> okies ty
[07:06] <gnomefreak> lullabud: not really since its a false statement and its not support related
[07:07] <amphi> blaze: you may be able to put an entry in /etc/fstab for that
[07:07] <lullabud> gnomefreak: that's ridiculous.  it is totally support related.  i came in here, the official support channel, looking for a fix for that problem.
[07:07] <amphi> blaze: from now on, you only need do swapon /path/to/swapfile to 'enable' it
[07:07] <lullabud> gnomefreak: besides, it's over.  talking about it is moot.
[07:07] <loststar4545> whats the difference between sudo apt-get update  and upgrade
[07:07] <Ignite> does anybosy know of a program that will allow me to change QT themes like gtk-chtheme does for GTK? i'm going to install ubuntu but can't live without amarok :P
[07:07] <amphi> blaze: you only need dd and mkswap if you want to make another one
[07:07] <blaze> i see..
[07:08] <lullabud> loststar4545: update will update the list of packages.  upgrade actually does the upgrade of the packages.
[07:08] <blaze> so when i need more memory, i swap it on :)
[07:08] <tristanmike> loststar4545, update makes note of changes, upgrade applies them
[07:08] <gnomefreak> lullabud: dapper was never canceled nor will it be and as for it being or not is _not_ support related it does not affect you version of ubuntu in any way
[07:08] <Mortuis> I'm having a problem importing an encryption key. It looks like I need to install OpenPGP or something, but I see nothing called OpenPGP in apt-cache.  Could anyone take a look? http://pastebin.com/733268
[07:08] <lullabud> gnomefreak: when i can't successfully update my list of packages, it's support related.
[07:08] <amphi> blaze: dd is to create the file of the required size, and mkswap 'formats' it for use as a swap file
[07:08] <blaze> or fstab as you said (i missed it)
[07:08] <kuitang> not openpgp; gpg
[07:08] <gnomefreak> lullabud: those are the repos
[07:08] <gnomefreak> !us
[07:08] <ubotu> **NB** The US Archives are having frequent issues, remove the "us" out of your  sources.list by typing >> sudo sed -i 's/us\.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list <<in a terminal (Menu applications accessories terminal)
[07:08] <gnomefreak> ^^^ thats why you cant has nothing to do with dapper
[07:08] <blaze> i got it all, thank you :)
[07:09] <gnomefreak> same happens with breezy ;)
[07:09] <gnomefreak> now to continue this move it to #ubuntu-offtopic (the part with dapper being cancelled)
[07:10] <lullabud> lol
[07:10] <gnomefreak> as for support with dapper take it to #ubuntu+1
[07:10] <voraistos> lullabud: u might not use the .us repos, and have problems with it anyway...

[07:11] <amphi> blaze: I don't know if adding an entry to fstab will work; you could copy the current swap entry, and change /dev/foo to /path/to/swapfile and see if that works; at worst, it won't work, it won't break anthing

[07:21] <mjcs> isn't that down to what filesystem you use?
[07:21] <NoUse> FeestBijtje why are you trying to umount all your drives?
[07:21] <Falstius> loststar4545: you can do that with either slocate (very simple, name based) or beagle in dapper.
[07:21] <amphi> miter: gnumeric perhaps - abiword is just a wp AFAIK, noy part of a 'suite' (ugh)
[07:21] <Warbo> loststar4545: Do you mean for searching? Beagle does
[07:21] <FeestBijtje> NoUse, couse i want to mount an NTFS drive for copying some data to it
[07:22] <loststar4545> yeah for searching  faster
[07:22] <NoUse> FeestBijtje so just umount that drive, you can't umount all drives while the system is running
[07:22] <Warbo> loststar4545: Use Beagle, it's really fast
[07:22] <mjcs> idd. beagle's actually awesome
[07:22] <FeestBijtje> sudo modprobe fuse && sudo umount -a && sudo mount -a
[07:23] <NoUse> FeestBijtje umount -a unmount all drives, that won't work
[07:23] <FeestBijtje> NoUse, so how do i mount hdb1 with read/write permissions
[07:23] <FeestBijtje> last time this all worked out
[07:24] <amphi> FeestBijtje: you can't unmount /
[07:24] <NoUse> FeestBijtje NTFS write support isn't safe so I don't know
[07:24] <FeestBijtje> NoUse, i know but i must to
[07:24] <FeestBijtje> i must write to it*
[07:24] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[07:24] <NoUse> FeestBijtje you realize you might delete all your data?
[07:24] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: you can just sudo mount -o remount,rw /dev/hdb1
[07:24] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[07:25] <Warbo> FeestBijtje: I think NTFS write support is supposed to be safe, but to keep it safe it frequently aborts
[07:25] <tuxtheslacker> can someone tell me how the ipw2200 drivers work for ubuntu?
[07:25] <tuxtheslacker> or if the ipw2200 nics work out of the box with ubuntu?
[07:25] <Falstius> ls
[07:25] <Falstius> oops :)
[07:25] <dizz1> YES! DAPPER IS RELEASED!
[07:25] <NoUse> dizz1 no its not
[07:25] <FeestBijtje> Falstius, that dousnt work
[07:26] <FeestBijtje> dizz1, what did you say?
[07:26] <dizz1> not official, but released
[07:26] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/ipw2200?highlight=%28ipw2200%29
[07:26] <tuxtheslacker> anyone able to tell me about the ipw2200 drivers?
[07:26] <Warbo> dizz1: Yes, it has been for ages (not final)
[07:26] <tuxtheslacker> mjcs, thanks.
[07:26] <dizz1> i cant see the BETA splash screen anymore
[07:26] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: I've never used the "fuse" drivers .. maybe you have to umount it completely (umount /dev/hdb1)
[07:26] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker:  hah actually theres barely anything on that page
[07:26] <NoUse> dizz1 its a RC
[07:26] <NoUse> dizz1 not a release
[07:27] <dizz1> are you sure?
[07:27] <FeestBijtje> feestbijtje@ubuntu:~$ umount /dev/hdb1
[07:27] <FeestBijtje> umount: /dev/hdb1 is not mounted (according to mtab)
[07:27] <tuxtheslacker> mjcs, there's nothing on that page.
[07:27] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: then mount it read-write :)
[07:27] <NoUse> dizz1 do you think they would release dapper without a RC?
[07:27] <Warbo> dizz1: Actually, I only saw the work in progress artwork when I ran a livecd onece. I just upgraded my breezy to dapper and I kept all of my preferences (custom splash, etc.)
[07:27] <tuxtheslacker> I'm on fedora right now, and it's kinda bloated. I've been on slack for a year, and before that I was on gentoo.
[07:27] <NoUse> dizz1 also, its not listed here: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/
[07:27] <FeestBijtje> Falstius, how
[07:27] <tuxtheslacker> do you think ubuntu would be a good choice?
[07:27] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker: i saw loads somewhere about getting it working. i just can't remember where.
[07:28] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker:  sorry!
[07:28] <tuxtheslacker> mjcs, there's lots on getting it working, it's just a thing of if it's easy to make work on ubuntu :-P
[07:28] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: if you have ntfs read-write support, sudo mount -o rw /dev/hdb1 /windows
[07:28] <loststar4545> how do i find out what version of ubuntu i am using
[07:28] <NoUse> loststar4545 lsb_release -a
[07:28] <Falstius> but I've never bothered with ntfs write support so can't tell you how to set that up.
[07:28] <LinuxJones> loststar4545, cat /etc/issue
[07:29] <Warbo> To mount FUSE filesystems don't you use ./filesystem ?
[07:29] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker: my wireless card worked out of the box on both my computer and my laptop on Dapper. it should be easy..
[07:29] <dizz1> well, i think it is not enough time to develop DAPPER anymor
[07:29] <tuxtheslacker> mjcs, normally it needs the firmware at least updated.
[07:29] <tuxtheslacker> or at least did in fedora.
[07:29] <dizz1> therefore it can be a release
[07:29] <NoUse> dizz1 well a week is plenty of time to fix bugs
[07:29] <tuxtheslacker> in slack it was a huge pain in the testicles.
[07:29] <L33TrDaNu> is there a way to rip mp3s from a flash audio player?
[07:29] <NoUse> dizz1 its a release candiate, not a release
[07:30] <dizz1> OK!
[07:30] <Warbo> L33TrDaNu: Mount it (plug it in)
[07:30] <dizz1> NoUse: OK!
[07:30] <LinuxJones> tuxtheslacker, you can do a server install (no X) then do custom install using apt whether you want to use kde, gnome, xfce4 whatever.
[07:30] <L33TrDaNu> Warbo: i do not follow
[07:30] <L33TrDaNu> Warbo: not a usb flash drive
[07:30] <L33TrDaNu> Warbo: a swf-based flash player
[07:30] <FeestBijtje> Falstius, i mounted it trough fstab
[07:31] <mjcs> tuxtheslacker: i done a quick search of the forums, it appears the ipw2200 should work out of the box on Dapper. should be painless.
[07:31] <tuxtheslacker> linuxboy, that's what I had planned on doing, but bassically, I need wireless support.
[07:31] <Warbo> L33TrDaNu: Oh, sorry I thought you meant a flash based (NAND memory) usb MP3 Player :)

[07:31] <jorgg> how can I controll the sound volume when there is flashanimation with sound in mozilla? Even though Ive turn down the sound volume in gnome the flash sound is very high!
[07:31] <Tomcat_> Bit offtopic, but will WinXP delete my Linux partitions on installation?
[07:31] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: so just mount /media/hdb1
[07:32] <Falstius> Tomcat_: depending on how your drive is set up, it might just refuse to install without deleting them.
[07:32] <Warbo> L33TrDaNu: You can get stuff like that for windoze, and they are probably simple enough to run well in WINE
[07:32] <Falstius> Tomcat_: but it won't do it automatically.

[07:33] <L33TrDaNu> ok, will check it out, thx
[07:34] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: "sudo mount /mnt/hdb1"  it will get the settings from fstab

[07:36] <Okay> hi
[07:36] <jhenn> hi. can someone help me get my X fixed?
[07:37] <Warbo> Does the Dapper Live/Install CD actually come with many packages? (I am thinking eagle-usb, as I often need that to get on the net in the first place)
[07:37] <Okay> Cisco Wifi card works with Ubuntu?
[07:37] <Warbo> jhenn: What is the matter?
[07:37] <jhenn> Warbo, it lags and stuff
[07:38] <jhenn> Warbo, while moving windows
[07:38] <Newbify2> Okay: if you can't find native linux drivers try ndiswrapper
[07:38] <jhenn> Warbo, hard to explain
[07:38] <Warbo> jhenn: Do you need to install a binary driver or something?

[07:39] <Warbo> jhenn: Oh right. Well, the only solution I have for lagging/sticking windows when moving is XGL, but I doubt that would help :)
[07:39] <mjcs> jhenn: but Linuxant's Driverloader is gods gift
[07:40] <Okay> and another question, Call manager exist in free version?
[07:40] <Warbo> GaiaX11: Look for "linux-image-something" packages, and get rid of the older ones
[07:40] <loststar4545> whats the locatio of the trash folder
[07:41] <jhenn> Warbo, i think i just want to turn off showing windows while moving them and that would satisfy.  do you know how to do this in metacity?
[07:41] <Warbo> loststar4545: $HOME/.Trash and any other drive/partition's root/.Trash-username

[07:41] <Warbo> GaiaX11: Yes, but don't get rid of the latest one (the one you are using)
[07:41] <mjcs> Ooh does anyone know of a tool that can resize NTFS partitions in Linux?
[07:42] <Newbify2> Mortal`: sudo -s should give you a root shell
[07:42] <Mortal`> Thanks

[07:59] <NoUse> Znuff ok

[07:59] <cbtg2006> anyone familiar with pam_ldap?
[08:00] <tristanmike> Syco54645, using "sudo" with graphical apps can have a problem when it overwrites configuration files. "gksudo or gksu" are strictly for graphical apps
[08:00] <Warbo> tristanmike: That's why I use sudo -s -H to get config files in /root
[08:00] <tristanmike> Syco54645, and in Kubuntu it's "kdesu"

[08:01] <tristanmike> Warbo, yeah, but you don't want to start a graphical app with "sudo" and have it overwrite something
[08:01] <cubikdice> Warbo, for the linux-restricted-modules what one do i uninstall
[08:01] <Syco54645> tristanmike: would that fix my problem then?
[08:01] <Warbo> cubikdice: Whichever you have installed (as long as you don't need it's wifi drivers or anything)
[08:02] <cubikdice> Warbo, linux-restricted-modules-386 or the 686 one or linux-restricted-modules-common? or the ones with the kernel versions in them

[08:02] <tristanmike> Syco54645, your DVD's must be the equal speed of your drive too, if you have a 9,000,000 x burner and a 1x DVD, it's still only going to burn at 1x

[08:03] <Syco54645> tristanmike: well they are 12x dvds but i cant even put it to 12.  i can do 6 max, and it burns only at like 3x that way
[08:03] <Desh> Log off means you can log in as a diff user. Restart means you reboot the PC. o_O
[08:03] <Davey`> loststar4545: the formet sends you back to the GDM login screen, the other restarts the entire PC
[08:03] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright here i go
[08:03] <Warbo> loststar4545: Log off sends you to the log in screen (or the previously logged in user if more than one is logged in) while restart will turn your computer off and on
[08:04] <mirak> does anyone noticed that xchat crashes when you are kicked ?
[08:04] <Warbo> mirak: I noticed that XChat crashes when it starts. I started using GAIM :)
[08:04] <tristanmike> Syco54645, did you run the "k3b setup" ?
=== waky|off is now known as waky
[08:05] <Znuff> another question... is there the real xchat client in ubuntu? not xchat-gnome ? =/
[08:05] <thetallest> hello
[08:06] <Warbo> hello
[08:06] <gdb> Znuff: That *is* the real xchat.
[08:06] <Znuff> that's xchat-gnome, don't like it
=== waky is now known as waky|off
[08:06] <gdb> Then you don't like xchat!
[08:06] <Znuff> I've been an xchat user for the last 4 years
=== waky|off is now known as waky

[08:08] <cubik> Warbo: well i'm in irssi right now, and got 2 errors. 1) i got GCC 4.0 and aperantly thats a no no. 2) i dont have my kernel sources or something (cuz it couldnt find a matching kernel or something) now what?
[08:08] <Warbo> cubik: The kernel sources is fixed with linux-headers package
[08:08] <thetallest> I'm real new to the whole linux thing and need a little help
[08:09] <cubik> Warbo, as for the compiler?
[08:09] <kane77> thetallest what help??
[08:09] <Warbo> cubik: Maybe install gcc-3.4 package (you can have multiple installed) and "sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/gcc-3.4 /usr/bin/gcc"
[08:09] <tristanmike> thetallest, sure, just fire away
[08:09] <mjcs> thetallest: just ask your question, if someone can help, they'll answer
[08:09] <HymnToLife> !justask
[08:09] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[08:10] <cubik> Warbo: alright i'll have another go
[08:10] <Syco54645>  yay k3b is done compiling... finally
[08:10] <chaz_> Hey ppl
[08:10] <thetallest> I'm a windows type and I'm lost with installing apps
[08:10] <tristanmike> !tell thetallest about synaptic
[08:10] <chaz_> Does anyone know where abouts Gaim is installed?
[08:10] <HymnToLife> !apt
[08:10] <ubotu> I guess apt is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptGetHowTo/ or http://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#apt-howto
[08:10] <tristanmike> !tell thetallest about universe
[08:10] <thetallest> I'm trying to install crownandcutlass but it's not doing what it should
[08:10] <Warbo> thetallest: 1) You don't need to download stuff from possibly untrustwaorth websites
[08:10] <thetallest> stew@Linux:~/Desktop/stuff/cc/CrownCutlass$ make
[08:10] <thetallest> make: sdl-config: Command not found

[08:10] <Warbo> !paste
[08:10] <ubotu> see <!pastebin> please
[08:11] <ompaul> chaz_, It is here /usr/bin/gaim but I guess that is not what you want
[08:11] <Warbo> !pastebin
[08:11] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[08:11] <mjcs> thetallest: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[08:11] <chaz_> ompaul, i need to find where abouts to install themese for it lol
[08:11] <Warbo> thetallest: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[08:11] <mjcs> then use synaptic to find SDL
[08:11] <thetallest> what does that do?
[08:11] <ompaul> thetallest, Please Do No Paste In This Channel  Thank You  ;-)
[08:11] <bobulooo> how do I update the dhcp configuration of a network interface from the command line?  In gentoo, I'd use dhcpcd ...
[08:11] <Warbo> thetallest: It installs the programs needed to build source code into programs
[08:11] <Asathoor> anyone here using Palm Pilot / Gnome?
[08:12] <tristanmike> thetallest, build-essential are a group of important compiling programs, not all of them, but the most important
[08:12] <thetallest> sorry about that ompaul
[08:12] <ompaul> thetallest, k
[08:12] <mjcs> bobulooo: no different in ubuntu..
[08:12] <thetallest> ok, gotcha
[08:13] <chaz_> ompaul, do you know where for example, the plugins folder is located please?
[08:13] <ompaul> chaz_, have a look in here:
[08:13] <chaz_> o ok
[08:13] <ompaul> chaz_, have a look in here: /usr/share/doc/gaim-data
[08:13] <chaz_> chers :)
[08:13] <chaz_> cheers*
[08:13] <Warbo> chaz_: Most needed files are in /usr/lib/programname
[08:13] <chaz_> oky doky thanks :)
[08:13] <chaz_> im not as much as a newbie as i was but im still learning, hehe :)
[08:13] <thetallest> cheers for that warbo and tristanmike
[08:14] <thetallest> I'm very much still at the "it's doing stuff W00T" stage
[08:14] <ompaul> thetallest, you never ever loose that one :)
[08:14] <cubik> Warbo: alright one error down, 1 to go. What was the gcc command again? i installed 3.4 but what came after?
[08:15] <Warbo> cubik: "sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/gcc-3.4 /usr/bin/gcc" will change the link /usr/bin/gcc to point to 3.4 instead of 4.0
[08:15] <tanek> hi, how do i get dhclient to run at boot? :P didnt configure that during installation, since i didnt have a lan present at that time
[08:15] <chaz_> Hmm... ompaul , do you know where the Guificatons theme folder is located?
[08:15] <jared_> okay, i'm trying to install the 3d ati drivers. and i'mfollowing the directions in the hardware section of the ubuntu FAQ guide in help
[08:15] <thetallest> he he he tristanmike that was the first thing I found on source forge :P
[08:15] <chaz_> ok dont worry
[08:15] <chaz_> thanks anyway
[08:15] <jared_> i get this: jared@laptop:~/My Programs/Regatta$ sudo depmod -a ; sudo modprobe fglrx
[08:15] <jared_> FATAL: Error inserting fglrx (/lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/volatile/fglrx.ko): No such device
[08:16] <amphi> cubik: just setting the env var CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 should be enough I think
[08:16] <thetallest> ok.... now it did lots but just spammed src/glee.h:9863: error
[08:16] <chaz_> haha i cant even get fglrx to work
[08:16] <dli> tanek, edit your /etc/network/interfaces , something like , "  auto eth0  " , "  iface eth0 inet dhcp "
[08:16] <chaz_> *hits graphics card*
[08:17] <Warbo> amphi: Oh, I didn't know that. Anyway I've never had problems with my method
[08:17] <jared_> when i followed the nvidia steps at home(on my other pc) it worked great.
[08:17] <amphi> Warbo: no, you wouldn't - 'CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 make' or whatever is handy if you just need to use that compiler on the odd occasion
[08:17] <Oswyn> is there any way to do a basic server install of ubuntu and then install xwindows/fluxbox and still have autoconfiguration of X11?
[08:18] <ompaul> chaz_, which kind of video card
[08:18] <Warbo> amphi: This is for nvidia installer (latest version needed in Breezy to get composote+glx)
[08:18] <cubikdice> w00t!
[08:18] <NoUse> Oswyn there is a server install and then you can apt-get all the programs you want
[08:18] <tanek> thx dli
[08:18] <cubikdice> Warbo, nice :D now what
[08:19] <chaz_> ompaul, Sapphire ATI X800 GTO lol
[08:19] <dli> Oswyn, for X configuration, try " sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg "
[08:19] <Oswyn> dli: thats what i was looking for, thank you!
[08:19] <jared_> ompaul: i'm trying Radeon 7500
[08:20] <chaz_> ompaul, all that happens when I install it is i get a black screen lol
[08:20] <amphi> jared_: I have one of them
[08:20] <Warbo> cubikdice: Now you need to add these lines (I have put > for a new line) to the end of /etc/X11/xorg.conf: Section "Extensions" > Option "Composite" "enable" > EndSection
[08:20] <bobulooo> jcs, is there a way to automatically refresh your dhcp connection?  My wireless connection dies if I don't..
[08:20] <ompaul> jared_, chaz_  have a look at the message from the bot
[08:20] <ubuntu> DBO: hi any news?
[08:20] <chaz_> lol k
[08:20] <amphi> jared_: xorg supports 3d accel with the 'radeon' driver
[08:20] <chaz_> As of this writing the x800 cards are difficult to get working
[08:20] <chaz_> lol
[08:20] <amphi> chaz_: you don't say ;)
[08:21] <chaz_> amphi, have u done it?
[08:21] <Warbo> amphi: Whatever you want to call it I wouldn't use "accel" (in my experience anyway)
[08:21] <thetallest> how can I get terminal to kick out the results to a text file?
[08:21] <amphi> chaz_: no, i have a very trailing edge card
[08:21] <znuff> NoUse, more help please... remove gnome-desktop, installed xubuntu-desktop, still in gnome o.O
[08:21] <thetallest> I'm trying to install sommin and it keeps failing
[08:21] <chaz_> trailing edge?
[08:21] <jared_> ompaul: it says:The 'fglrx' driver does not support cards earlier than the 8500.
[08:21] <Warbo> thetallest: Put "> file" at the end (where file is the file you dump it to)
[08:22] <jared_> ompaul: i have 7500
[08:22] <ompaul> jared_, then use the ati driver that comes with ubuntu
[08:22] <dli> thetallest, try " blahblah &> foo.output "
[08:22] <tonyyarusso> thetallest: Usually 'command-that-spits-stuff-out > errorfile.txt' will do the trick.
[08:22] <NoUse> znuff you need to select xfce as the sesion in gdm
[08:22] <amphi> Warbo: on a radeon 7500 ? it works well here ( ~1000fps in glxgears), more than enough for celestia and stellarium, which is all I use it for
[08:22] <jared_> amphi: how did you install it?
[08:22] <cubikdice> Warbo, wanna pastebin your xorg.conf? so i can make sure i got it right
[08:22] <znuff> hmmm
[08:22] <znuff> let's see
[08:22] <ubuntu> DBO: bit like talking to myself
[08:22] <amphi> jared_: you need the kernel support and the xorg radeon driver, that's it
[08:22] <darkgod> hello
[08:22] <thetallest> cool, now who wants to look at an error file :P
[08:22] <dli> thetallest, or, " blahblah 2>&1 > foo.output ", " man bash " for more
[08:23] <darkgod> hello
[08:23] <Warbo> cubikdice: Well, I don't have Comosite enabled but I will pastebin an example
[08:23] <cubikdice> alright
[08:23] <jared_> amphi you mean xorg-driver-fglrx
[08:23] <ompaul> NoUse, you should change your nick to useful, because your worth it :-)
[08:24] <NoUse> ompaul haha, why thank you
[08:24] <darkgod> i have a dilema... i have no monitor pluged in my system, my problem is that my desktop screen through vnc in 640x480 max
[08:24] <amphi> Warbo: I have 'Option          "EnablePageFlip" "true"' which makes opengl progs behave strangely if you switch to a VT and back to X, but that's just a "don't do that then" ;)
[08:24] <darkgod> i think it;s because no videocard gets detected...
[08:24] <darkgod> how can i fix this any idea ?
[08:24] <ubuntu> ompaul; pass the choc's i want one
[08:24] <amphi> jared_: no, fglrx doesn't support that card AFAIK - the xorg radeon driver does, see man radeon
[08:24] <doped1> why do i get this message when i try to compile: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
[08:25] <thetallest> what does "g++ -ansi -Wall -Werror -g -O3 -march=i586 -mfpmath=387   -DTIXML_USE_STL -o src/Player.o -c src/Player.cpp" mean?
[08:25] <Znuff> NoUse, now XGL and Compiz ?
[08:26] <mjcs> thetallest: it's compiling the source code into an application
[08:26] <NoUse> Znuff #ubuntu+1 and #ubuntu-xgl
[08:26] <doped1> solved the prob
[08:26] <Znuff> thanks
[08:26] <darkgod> any one... bored enough .... so he could help me figure out something and find a solution
[08:26] <darkgod> ????
[08:26] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright i just made it look like the others
[08:26] <Warbo> cubikdice: I think that http://pastebin.com/733451 this is right (it is mine with the AllowGLXWithComposite added (which may not be needed anymore) and the extensions section
[08:26] <thetallest> ok but then it goes src/GLee.h:9863: error: `dpy' was not declared in this scope for thousands of lines
[08:27] <Ribs> you're missing some files
[08:27] <Ribs> (probably)
[08:27] <tanek> which xorg version is breezy running?
[08:27] <thetallest> ok...... how do I sort that?
[08:27] <mjcs> thetallest: it's a problem with the source code i would assume...
[08:27] <amphi> thetallest: er, gnu c++ compile ansi-conformant src showing all warnings include debugging symbols dangerous optimisations ;) for i586 cpu with 387 floating point support and define some symbol part of mplayer ;)
[08:27] <cubikdice> Warbo, ok cool
[08:27] <cubikdice> Warbo, so what now? restart X again?
[08:28] <thetallest> ok......
[08:28] <Warbo> cubikdice: Yes, then try that xcompmgr command
[08:28] <bobulooo> is there a way to deactive and reactivate a network interface from the command line?  (same as the network settings app does in gnome)
[08:28] <mjcs> lol amphi.. didn't think he wanted a literal translation!
[08:28] <darkgod> gess everyone is buzy... :D
[08:28] <amphi> mjcs: heh
[08:28] <dli> bobbyd,  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[08:28] <darkgod> bobulooo: ifup/ifdonw
[08:28] <dli> bobulooo,  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[08:28] <Warbo> cubikdice: One thing I have noticed with Composite though is that the panel sometimes goes behind the Nautilus background (annoying but easy to fix)
[08:28] <jorgg> when playing sounds in flashanimations, the volume isnt controlled by the the volume. How to fix?
[08:29] <jared_> amphi: i'm it won't pass cedega's glxgears test, not sure how fast that is, could you help me configure it?
[08:29] <loststar4545> can you over clock on linux
[08:29] <amphi> thetallest: actually, I was guessing about mplayer ;)
[08:29] <Warbo> jorgg: Should be controlled by the PCM volume
[08:29] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright brb :)
[08:29] <amphi> jared_: I can try - PM?
[08:29] <mjcs> loststar4545: overclocking is a hardware thing. nothing to do with what OS you're running..
[08:29] <thetallest> amphi: got any ideas what I need to do to get this to work?
[08:29] <Warbo> loststar4545: I have overclocked my Athlon using the BIOS
[08:29] <jorgg> Warbo: how can i make one volume for all sound?
[08:30] <jared_> amphi: what do you mean by PM??
[08:30] <amphi> jared_: private message
[08:30] <bobulooo> dli, thanks.  I think that's what I'm looking for -- really just want to update a dhcp connection every now and then
[08:30] <loststar4545> can you overclock a Graphics card
[08:30] <darkgod> Warbo: i see your a pro... do you know how i could prevent my ubuntu desktop to run on 640x480, when i boot my machine with no monitor pluged in ?
[08:30] <Subhuman> loststar4545, yes, if itz nvidia.
[08:30] <Warbo> jorgg: That's what Master is for (PCM is for all "Wave" type sound [not MIDI and stuff] )
[08:30] <doped1> when i configure "genius-0.7.4", and i try to "make", I get the folowing error: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.  what to do?
[08:30] <Subhuman> loststar4545, "sudo apt-get install nvclock" and dont go crazy :D
[08:30] <cubikdice> w00t
[08:30] <mjcs> loststar4545: ask google.
[08:30] <cubikdice> alright
[08:30] <loststar4545> i have a nvidia graphics card how do i overclock it
[08:30] <jared_> amphi: sry, never set that up before
[08:31] <Warbo> darkgod: Sorry, no idea (and I laugh at being called a pro!)
[08:31] <cubikdice> Warbo, i can see it working, but i didnt see the nvidia logo this time
[08:31] <Subhuman> loststar4545, jus said :D
[08:31] <Subhuman> Subhuman> loststar4545, "sudo apt-get install nvclock"
[08:31] <Warbo> cubikdice: Did you add the "Option "NoLogo" "true"" to your xorg.conf? That gets rid of it
[08:31] <darkgod> Warbo: from my perspective ... YEES YOU ARE... :p
[08:31] <cubikdice> Warbo, no...
[08:31] <jorgg> Warbo: i cheked it. My PCM is set to zero, but still flash sounds is very high
[08:32] <amphi> thetallest: it's hard to say what the cause of the problem is, apart from dpy not being declared as the compiler says
[08:32] <jared_> amhpi: what do you want me to do??
[08:32] <kane777> hi...
[08:32] <darkgod> do you guys have a forum ... as well maybe someon could help me there with my problem ... :-s
[08:32] <Warbo> darkgod: Been using Linux for about 18 months (before that I used win 3.1, 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, NT4 all in 2001, and before that AmigaOS since 1992)
[08:32] <nicolas_> hi, i just switched to ubuntu and my speaker icon for the mixer just beside the clock disappeared in my ChaninDoojle gnome themes, im trying get the icon picture from another theme, and i cant find any of them in other themes, does anyone knows how it that file named ?
[08:32] <amphi> jared_: identify to services ;) do /msg nickserv help identify if you don't know how
[08:32] <mjcs> darkgod: www.ubuntuforums.org
[08:33] <cubikdice> Warbo, and now i have no GLX
[08:33] <t-thing> Hi. Why does the default directory permissions give read and write permissions for everybody?
[08:33] <darkgod> Warbo: me too .... :)) only i am using linux 2 monts....
[08:33] <nicolas_> or how can i modifiy the icon that the volume controller gnome applet is using ?
[08:33] <darkgod> mjcs: thx ....
[08:33] <Warbo> cubikdice: Hmmm. "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and try setting it up there
[08:33] <jared_> amphi: id'd
[08:33] <preglow> is it common for the dapper upgrade routine to vomit on nvidia-glx?
[08:33] <jared_> amphi: done.
[08:33] <tonyyarusso> t-thing: That depends on the directory - defaults will be whatever it thinks makes the most sense generally for that location.
[08:34] <mjcs> Warbo: lol, you sued AmigaOS until 2001?!
[08:34] <cubikdice> Warbo, well this only happened after the composite thing was insterted
[08:34] <mjcs> *used
[08:34] <Madangren> How do I open a program as root in Ubuntu?  I opened a terminal and ran "su" but the root account doesn't seem to be activated.  It has no password.
[08:34] <Flannel> Madangren: sudo
[08:34] <mjcs> Madangren: sudo, or gksudo
[08:34] <Warbo> mjcs: I still do! (3.0 because my 3.9 never arrived)
[08:34] <Madangren> So I would type "sudo ark" to open ark as root?
[08:34] <mjcs> lol
[08:34] <cubikdice> Warbo, ah crap how many KB is 256MB
[08:35] <mjcs> Madangren: yup.
[08:35] <jorgg> why is flash sound volume still very high after Ive turn down the volume?
[08:35] <t-thing> tonyyarusso: Well example for home directories which 755 default - that give read permissions for everybody on the computer, doesn't it?
[08:35] <Warbo> mjcs: Actually, now that I have bought Moho I don't really have a use for AmigaOS (except it is faster than EUAE)
[08:35] <Madangren> ERROR: Communication problem with ark, it probably crashed.
[08:35] <mo^> Madangren, or you can type "gksudo ark"
[08:35] <Tormentoso> Hello.
[08:35] <tonyyarusso> t-thing: Yes.
[08:35] <Warbo> cubikdice: You don't need to enter anything unless it is "shared memory" (built into motherboard)
[08:35] <ompaul> darkgod, if you want mailing lists we have a few: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ the user help one is a mirror of some part of the forums
[08:35] <Madangren> gksudo worked.  Thank you all ^_^
[08:36] <Tormentoso> Do anybody knows how to make work USB ADSL Modem Amigo CA80/85?
[08:36] <tonyyarusso> t-thing: I guess someone decided home directories generally aren't secret, and if they are, you would bother the set that?
[08:36] <t-thing> tonyyarusso: That doesn't make sense to me. And I created a new directory on my home directory and it has the same permissions. I don't want everybody who has accounts on this computer to read my files.
[08:36] <mjcs> Warbo: Moho.. as in cartoon animation?
[08:36] <Warbo> mjcs: Yes
[08:36] <cubikdice> Warbo, use kernel framebuffer device interface?
[08:36] <mjcs> Warbo: ooh interesting
[08:36] <Warbo> mjcs: It actually beats DPaint (GAP doesn't!)
[08:36] <mjcs> lol
[08:36] <Warbo> cubikdice: I said no, not sure what it does really
[08:36] <t-thing> tonyyarusso: Interesting choice.
[08:37] <phreekbird> ok what are the major issues with dapper? i mean dose it work well with dri, cedega and stuff like that? (currently using ubuntu breezy and dri is not working at all)
[08:37] <phreekbird> 40%downloading xubuntu
[08:38] <jjazz> phreekbird: My issue with dapper is that it's kernel locked my box
[08:38] <Pyru> Hello I need some help please, I installed webmin and I cant seem to completely uninstall it :S
[08:38] <tonyyarusso> t-thing: I think if you change the permissions on the directory itself that will change the defaults for new subdirectories.  Like, 'chmod 700 /home/user' so it ends up as drwx------.
[08:38] <Warbo> jjazz: New security features :)
[08:38] <jjazz> Warbo: Perhaps they're a tad overzealous. ;)
[08:39] <t-thing> tonyyarusso: nope, doesn't work that way.
[08:39] <tonyyarusso> t-thing: Hmm...
[08:39] <jjazz> t-thing: Perhaps you want to research setting your umask.
[08:39] <phreekbird> ok has anyone else had a malformed box? not saying its not a problem with dapper jjazz but it could just be a fluke, how many other peoples boxes are toast?
[08:40] <jjazz> phreekbird: My box isn't toast.  I restored from a breezy backup and I'm fine now.  No permanent damage. :)
[08:40] <t-thing> jjazz: is umask the default permission setting? How do I do that?
[08:40] <Pyru> Hello I need some help please, I installed webmin and I cant seem to completely uninstall it :S
[08:40] <Warbo> phreekbird: Mine is fine, as is my Dad's (upgraded over the weekend now that I know how to get eagle-usb installed on 2.6.15) but those were upgrades, not fresh Dapper installs
[08:40] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright, restart X?
[08:40] <dataangel> Why doesn't the kernel-source-2.6.15 package decompress and create a symbolic link for /usr/src/linux? That's how it's behaved on the last two distros I tried. It just seems to dump a .tar.bz2 of the source into /usr/src.
[08:40] <Warbo> cubikdice: Yep
[08:40] <jjazz> t-thing: I've not actually messed with it.  man umask and go from there.
[08:41] <Warbo> dataangel: Do they go into /lib/modules/kernelversion/build? (just curious because I forgot)
[08:41] <t-thing> jjazz: no entry for umask
[08:41] <jjazz> that's weird.
[08:41] <t-thing> jjazz: man mount
[08:42] <Falstius> dataangel: /usr/src/linux has been depricated for years.
[08:42] <Falstius> it should go into /usr/src/linux-2.6.15-long-string
[08:42] <dataangel> Warbo: Nope, actually the reason I'm looking at this at all is I'm trying to follow a tutorial for how to make kernel modules (adding a "Hellow world!" entry to /proc) and it seems the ubuntu packages don't create /lib/modules/kernelversion/build (the build folder is missing) which is problematic. I haven't compiled the kernel yet though so that could also be the cause...
[08:42] <jjazz> t-thing: Well, it sure looks like you can set the umask on a volume when you mount it.  Maybe google has something relevant.
[08:43] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright i got GLX again. but no logo comes up and xcompmgr doesnt work anymore
[08:43] <Warbo> cubikdice: Hmmm. Try glxinfo and see if it is using software
[08:43] <julle> hello anyone that could help me for a while??
[08:43] <md1975> hola a todos
[08:44] <julle> got some prob with my rights and mounting..
[08:44] <cubikdice> Warbo. alot of crap comes up, how do i tell?
[08:44] <Warbo> cubikdice: Hang on...
[08:44] <jjazz> t-thing: What happens if you do umask at the command line?
[08:44] <t-thing> jjazz: it might be worth looking, but I'll do that later. It still puzzles me, why on earth this kind of default choise has been made. There must be some reason for it, but still.
[08:44] <cubikdice> Warbo, alrigh
[08:44] <md1975> alguien me puede ayudar??
=== towolf is now known as bahodir
[08:44] <t-thing> jjazz: gives a numerical value, the umask i guess
[08:44] <kmilo> md1975, #ubuntu-es
[08:45] <Warbo> cubikdice: Look for Mesa Indirect
[08:45] <jjazz> t-thing: You don't have to change the umask at mount.  Just do 'umask 0077' at the command line and you'll be set to not give anybody besides you any perms at all.
[08:45] <yukonho> I've got a hard drive that refuses to be partitioned by the ubuntu installer or GParted.  What are my other options?
[08:45] <cubikdice> Warbo, nope doesnt say that anywhere
[08:45] <t-thing> jjazz: 0077 translates to 700?
[08:45] <Warbo> cubikdice: Then your driver should be working (mine isn't but that's another story)
[08:45] <t-thing> jjazz: How do I set this system wide?
[08:45] <md1975> ok thankx and sorry
[08:45] <jjazz> t-thing: Yes.  You subtract it from 777. (This is from http://www.scrye.com/~kevin/lsh/feb-02/Security-HOWTO-5.html)
[08:45] <cubikdice> Warbo, alright
[08:46] <jjazz> t-thing: That I don't know, sorry.  Ask google.

[08:46] <t-thing> jjazz: oright. Thanks, you've been most helpful.

[08:48] <roryy> julle: in short, use sudo. the wiki page explains more
[08:49] <seb_> does anyone know where to get .wmv codec for totem
[08:49] <Warbo> cubikdice: The program I am after is gcompmgr, but I can't find an Ubuntu package of it, but I did find this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75527
[08:49] <roryy> julle: i see a #ubuntu-se -- if your first language is swedish, you might prefer that.
[08:49] <Warbo> seb_: Totem gstreamer or Totem Xine?
[08:50] <mkohler> When I upgraded from Breezy to Dapper, my System->Administration menu was stripped. Now I only have "Network Tools", "Printing", "System Log", and "System Monitor". Does anyone know how to reset that menu? I've tried removing all of my .gnome[2]  dirs.
[08:50] <seb_> gstreamer 0.8.11
[08:50] <seb_> gstreamer 0.8.11
[08:51] <seb_> sorry i dont know how to private message
[08:51] <seb_> im a noob
[08:51] <Warbo> seb_: If you have Universe then install all of the plugin packages you can for gstreamer and try it then. If not maybe use Xine (I do) [unless it is a wmv10 or something] 
[08:51] <phreekbird> its /msg nameofperson message goes here ... i think
[08:51] <lsuactiafner> how do i set the default kde player to mplayer?
[08:52] <seb_> Warbo: where can i find the plugin pakages
[08:52] <Warbo> lsuactiafner: In Konqueror settings you can change default actions for file types
[08:52] <Warbo> !tell seb_ about universe
[08:52] <lsuactiafner> k
[08:52] <dataangel> Falstius: Why would you want to deprecate /usr/src/linux? Most of the differences between the -x package versions are little tweaks, and a deb could update the symlink each time anyway. I always understood it to mean " pointing to source of current kernel version". How can that be outdated? :P
[08:53] <dataangel> Falstius: And it's outdated according to who? Seems current if most distros still do it ;p
[08:53] <Warbo> dataangel: 2.6.12 and 2.6.115 and stuff like that have their own kernel sources, but nothing more minor
[08:53] <Warbo> 2.6.15 sorry
[08:54] <dataangel> Warbo: All the more reason then :P
=== lars-ut-away is now known as lars-ut
[08:55] <dataangel> Does anyone know what I should be substituting for /lib/modules/2.6.15-23-686/build in my kernel module makefiles? I'm just trying to make a simple example work but it complains the build folder just isn't there :P
[08:56] <Warbo> dataangel: Do you have the headers installed?
[08:56] <dataangel> Warbo: Yep.
[08:56] <Warbo> dataangel: OK then
[08:56] <dataangel> Warbo. linux-headers-2.6.15-23-686
[08:56] <dataangel> Warbo: kernel-package too because I thought it might be related but apparently not
[08:56] <kyath> anyone have luck with their mx1000 on dapper
[08:56] <madmeix> #hv.css
[08:56] <Warbo> dataangel: You and your lousy 2.6.15-23. I make do with a measly 2.6.15-18!
[08:56] <dataangel> Warbo: lol.
[08:57] <amphi> dataangel: kernel-package is for building kernels + modules and creating a .deb from them
[08:57] <dataangel> Warbo: AMD64?
[08:57] <Warbo> dataangel: Nope. I'm running from USB HD booted from CD, and I forgot how I made the CD so I can't update the kernel on it

[08:58] <tanek> thx
[08:59] <tanek> same mount commands as regular hds?
[08:59] <Warbo> tanek: Yes (with partitions as sda1, sda2 and stuff. Don't try to mount the device itself!)
[09:00] <tanek> ;P ill check that out
[09:00] <iNiku> do the ubuntu kernel source pkgs contain the default ubuntu configuration in addition to the ubuntu patches?
[09:00] <tanek> Warbo, dont have any /dev/sda device :/
[09:01] <Warbo> tanek: Is it plugged in? (also check for sdb, sdc and stuff)
[09:01] <tanek> ye its plugged in
[09:01] <t-thing> jjazz: I ended up with 027 umask
[09:01] <[NP] Tangent> do any of you know of any repositories that have the Muse music program available?
[09:01] <mr_hus> Does the freetype build available from the ubuntu repositories support BCI?? Or you need to build it yourself?
[09:01] <cubikdice> w00t
[09:02] <jjazz> t-thing: Sounds reasonable to me.
[09:02] <Warbo> cubikdice: Everything OK now?
[09:02] <tanek> dont have any devices starting with sd ;/
[09:02] <cubikdice> Warbo, hold on gonna check glx
[09:02] <crimsun> mr_hus: yes, it supports it.
[09:02] <cubikdice> Warbo, yup
[09:02] <cubikdice> bloody perfect :D
[09:02] <cubikdice> thanks you so much
[09:02] <crimsun> mr_hus: it does not, however, use Apple's patented stuff.
[09:03] <Warbo> cubikdice: You can mess around with timing and stuff for fades and edit the command in your session
[09:03] <cubikdice> yeah, i'd like it to fad a bit faster
[09:03] <Warbo> cubikdice: man xcompmgr then
[09:03] <cubikdice> am already on it :)
[09:04] <mr_hus> crimsun: does a good job anyway or apple's patented stuff does a better job?
[09:04] <Warbo> cubikdice: Also look for gcompmgr and xtransset
[09:04] <cubikdice> alright
[09:04] <crimsun> mr_hus: seems fine to me, and we're not permitted to distribute Apple's patented stuff anyhow
[09:04] <mr_hus> crimsun: im still not quite satisfied with how the fonts get rendered on my box...
[09:04] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, muse sequencer is in universe in breezy
[09:04] <[NP] Tangent> ah
[09:04] <[NP] Tangent> cool
[09:04] <[NP] Tangent> thanks
[09:04] <C|int> crimsun,  :D
[09:05] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/sound/muse
[09:05] <mr_hus> crimsun: but if i wanted i could build freetype myself with the patented stuff right?
[09:05] <jorgg> how can i make flash play sounds to alsa so i can controll the volume?
[09:05] <crimsun> mr_hus: no, you can't
[09:05] <Falstius> dataangel: because it encourages people to just look at /usr/src/linux instead of checking the version .. leads to a lot of badly made modules.  And it isn't hard to define CFLAGs=-I /usr/src/linux-`uname -r` instead of /usr/src/linux.
[09:05] <Warbo> jorgg: If they don't play to ALSA then you don;t have any sound :)
[09:06] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, do you know this? http://ubuntustudio.com
[09:06] <[NP] Tangent> no I don't
[09:06] <[NP] Tangent> I'll check it out
[09:06] <jorgg> warbo: i have sound when not playing other sounds. But then i cant controll the volume..
[09:06] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, have fun :)
[09:06] <Warbo> jorgg: Unless you are still using OSS
[09:06] <crimsun> Falstius: better yet is to use /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build as Linus insists
[09:06] <jorgg> Warbo: what should i use? OSS alsa ESD?
[09:07] <Warbo> jorgg: I get that problem with not playing sound when other apps are, but that is probably due to Flash playing to ALSA (a bad thing, it should do it to a proper sound server like ESD)
[09:07] <jared_> amphi: I'm back
[09:07] <ubuntu> amphi: hi hows it going
[09:07] <NoUse> Warbo why should it play to ESD when ALSA is replacing ESD?
[09:07] <jorgg> so alsa and OSS is no good?
[09:07] <Falstius> crimsun: you're probably right.
[09:08] <Warbo> jorgg: ALSA plays all of your sound. OSS is just emulated by ALSA. ESD is a sound server, which would let you play other sounds at the same time (but Flash doesn't use it) I don't have any experience with your problem though, so I can't offer any practical advice
[09:08] <NoUse> jorgg ALSA is the new standard, so use that when possible
[09:08] <jared_> amphi: Still no direct rendering
[09:08] <jorgg> Warbo: okay
[09:08] <Subhuman> Flash lags, because FF makes it go through itz own dsp, then output
[09:08] <jorgg> NoUse: okay

[09:10] <cubikdice> Warbo, so incase the panel bug you were explaining happens, what should i do?
[09:11] <C|int> amphi,  :D
[09:11] <Warbo> cubikdice: run "killall gnome-panel" and that will stop the panel and it will restart itself above everything (although stuff run from it may close as well, like my gdesklets and gaim do)
[09:11] <C|int> seen you hangin out in debian chan :D

[09:20] <adambrady> It goes through the motions of burning the disc but when you try to read the disc it comes back as blank
[09:20] <drkat> well my biggest let down is PnP
[09:21] <C|int> I"m just pushing myself as a Systems Engineer , and at my College, so I can be an advanced user, I mean, hardly anyone uses linux and noone uses FreeBSD at all,
[09:21] <C|int> I like using something, that is rare to people.
[09:21] <C|int> yep
[09:21] <Mortal`> I'll try again :), is there a hotkey to change workspaces like Alt+tab?
[09:21] <Stormx2> Stupid MSN...
[09:21] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, for dedicated linux audio help, there's also #lad (linux audio developers and users), and, I believe, also #ubuntustudio.
[09:21] <ranpha> question . is there a more advanced program with a GUI for configuring samba??
[09:21] <C|int> I was watching, Linus Torvalds gettin dumped in water , it was some gig going on, maybe look old, it was hillarious :P
[09:21] <roryy> Mortal`: in gnome, Ctl+Alt+Left arrow / right-arrow should work
[09:22] <NoUse> C|int could you continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[09:22] <Mortal`> roryy, thanks a lot, it works
[09:22] <t-thing> jjazz: It's a bit shame to admit that I'm not. I never just got around to read about umasks. I do know something about security, luckily. That network security section is bit short, gotta find longer document on that.
[09:22] <sip> hi, spanish chanel please...?

[09:22] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[09:22] <groo> i just installed dapper and i cant find configuration editor what is it's name for the cli?
[09:22] <brovold> gconf-editor?
[09:22] <mormoloc> ok i receive the following http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14557 when compiling  vim7. What does it mean?
[09:22] <groo> i dont have system tools on my appplications menu
[09:23] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, sorry, it's #ubuntu-studio
[09:23] <groo> ok thankls
[09:23] <ranpha> question . is there a more advanced program with a GUI for configuring samba??
[09:23] <tristanmike> mormoloc, did you install "build-essential" ?
[09:24] <[NP] Tangent> alright
[09:24] <mormoloc> what are those
[09:24] <[NP] Tangent> I'll try this Ubuntu Studio thing out
[09:24] <harrisonk> is there anything special I have to do to setup a server ?
[09:24] <sybariten3> hey, i fiddled a bit with apt trying to install tomdoc or tomboy or whatever its called
[09:24] <tristanmike> mormoloc, they are a set of "essential" compiling packages
[09:24] <sybariten3> well, i didnt succeed
[09:24] <harrisonk> I ran srcds and checked on canyouseeme.org and it didn't show the port as being open
[09:24] <[NP] Tangent> mormoloc, build-essential is in Synaptic
[09:25] <[NP] Tangent> you'll want it
[09:25] <ubuntu> still in live cd no hope i guess
[09:25] <adambrady> I guess no one has an answer to my issue?
[09:25] <sybariten3> it complains about libgnome-cil, among others. However, i am now trying to install "Octave", and i get a similar error message. This was through apt. My question is: could i have some crap left in my system that hogs all apt operations??
[09:25] <[NP] Tangent> whoa
[09:25] <[NP] Tangent> holy crap
[09:25] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, good luck. Linux audio is a bit of a hassle still, so prepare for a bit of reading and tinkering.
[09:26] <[NP] Tangent> my volume keys work with ubuntu
[09:26] <[NP] Tangent> woohoo
[09:26] <harrisonk> anyone have experience with srcds in ubuntu?
[09:26] <sybariten3> because apt-get install octave complains about mono, for instance. And i dont think octave needs mono.
[09:26] <NoUse> adambrady how did you install cdrecord?
[09:26] <tristanmike> adambrady, are the discs still blank? or are they empty (written to, but no data) ?
[09:26] <C|int> see ya :D
[09:26] <adambrady> I installed CDRecord using Synaptic. The CD's are blank.
[09:27] <scottt106> Easy question:  Where can I see what version of ubuntu I am running, as far as warty/hoary/dapper/breezy?
[09:27] <tristanmike> adambrady, forgive the stupid question, but are you sure you don't have simulation checked ?
[09:27] <roryy> scottt106: run 'lsb_release -a' in a terminal
[09:27] <NoUse> adambrady in the error you pasted you were getting messages with cdrecord in /usr/bin/X11
[09:27] <adambrady> lol yeah i'm sure.
[09:27] <scottt106> thanks rorry
[09:28] <adambrady> you think if i re install it it will fix the issue?
[09:28] <[NP] Tangent> so Sanne
[09:28] <[NP] Tangent> you probably make music too, right?
[09:28] <[NP] Tangent> what kind of music do you make?
[09:28] <NoUse> adambrady I'm not sure how cdrecord got into that directory
[09:28] <NoUse> adambrady are you using all default synaptic repos?
[09:28] <adambrady> yes
[09:29] <racestoapril1> hi
[09:29] <racestoapril1> i have a question
[09:29] <NoUse> adambrady which release of ubuntu are you running?
[09:29] <adambrady> 5.10
[09:30] <ranpha> question . is there a more advanced program with a GUI for configuring samba??
[09:30] <jorgg> Warbo: ah.. finally fixed it! :) had to set aoss as the wrapper for dsp in firefox, and install alsa-oss. Now it works :)
[09:30] <NoUse> adambrady yeah I would try 'sudo apt-get --reinstall cdrecord'
[09:30] <Sanne> [NP] Tangent, I don't really *make* it right now, I'm still trying to find my music setup. My direction right now would be electronic music, but in the future I would also like to record voice, guitar and sax. But I fear we are getting a bit offtopic here...
[09:30] <kmilo> ranpha, swat

[09:31] <Cope> i appear to have alsa-utils, but not alsaconf
[09:31] <Cope> what provides alsaconf?
[09:31] <scottt106> How can I enable DAAP support in Rhythmbox (so I can view shared iTunes music from my Windows box)?
[09:32] <Cope> alsaconf is normally in the debian alsa-utils package
[09:32] <tuxinafedora> is ubuntu seriously only one disk?
[09:32] <tonyyarusso> I want to get feedback from Windows users that take a look at Dapper Live CDs.  Has anyone written a survey for usability, look and feel, etc. for gathering that sort of information?
[09:32] <NoUse> tuxinafedora yes
[09:33] <tuxinafedora> okay, is there a graphical installer?
[09:33] <NoUse> tuxinafedora there will be in dapper
[09:33] <honkzilla> Can anyone assist me with configuration of an older Orinoco/Lucent Gold 802.11b card (PC23E-H-FC) running under dapper?
[09:33] <ubuntu> do you need x-windows-server to use fluxbox
[09:33] <NoUse> ubuntu yes
[09:33] <racestoapril1> i'm having trouble finding the gstreamer package in synaptic
[09:34] <racestoapril1> to install it
[09:34] <ubuntu> NoUse: thanks
[09:34] <ryang> tonyyarusso: feedback for what?
[09:34] <NoUse> racestoapril1 there are many gstreamer packages
[09:34] <NoUse> racestoapril1 which plugin are you looking for?
[09:34] <tuxinafedora> noUse: how easy is it to choose partitions?
[09:34] <jorgg> what movieplayer is suggested to use in ubuntu?
[09:34] <racestoapril1> sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad
[09:34] <NoUse> tuxinafedora easy for me
[09:34] <racestoapril1> i found that

[09:35] <NoUse> !tell racestoapril1 about repos
[09:35] <ubuntu> just wondering if you need any X to run say vmware
[09:35] <icheyne> jorgg, I like totem
[09:35] <tonyyarusso> ryang: Whether it's easy to figure out, if the icons are super cool or lame, if it works, whether documentation is sufficient when they have problems, if they could find applications in the menus easily, anything.
[09:35] <[NP] Tangent> alright Sanne
[09:35] <NoUse> ubuntu yes
[09:35] <[NP] Tangent> doing this Ubuntu Studio stuff
[09:36] <ubuntu> NoUse; thought so fluxbox is pretty light
[09:36] <NoUse> ubuntu yeah
[09:36] <jorgg> do the movieplayers share codecs, or is the codec support independent for each player?
[09:36] <ubuntu> NoUse; I am in a live cd just now kernel panic
[09:37] <Sanne> tuxinafedora, I found an installation walkthrough for breezy (the recent distro, dapper will come out in June) that might give you an idea of the install: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jabra/breezy-docs.html
[09:37] <Warbo> jorgg: The major ones are seperate (MPlayer, Xine, VLC, etc.) but all Xine interfaces are the same and stuff like that

[09:38] <racestoapril1> i just don't understand how to make mp3's play
[09:38] <kirkunit> Madangren: go to the address of your router in your browser
[09:39] <racestoapril1> it's confusing
[09:39] <racestoapril1> i get an error message saying i need plugin's
[09:39] <icheyne> racestoapril1, have you tried Automatix?
[09:39] <racestoapril1> but i don't know where togo to get the plugins
[09:39] <Warbo> Madangren: Usually point your browser to the IP address of your router, but it is different for every router
[09:39] <racestoapril1> no
[09:39] <NoUse> !tell icheyne about automatix
[09:39] <racestoapril1> i haven't
[09:39] <Subhuman> tuxinafedora,yes if you use the live cd installer

[09:39] <kirkunit> Madangren: try 198.168.0.1, or 198.168.1.1
[09:39] <Warbo> kirkunit: 192.168 I think
[09:40] <Madangren> Crap... I don't remember the info on it >_<
[09:40] <NoUse> racestoapril1 try easyubuntu via the link above
[09:40] <kirkunit> Warbo: oops..you're right
[09:40] <racestoapril1> thanks NoUse
[09:40] <racestoapril1> i'll try
[09:40] <racestoapril1> and stay on here
[09:40] <Warbo> I type advice here, but I can't get port forwarding to work on my router :)
[09:40] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: #easyubuntu is the chat channel abut it
[09:40] <Madangren> Ah, okay.
[09:40] <kirkunit> Madangren: 192.168.0.1

[09:41] <racestoapril1> ok
[09:41] <EmxBA> does anyone know how to setup smart link modem
[09:41] <Madangren> Couldn't remember the password >_>
[09:41] <Warbo> Madangren: It may be called NAT
[09:41] <Madangren> Don't see that anywhere.
[09:42] <Madangren> Filtered private port range?
[09:42] <Warbo> EmxBA: linmodems.org I think
[09:42] <kirkunit> Madangren: port forwarding? can you see that? try 'advanced' options
[09:42] <Madangren> Kay, found it.
[09:42] <green_earz> Madangren: open the ports 10000 to 10010 and forward them to the ip address of torrent machine.
[09:42] <EmxBA> Warbo: i tried linmodems but i assume there is better suppert here (faster)
[09:43] <kirkunit> madangren: i use 6881 to 6889
[09:43] <Warbo> EmxBA: Just follow their instructions (it worked for me on RedHat 9)

[09:48] <Warbo> Abo: Hmmm, I logged out and now can't get back on!
[09:48] <tuxinafedora> and how hard would it be for ubuntu to install over an old install fo fedora

[09:48] <NoUse> tuxinafedora not hard, you just format the fedora partitions and use them for ubuntu
[09:48] <goscha1> hello, anyone from Poland?
[09:48] <Nailor> Abo: Hotmail account? Apparently hotmail is busted
[09:49] <tuxinafedora> NoUse is the install easy to understand?
[09:49] <NoUse> tuxinafedora yes

[09:51] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: apt-get help :P
[09:51] <EmxBA> GoLoGo: which drivers
[09:51] <Warbo> EmxBA: You can use wvdial but I prefer gnome-ppp (uses wvdial)
[09:51] <EmxBA> GoLoGo: try with NVidia drivers
[09:51] <tuxinafedora> I was never a fan of apt-get, but maybe this will change my mind.
[09:51] <GoLoGo> well its a live cd.... i was running the live cd desktop enviornment
[09:51] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: You can try a few frontents... synaptic, aptitude...
[09:51] <NoUse> tuxinafedora what didn't you like about apt-get?
[09:51] <EmxBA> Warbo: is gnome-ppp included with Ubuntu
[09:52] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: Ubuntu does a good job with it ^_^
[09:52] <Warbo> EmxBA: I don't think so
[09:52] <tuxinafedora> noUse: it was slow.
[09:52] <|neo> can some on helpme to set up a picture on grub background ?
[09:52] <EmxBA> NoUse: aptget rulez!
[09:52] <NoUse> tuxinafedora its faster than yum :-)
[09:52] <tuxinafedora> under fedora!
[09:52] <EmxBA> Warbo: never mind, i'll try gnomefiles.org
[09:52] <tuxinafedora> :-) and maybe it won't randomly bring my system to a grinding halt?
[09:52] <Warbo> tuxinafedora: It's a hell of a lot faster than Portage!
[09:52] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: Its about a year now

[09:53] <EmxBA> Warbo: what about Gnomedial
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[09:53] <GoLoGo> is it possible to install the latest nvidia drivers under a live cd desktop enviornment?
[09:53] <tuxinafedora> generally, how well does gentoo deal with compilin gfrom source?
[09:53] <NoUse> tuxinafedora well when you graft something as slick as apt-get onto something as bloated as Fedora, things are bound to get fouled up :-)
[09:53] <tuxinafedora> that sounds stupid, but installing with deps is a bitch at times.
[09:53] <NoUse> tuxinafedora what do you mean? all gentoo does is compile from source
[09:54] <EmxBA> GoLoGo: no, install Ubuntu
[09:54] <kbrooks> NoUse: it uses ebuilds
[09:54] <ShadowNova> A lot of my OpenGL applications are running abnormally slowly, notchy, etc. Is there some way to fix this?
[09:54] <NoUse> kbrooks yeah I know that
[09:54] <tuxinafedora> NoUse: that finds the deps as well.
[09:54] <rukuartic> ShadowNova: I've noticed that too
[09:54] <Warbo> tuxinafedora: I have only used Gentoo once, trying to rebuild Kororaa CD, and it took AGES just to get a list of what's available. Then it didn't even work!
[09:54] <tuxinafedora> I'm talking about tar files.
[09:54] <NoUse> tuxinafedora like any other distro I guess
[09:54] <tuxinafedora> cuz when ./configure breaks, that's a bad day :-P
[09:54] <ShadowNova> How do we fix it then?
[09:54] <NoUse> tuxinafedora perhaps ask that in #gentoo?
[09:54] <tuxinafedora> NoUse: some are less of a PITa than others.

[09:58] <rukuartic> ShadowNova: ...wait does that run under wine?
[09:58] <tuxinafedora> crap!
[09:58] <NoUse> kbrooks what?
[09:58] <racestoapril1> so there is no way to have mp3 support in 5.04
[09:58] <tuxinafedora> can someone send me a link to dapper?
[09:58] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: there is
[09:58] <Flannel> racestoapril1: yes there is.
[09:58] <rukuartic> racestoapril1: I'm playing an mp3 now.
[09:58] <rukuartic> !mp3
[09:58] <ubotu> I heard mp3 is a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[09:58] <ShadowNova> rukuartic, what?
[09:58] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: but not with EU
[09:58] <NoUse> !tell tuxinafedora about dapper
[09:58] <tuxinafedora> oh, that's a beta....
[09:58] <rukuartic> ShadowNova: How are you running stepmania? Is that ocmpliled for linux, or are you running it with wine?
[09:59] <ShadowNova> rukuartic, compiled for linux
[09:59] <rukuartic> Ah. o-o
[09:59] <Warbo> Well I am going to install the latest kernel in Dapper and rebuild my CD, wish me luck :)
[09:59] <rukuartic> still looking for anyone who'se used a laptop with linux... can anyone reccommend a good compatible laptop?
[09:59] <tuxinafedora> please tell me ubuntu is slightly less bloated than fedora...
[09:59] <tuxinafedora> btw.
[09:59] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: it fits in 1 cd :P
[09:59] <ShadowNova> dont do hp laptops
[09:59] <NoUse> tuxinafedora 1 CD vs 4, you do the math
[09:59] <rukuartic> ShadowNova: thats a given XD
[10:00] <tuxinafedora> rukuartic: IBM thinkpad.
[10:00] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: Toshiba any good?
[10:00] <ShadowNova> My friend tried. Nothing at all was supported. Not even his monitor.
[10:00] <tuxinafedora> NoUse: I don't know what gets downloaded.
[10:00] <Pip> w
[10:00] <tuxinafedora> rukartic: a pain in the balls to deal with last I tried.
[10:00] <NoUse> tuxinafedora the default install is all off one CD, the default install of Fedora comes off at least 3 if I remember correctly
[10:00] <rukuartic> Anything made by HP or Dell or Compaq doesn't work too swiftly with linux... as I've understood.
[10:00] <tuxinafedora> rukartic: better than HP though.
[10:01] <tuxinafedora> NoUse: Does this come with openoffice 2.0?
[10:01] <ShadowNova> No, Dell is wonderful.
[10:01] <tonyyarusso> rukuartic: I'll second that.  T43 here.
[10:01] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: yes.
[10:01] <NoUse> tuxinafedora yes
[10:01] <tuxinafedora> AND, how hard are the printers to set up?
[10:01] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: It comes default install with almost everything you need.
[10:01] <tuxinafedora> tonraruss: t42P
[10:01] <NoUse> tuxinafedora easy
[10:01] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: For everything else there's mastercar.... ....apt-get
[10:01] <ShadowNova> I use dell, and my sound card is the only think that is wierd, but it usually works
[10:01] <tuxinafedora> noUse: good, because localhost:<portnumber for cups> was not easy to remember.
[10:02] <rukuartic> tuxinafedora: man cups
[10:02] <tonyyarusso> My HP PSC 1310 worked wonderfully - just selected from the menu.
[10:02] <tuxinafedora> does this come stock with alsa?
[10:02] <ShadowNova> HP psc 2110 also works. Even with sane
[10:02] <NoUse> tuxinafedora yes
[10:02] <kbrooks> tuxinafedora: um, why do u care

[10:02] <tuxinafedora> kbrooks: my soundcard gets picky from time to time.
[10:02] <rajeev> i m not getting audio on my system its says some error msg as "Registry is not present or it is corrupted, please update it by running gst-register" SO can any one tell me what to do.. plz reply
[10:03] <racestoapril1> is there a version of automatix for 5.04
[10:03] <tuxinafedora> one last question... what 2.6 kernel does it ship with?
[10:03] <rukuartic> !automatix
[10:03] <ubotu> rumour has it, automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
[10:03] <ShadowNova> Speaking of, does anyone use AUdacity? I can't get it to detect my sound card at all.
[10:03] <NoUse> racestoapril1 what part of adding repos confuses you?
[10:03] <Abo> I have installed KDE on ubuntu, now I would like to assign kde as the default window manager to one user, how can I do that?
[10:03] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: No
[10:03] <racestoapril1> i've done the things
[10:03] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: It only supports breezy
[10:03] <racestoapril1> and it still doesn't work
[10:03] <racestoapril1> ok
[10:04] <kbrooks> racestoapril1: why not upgrade to breezy?
[10:04] <tonyyarusso> Abo: When you log in selecting it from the sessions menu, it will ask whether you'd like to make it default for them.

[10:06] <racestoapril1> what version of gstreamer is for mp3's and 5.04
[10:06] <racestoapril1> i did?
[10:06] <rukuartic> rajeev: sudo gst-register maybe? It tells you to do that :P

[10:08] <NoUse> racestoapril1 try 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad'
[10:08] <rukuartic> wardi: Quick/ugly fix, copy to office, paste there.

[10:08] <rajeev> rukuartic, its says sudo: gst-register: command not found
[10:08] <wardi> rukuartic: that's what I'm doing
[10:08] <tonyyarusso> oscar: Usually you just need to plug it in.  It will mount in /media.
[10:08] <racestoapril1> just tired
[10:08] <racestoapril1> it
[10:08] <racestoapril1> tried*
[10:08] <racestoapril1> i get this

[10:08] <NoUse> racestoapril1 don't paste
[10:08] <rukuartic> ephesius: Your own computer
[10:09] <ephesius> i used to do that but my electric bill is incredibly high
[10:09] <oscar> tonyyarusso: i tried and i thought it mounted sda but i can find anything under /media or /mnt
[10:09] <rukuartic> ephesius: Is drupal a PHP/MySQL thing? You could try freepgs.com, they give php and mysql
[10:09] <Manika> !tell racestoapril1 about enter
[10:09] <ephesius> yea its php/mysql
[10:10] <tonyyarusso> oscar: Do you see it in /dev?

[10:11] <aLd> would someone help with syncing a windows ce device with ubuntu
[10:11] <cubikdice> !justask
[10:11] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[10:11] <Newbify2> !tell Newbify2 about xgl

[10:11] <cubikdice> hi
[10:11] <rajeev> rukuartic, r u there plz tell me what to go?? next
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[10:12] <dli> can I install grub to the boot sector of a windows partition (with windows installed) ?
[10:12] <sibblegp> for some reason, Azureus isn't connecting to any hosts......it's just sitting there not doing anything even though it says there are plenty of hosts in the swarm and that everything is fine.  Even after it sits for a few hours, it doesn't connect.  Any suggestions?
[10:12] <rajeev> jared_, plz tell me what to do next??
[10:12] <sibblegp> it only happens on this Ubuntu computer :(
[10:12] <soundray> dli: you can, but don't expect Windows to work after that.
[10:12] <Warbo> How would I COMPLETLEY reinstall something? Every file and config? (That is reinstall, NOT purge/install)
[10:13] <gpo> i installed xgl but i don't have kde borders anymore, even if i run gnome-window-decorator
[10:13] <cubikdice> sibblegp, did you make sure that the port was open?
[10:13] <dli> soundray, how to get windows work with grub on it? :(
[10:13] <racestoapril1> how large are the windows codecs
[10:13] <Warbo> gpo: kde-window-decorator?
[10:13] <gpo> it doesn't work
[10:13] <sibblegp> cubikdice, it says that everything was configured correctly.  You usually don't need to open any for Azureus to work properly.......how would I check anyways?
[10:13] <NoUse> gpo ask in #ubuntu-xgl
[10:13] <tonyyarusso> oscar: All right, well it's odd that it didn't mount automatically in /media, but you can try mounting it manually.  Usually USB drives will be Fat32 partitions (vfat).  'man mount' for more info.  (If it did mount in /media it would be by drive label, not sda, btw)
[10:13] <Warbo> gpo: Have you installed compiz-kde package?
[10:13] <gpo> warbo : yes
[10:14] <Manika> !tell Manika about amarok
[10:14] <cubikdice> sibblegp, yes you usually do. Click on tools > NAT / Firewall Test
[10:14] <chavo> Warbo, apt-get install --reinstall
[10:14] <racestoapril1> ok
[10:14] <NoUse> racestoapril1 I think like 12-17MB
[10:15] <cubikdice> sibblegp, then click test beside the port number
[10:15] <Warbo> chavo: That doesn't completely reinstall
[10:15] <sibblegp> cubikdice, it says its working fine
[10:15] <thetallest> is there a channel for total newbie ubuntu people?
[10:15] <racestoapril1> i have the windows codecs installed, but i still need the mp3, is there a site where i can get the codecs, like i got the windows codecs?

[10:15] <cubikdice> sibblegp, what port number is it?
[10:15] <bimberi> thetallest: this is it :)
[10:15] <tonyyarusso> thetallest: Here's fine.
[10:15] <thetallest> ok
[10:15] <NoUse> racestoapril1 no, mp3 support is in synaptic, you just have to add the right repos
[10:15] <sibblegp> cubikdice, 54972
[10:16] <rajeev> can any one tell me abt how to run the gst-register??
[10:16] <racestoapril1> ok, i guess that's the best i can do. i really do not understand why the commands are not making the codecs load off the cd
[10:17] <NoUse> can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list?
[10:17] <NoUse> racestoapril1 ^^

[10:17] <Manika> how can I update my amarok 1.3 to 1.4?
[10:17] <Warbo> What is the dpkg option to reinstall everything from a package (binaries, configs and everything)? [BTW, It isn't in the manual] 
[10:17] <bimberi> rajeev: open a terminal and type:  gst-register-0.8
[10:18] <cubikdice> sibblegp, well thast wierd
[10:18] <sibblegp> cubikdice, I know!  I don't know what to do or think.  I've tried reinstalling and such
[10:19] <sybariten> ok i have a problem with a program that wont install over apt ... and even if this may boil down to me having a too old PPC version, i still dont understand why it cant get a library in. The tool seems to rely on libgda2-common, but when i try to install that apt says "its already the latest version"
[10:19] <NoUse> !tell Manika about amarok
[10:19] <sybariten> is this a common apt problem?
[10:19] <adambrady> NoUse I tried reinstalling the cdrecord package again but I still get the same error and a blank disc at the end of recording
[10:19] <sybariten> i mean, when it seems as you need a package, but it also seems as you have it
[10:19] <racestoapril1> gosh, NoUse, i don't know how to get that
[10:20] <luishhc> i want to automount windows when start ubuntu, what i do?
[10:20] <icheyne> !tell icheyne about amarok
[10:20] <bimberi> Warbo: apt-get has one:   apt-get install --reinstall somepackage    - that won't do configs though.  I think you have to purge and reinstall
[10:20] <racestoapril1> how do i get the/etc/apt/sources.list
[10:20] <synd`> Where is the list of supported wireless cards for Ubuntu?
[10:20] <Manika> NoUse: I checked that already... but can't do it :S
[10:21] <bimberi> sybariten: the program probabaly wants a later version which isn't currently available in your repositories
[10:21] <Warbo> bimberi: That is exactly what I cannot do. The --reinstall option is useless to me. I know there is an option to do this with dpkg as I've done it once before, but I forgot it
[10:21] <NoUse> Manika why not?
[10:21] <rajeev> bimberi, thnx but after runnin the gst-register when i open my volume control then it says that"No volume control elements and/or devices found" so what to do next?

Possibly related: when I print to PS from mozilla and run ps2pdf on that it says "Error: Unknown font tag 'R42'" many many times.

[10:33] <bimberi> sybariten: pastebin your sources.list and the output from 'apt-cache policy libgda2-common'

[10:37] <rajeev> crimsun, ok
[10:37] <bimberi> sybariten: ah, kk :)
[10:37] <ranpha> warid can't i use samba like network neighboorhoud like windows?
[10:37] <synd`> Where is the list of supported wireless cards for Ubuntu?
[10:37] <bimberi> !wireless
[10:37] <ubotu> rumour has it, wireless is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCards if it does not work out of the box https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper windows drivers
[10:37] <icheyne> synd`, try the wiki
[10:37] <phreeza> ranpha, if you feel like experimenting check out fusesmb it does something like that
[10:37] <bimberi> synd`: ^^^^^ (first link)
[10:38] <synd`> Thanks, bimberi
[10:38] <bimberi> synd`: np :)
[10:38] <sybariten> bimberi: okay lets see, i put them in the same paste:   http://pastebin.ca/58466   the sources come first.
[10:38] <phreeza> it's not in apt-get though as far as i know, ranpha
[10:38] <adambrady> Kyral_Laptop LOL ok so I got Graveman and gave it a shot. 2 seconds after hitting the Write Tracks button I get a pop up that says Operation Failed
[10:38] <ranpha> phreeza: what do you mean with experimenting?
[10:38] <NoUse> oprime wine needs a chrooted environment to work in AMD64
=== bw_hb|afk is now known as bw_hb
[10:39] <NoUse> !tell oprime about chroot
[10:39] <rajeev> crimsun, here is my output crimsun http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14558
[10:39] <phreeza> ranpha: setting up beta software essentially, compiling sources, tec
[10:39] <phreeza> etc*
[10:40] <crimsun> rajeev: ok, sec
[10:40] <oprime> NoUse: Thanx, I'll try that out.
[10:40] <ranpha> phreeza: okay that a no no then.
[10:40] <Stormx2> Guys, is there like, some printer management tool? That can send jobs like cleaning rollers and stuff to the printer?
[10:40] <crimsun> rajeev: are you using breezy or dapper?
[10:40] <phreeza> ranpha: http://www.ricardis.tudelft.nl/~vincent/fusesmb/
[10:40] <Stormx2> I can't reboot damn this is a such a predicament
[10:41] <rajeev> crimsun, i m using breezy
[10:41] <bthornton> People using wireless at home: have any of you opted to connect to your home network via VPN (instead of using WPA/WEP)?  (feel free to forward me to the correct channel if this is irrelevant here)
[10:41] <phreeza> ranpha: you'll need the fuse headers, etc, they are in apt i think
[10:42] <crimsun> rajeev: please try dapper; your audio chipset is supported much better
[10:42] <captine> bthornton: if you get a response, please let me know.  am interested in vpn :)
[10:42] <rajeev> crimsun: dapper is not available in INDIA so from where i can get that..
[10:43] <erik_m> bthornton : hi what do you mean by vpn (i know what vpn is:D ) but how you intend it configured ?
[10:43] <bimberi> sybariten: that is wierd, have you done a "sudo apt-get update" recently?
[10:43] <carlos_> hello something work with openwrt?
[10:43] <exmethix> jemand in deutsch hier?
[10:44] <bw_hb> exmethix, #ubuntu-de
[10:44] <exmethix> thx
[10:44] <lukketto> vpn: virtual private network
[10:44] <crimsun> rajeev: the release candidate (RC) for dapper will be available shortly
[10:44] <crimsun> rajeev: you can download that soon
[10:44] <sybariten> bimberi: yeah, i believe i did that just after commenting out some stuff in the sources 15 minutes ago ... but i could try again
[10:44] <I_Eat_Plastic> how do you access your shared network folders for a specific computer??
[10:44] <bthornton> erik_m: well, for instance, at my school we have unrestricted wireless access--anybody can connect to any WAP on campus and get an IP.  But, in order to do anything useful (i.e. connect to the Internet), you must authenticate against and open a VPN.  Thus, the connection is encrypted and secure, but there is no need for hardware-level WPA/WEP.
[10:45] <dou213> hey guys, how can i set in mirc that nobody can see my info? wasn't it something with /mode +x?
[10:45] <sybariten> bimberi: btw someone said that "ubuntu0.1" looked fishy
[10:46] <rajeev> crimsun: there is no any way to get the sound in breezy? :(
[10:46] <bthornton> I hear that WEP/WPA is very easy to break, and plus I don't want to deal with driver-support for WEP/WPA in Linux, so that's why I'd like to try the VPN route.
[10:46] <crimsun> rajeev: yes, but you'll have to download quite a bit of source code.
[10:46] <julian> how i do to change gdm to kdm
[10:46] <darius_> bthornton: so what is the question?
[10:46] <lukketto> bthor: use mac-address
[10:46] <erik_m> bthornton : ok i know what you mean :D . ive done this on windows using kerio software but cant say i pursude it on linux. on windows it was good but for where i live (middle of nowhere) it was overkill
[10:47] <bthornton> lukketto: That doesn't do anything for data in-transit.
[10:47] <bimberi> sybariten: no that's ok, although i thought it was supposed to be ubuntu1, ubuntu2 ...
[10:47] <darius_> bthornton: OpenVPN has support for both Windows and Linux clients
[10:47] <rajeev> crimsun: yes i m ready to do that.. plz tell me what to do?
[10:47] <phreeza> ranpha:its actually quite neat i have it installed but i rarely use it. it lets you treat smb environment just like ordinary filesystem
[10:48] <darius_> bthornton: protection from replay attacks, etc
[10:48] <phreeza> even better than windows network neighborhood
[10:48] <bthornton> darius_: Ok I'll look that up; thanks
[10:48] <I_Eat_Plastic> how do you access your shared network folders for a specific computer??
[10:48] <bimberi> julian: if kdm is already installed - 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm'  should let you choose it as the default
[10:49] <Warbo> Well, Google is giving me nothing. Does anyone know how to do the equivalent of --purge and install with a single dpkg -i option? I need to completlely reinstall mkinitramfs, but I can't remove it then reinstall (for obvious reasons)
[10:50] <nf4> Hello I was wondering if it was possible  to use dvdrip under amd64 version of ubuntu
[10:50] <sybariten> bimberi: ok ....
[10:50] <Ratzilla> hey, how do i change my computer name?
[10:51] <Warbo> Ratzilla: hostname
[10:51] <crimsun> rajeev: I had instruction messaged to you.
[10:51] <sybariten> bimberi: but is the weird thing that it doesnt want to install libgda2-common (or that it complains that it needs it, when at the same time it says it has it) .... or did you see anything else that was weird too ?
[10:51] <crimsun> instructions^
[10:52] <xerophyte> Does anybody here use phpldapadmin, i am not able to login as admin to it , but i can able to login with other ldap admin tools .. does anybody know if i have to change anything to the phpldapadmin with Ubuntu
[10:52] <Ratzilla> Warbo: thanks
[10:53] <bimberi> sybariten: yes, the wierd thing is that it says it says "Depends: libgda2-common (>= 1.1.99-1ubuntu0.1)" and yet you have "1.2.1-2ubuntu2~hoary1" installed
[10:53] <rajeev> crimsun: i got that msg, hey dude can i have ur email id so that if i had some problem then i can mail u please
[10:54] <Warbo> I'll go an ask on #Debian as it is a dpkg question
[10:54] <crimsun> rajeev: my information is on launchpad.
[10:54] <Vixus> 5 hours.
[10:54] <Vixus> The dapper livecd has taken 5 hours and still hasn't shown anything on my screen.
[10:54] <crimsun> rajeev: please don't e-mail me personally for support, since I'm very busy the next couple weeks. Try this channel first.
[10:54] <adambrady> ack I get the same exact issue with Graveman. And NoUse I checked and my cdrecord is in /usr/bin where it is supposed to be.
[10:54] <Vixus> I knew my laptop was slow, but it has loaded other livecds in a couple of seconds
[10:54] <julian> bimberi: and if i want a no-default who would be?
[10:55] <Vixus> Any idea why?
[10:55] <mjcs> lol Vixus. that doesnt sound so good
[10:55] <rajeev> crimsun: ok sir thnx for ur help..
[10:55] <bimberi> julian: no default? - you mean for it to boot to a text login?
[10:55] <Vixus> mjcs: I don't see why it should have taken so long. It had reached the splashscreen before I left.
[10:56] <Vixus> mjcs: Now there's just a mouse cursor that has really delayed responses.
[10:56] <mjcs> maybe it loaded all up when you were gone then the screensaver activated and it crashed!
[10:56] <julian> bimberi: a choose for both
[10:56] <Vixus> mjcs: That's probably it-- but why is this livecd so resource intensive?
[10:56] <bostonlow> IS ther a WINE IRC channel I can ask a wine-related question in?
[10:56] <Vixus> bostonlow: #wine
[10:57] <bostonlow> It's empty?
[10:57] <Vixus> ##wine?
[10:57] <bostonlow> Tried that, too
[10:57] <mjcs> Vixus: Ubuntu isn't designed for low resources, Xubuntu is though
[10:57] <bostonlow> There's one person in ##wine
[10:57] <Vixus> bostonlow: #winehq actually
[10:57] <bimberi> julian: no, you need to choose one, but either gdm or kdm will let you log into Gnome or KDE (from the Session menu)
[10:57] <bostonlow> Ahh, thanks Vikus!
[10:57] <icheyne> I want to find out what interface my hard drive uses - is there a linux command I can use?
[10:58] <Vixus> Oh forget this.
[10:58] <rajeev> crimsun: after that wat i have to do?
[10:58] <crimsun> rajeev: reboot.
[10:58] <Vixus> Why is Dapper slow?!
[10:58] <redloff_> hi, is Draper Drake beta2 64bit version quite stable at present?
[10:58] <crimsun> rajeev: or, if you're lucky, just log out and back into gnome.
[10:58] <julian> bimberi: ok, thanks
[10:58] <icheyne> ok is there a good system information linux command?
[10:58] <redloff_> dapper drake, I mean
[10:59] <bimberi> julian: yw :)
[10:59] <rajeev> crimsun: can i get the sound after that?? :)
[10:59] <phreeza> icheyne:what type of info?
[10:59] <redloff_> icheyne, lspci, lshw, cat /proc/cpuinfo, cat /proc/meminfo
[10:59] <icheyne> just general info about my hardware
[10:59] <dogafro> i'm trying to set up ac3 dolby digital decoding via spdif input (5.1 analog speaker out) on a sb live 5.1 card - it seems to be downmixing to 2.0...
[11:00] <icheyne> like what kind of graphics card etc
[11:00] <redloff_> lspci
[11:00] <phreeza> ok then lsoci
[11:00] <icheyne> redloff_, I'll try them, thanks
[11:00] <phreeza> lspci
[11:00] <icheyne> cheers
[11:00] <icheyne> :)
[11:00] <Vixus> Will unchecking Quick Boot on my Thinkpad help?
[11:01] <crimsun> rajeev: you should be able to.
=== Pip is now known as xPip
[11:03] <mwe> Vixus: dapper works fine on tp x40 here
[11:03] <mathieu__> what is the name of hte take snapshot command in the default ubuntu dapper gnome menus ?
[11:03] <Vixus> mwe: Does Pentium 2 ring a bell? ;\
[11:03] <Stargazers> Well, I have a very stupid question but where is the "kernel" file? I need that to test copy it to one dir to try to boot linux over NFS drive with PXE but I don't know what is the kernel file...
[11:04] <Vixus> mwe: It's slightly faster now with quick boot disabled
[11:04] <mwe> Vixus: I see
[11:04] <aprominax> ok
[11:05] <mwe> Vixus: I'd think a P2 would be plenty fast for ubuntu provided there are no other bottle necks like too little RAM
[11:05] <Vixus> mwe: How much ram does a 600E have?
[11:05] <meheren> http://pastebin.com/733814 ~ my x server config file. why won't it work??? anyone see anything suspicious/wrong in it???
[11:05] <T`> guys i'm getting flooded with this Falling back to standard locale ("C") by perl in dchroot
[11:05] <sola6662> yo all
[11:05] <T`> anyone know how to fix this?
[11:05] <aprominax> no.. :S
[11:05] <Blissex> meheren: look at the log, not the config file, it will tel you... /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[11:05] <mwe> Vixus: I don't know. free in a terminal should show it
[11:06] <meheren> ok
[11:06] <Vixus> mwe: If I ever get there. :)
[11:06] <mwe> Vixus: heh. I don't know
[11:06] <sola6662> anyone know a safe way to get XGL running?
[11:06] <aprominax> .. can somebody help me with fixing the sun jre 1.5.0_06..?
[11:06] <mwe> !xgl
[11:06] <ubotu> XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/
[11:07] <hollywoodb> aprominax: fixing what exactly
[11:07] <sola6662> oh thx
[11:07] <amphi> Vixus: depends - linux-laptop.net might give you a clue, as might the bios
[11:07] <aprominax> it works fine in the browser.. but i cant start it normally, to use for game server..:S
[11:07] <Stargazers> Is vmlinuz file the "kernel" file? (I meant that wherethat links goes to...)?
[11:07] <mwe> Stargazers: yes
[11:07] <Vixus> amphi: Yeah, I checked it out. It looks like it can load it, but it's just ever so slow. Maybe that's because I have hardly any HDD space and it's accessing from CD?
[11:08] <mwe> Stargazers: /boot/vmlinuz
[11:08] <Stargazers> mwe: Great, thanks
[11:08] <Stargazers> Then I found right file :)
[11:08] <hollywoodb> aprominax: you mean java web start or a .jar file ?
[11:08] <Vixus> amphi: I'll be wiping the HDD and doing a clean install if I can get my USB wifi stick to work.
[11:08] <mwe> Stargazers: waht are you trying to do?
[11:08] <aprominax> hollywoodb: jar
[11:08] <sola6662> the last time i tried to get XGL it messed me up bad i used some guys hackish guild on the forums
[11:08] <hollywoodb> aprominax: 'java -jar <jarfile>' *should* work
[11:09] <sybariten> bimberi: OK ... thanks for taking a look at it!
[11:09] <aprominax> hollywoodb: ill try again..
[11:09] <cubikdice> Everyone with nVidia cards go get the new drivers! :D http://nvidia.com/
[11:09] <disinterested_pe> ok how do i move a file to a dofferent directory
[11:09] <cubikdice> Release 1.0-8762
[11:09] <disinterested_pe> different
[11:09] <hollywoodb> cubikdice: you should use packaged drivers or a howto, not the binaries direct from nvidia
[11:09] <mwe> disinterested_pe: mv
[11:10] <meheren> http://pastebin.com/733814 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/733830 ~my Xorg .log file... im confused... why won't X work???
[11:10] <cubikdice> hollywoodb, uh...there oooold
[11:10] <disinterested_pe> in a terminal?
[11:10] <jhenn> My X bleeds.  Anyone know why?
[11:10] <_nicolas> Is there a way to burn DVDs using burnfree which doesn't require cdrecord-prodvd?
[11:10] <cubikdice> hollywoodb, installed them flawlessly
[11:10] <mwe> disinterested_pe: mv /foo/bar/blah /foo/baz/ in a term, yes
[11:10] <Warbo> hollywood: I walked cubikdice through installing binary drivers a few hours ago so he could use composite with GLX
[11:11] <cubikdice> indeed. but i just noticed there a new version just released :P
[11:11] <Warbo> cubikdice: I don't recommend using the nvidia.com drivers, and neither should you
[11:11] <cubikdice> oh?
[11:11] <disinterested_pe> im trying to install fire fox 1.5.0.3 tar bz
[11:11] <Warbo> cubikdice: Your situation needed them
[11:11] <meheren>  http://pastebin.com/733814 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/733830 ~my Xorg .log file... im confused... why won't X work??? it says it's not configured properely...?
[11:11] <cubikdice> basicly just letting people who might be interested know
[11:11] <hollywoodb> there are howtos in the forums on properly installing latest drivers, generally the binaries straight from nvidia are a bad idea
[11:12] <mwe> disinterested_pe: read the firefoxnewversion wiki
[11:12] <mwe> !tell disinterested_pe about ff1.5
[11:12] <Schalken> Hi!
[11:13] <trpr42> hollywood: because of user error right? better to recommend a newbie friendly solution than set someone up for a hassle
[11:13] <Schalken> ???
[11:13] <mwe> !!!
[11:13] <ubotu> mwe: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[11:13] <Vixus> We have mouse movement!
[11:14] <meheren>  http://pastebin.com/733814 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/733830 ~my Xorg .log file can anyone tell me what's wrong..?
[11:14] <hollywoodb> trpr42: no, they basically package their own versions of X libs & overwrite them
[11:14] <ndlovu> hi all. Here's the situation: I have a computer with no hard drive booted with the live cd. It has a dvd writer and I would like to write something off the network. Can this work?
[11:14] <ndlovu> or will it need a hard drive to copy stuff to locally?
[11:14] <trpr42> hollywood: there is a better way then? let the package managers mangle it into something friendly? the replacement is occuring when you compile your own drivers?
[11:15] <trpr42> hollywood: or only when you use one of their precompiled drivers
[11:15] <meheren> http://pastebin.com/733814 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/733830 ~my Xorg .log file can anyone tell me what's wrong..?
[11:15] <hollywoodb> trpr42: yep, that's the reason there's an nvidia-glx package instead of a howto that says go to nvidia.com
[11:15] <crazy_penguin> night all! pleasent dreams!
[11:16] <hollywoodb> trpr42: there's a long forum thread on it, but I don't have a browser handy right now to find it
[11:16] <aprominax> hollywoodb: java: i get errors :S : exception in tread " main" java.lang.noclassdeffound..
[11:16] <trpr42> hollywood: i'll take your word for it.. i have just experienced nothing but trouble with the packages provided and have always had to go out and compile my own driver
[11:17] <Ratzilla> is suspend 2 part of ubuntu?
[11:17] <linchris> My computer hangs when I try to boot the 2.6.15-23 kernel that I got with depper.. :(
[11:17] <Flannel> linchris: #ubuntu+1
[11:17] <linchris> ubuntu+1? :)
[11:17] <hollywoodb> trpr42: usually it isn't a problem, and for some ppl nothing works better than nvidia.com's drivers
[11:17] <jonatan> ndlovu: can you maybe create a ramdisk ?
[11:17] <linchris> aha ic :P
[11:17] <Ratzilla> is dapper out officially? i cant find it
[11:17] <hollywoodb> trpr42: but if you run into a GLX bug using them you're kind of out of luck
[11:18] <Manika> Ratzilla: it'll be released in early June
[11:18] <meheren> http://pastebin.com/733814 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/733830 ~my Xorg .log file can anyone tell me what's wrong..?
[11:18] <mjcs> Ratzilla: not officially
[11:18] <trpr42> hollywood: i am going to be more wary now after hearing all that business about replacing X libraries.
[11:18] <hollywoodb> aprominax: have you tried blackdown ? I've never had a problem with sun, if you're sure the jar file is fine
[11:18] <Ratzilla> oh okay, :) is it ever possible to upgrade from breezy -> dapper or would i have to uninstall/reinstall/
[11:18] <meheren> Ratzilla, do  apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:18] <mjcs> Ratzilla: you can just upgrade straight to dapper
[11:19] <Ratzilla> oooooooh awesome :)
[11:19] <meheren> of course run as root or use sudo
[11:19] <jonatan> Ratzilla: it will officially be released in june, but you can get the beta version and packages that are currently developed, you may want to try #ubuntu+1 for more information
[11:19] <mjcs> Ratzilla: but i'd recommend a fresh install from my experience
[11:19] <sloncho> hi. sudo / sudoers q: I have this: http://pastebin.com/733724. The idea is, that the firewall script can be executed by fwadmin members w/o password, and %wheel users can exec everything, but with passowrd. my user is member to both groups, and is required password even for the fw script. What is wrong, why I can not execute the fw script w/o password?
[11:19] <Vixus> Window Manager
[11:20] <Ratzilla> i guess ill wait till dapper comes out officially :) thanks
[11:20] <aprominax> hollywoodb: im 90% sure the jar works fine.. andi havn't tried blackdown
[11:20] <ndlovu> is there some way to use piping in a clever way so that I can write a dvd over the network without needing any local hard drive space?
[11:20] <jonatan> Ratzilla, heh, I tried Flight 7, it didn't quite like some of my hardware ( wireless card in particular ) so I'm waiting as well
[11:20] <trpr42> aprominax: you put it in your classpath? export CLASSPATH:/new/jar.jar:$CLASSPATH
[11:21] <ramvi> What's up with the new xgl/compiz update? It was yesterdays or todays... Xgl stoped working :( Have anyone else experienced problems?
[11:21] <trpr42> aprominax: an equals sign missing after that first CLASSPATH
[11:21] <ndlovu> jonatan: sorry, missed your comment. ramdisk would work, but doesn't that need lots of memory? I have way less memory than I need to write to dvd.
[11:21] <Ratzilla> jonatan: my wireless card didnt work either..but ive got it set up now..so ill just save the conf files :)
[11:22] <kane777> g'nite everybody...

[11:23] <Bicou> Hello. I have 2 comps, both running VNC servers. On one comp I try to use vncviewer on localhost, but I can't get the thing to work... On the 2nd comp it works perfectly. Check the log: http://pastebin.com/733858

[11:23] <ubuntu> DBO: how's it going
[11:23] <dtrinh> :D
[11:24] <jonatan> Ratzilla: that may not work depending on what drivers you are using. If you are using ndiswrapper you will almost certainly have to set it up again
[11:24] <csibepapa> hy all
[11:25] <jonatan> ndlovu, not all burning software need a full iso on the harddrive, but they may or may not want to use it as a buffer

[11:26] <andrejkw> Sometimes it freezes later and soemtimes right in the beginning.
[11:27] <jonatan> andrejkw, what are you using for the transfer ?
[11:27] <ndlovu> jonatan: the nautilus writer seems to want to have the full iso in memory at least before it starts writing. I'm not sure what other writers come with the live cd or if it's possible to "install" new software on the live cd?
[11:28] <andrejkw> jonathan: gnome-bluetooth
[11:28] <meheren> chowells, sooo any suggestions on how to fix it?
[11:28] <andrejkw> jonathan: I installed that package, and I am using the "Bluetooth File Sharing" option in the menu
[11:28] <chowells> meheren: comment out the sectin referencing /dev/wacom

[11:29] <Ratzilla> how do i get hibernation to work properly? i installed hibernate...but that didnt seem to do anything..
[11:29] <meheren> oh lol ok
[11:29] <meheren> on the .conf file?
[11:29] <jonatan> ndlovu, if it requires a full iso in temp you will probably not be able to use that software unless you have enough memory for a ramdisk. I dunno what software comes on the livecd.
[11:30] <rajeev> crimsun: i recieved an error msg after that..:(
[11:30] <jonatan> ndlovu: having said that, I think the nautilus burner is just a warpper for the command line software, so you might be able to get arround that by doing it manually
[11:30] <chamo> hello
[11:31] <rajeev> crimsun: ok i crossed my fingure n going to reboot my machine..
[11:31] <Bicou> no clue?!
[11:31] <kuitang> psh, y would u want to burn w/ nautilus?
[11:31] <Bicou> please :d
[11:31] <ndlovu> jonatan: that is an interesting point
[11:31] <sola6662> well brb i think i hope it setup right
[11:31] <kuitang> just use cdrecord from cmdline
[11:32] <mish4> any of you use conky?
[11:32] <Hentai_Jeff|stud> hey does anyone know of any good, cheap, linux compatable USB 2.0 cards?
[11:32] <mish4> i keep getting segmentation fault
[11:32] <jonatan> ndlovu, heck , for all I know nautilus might have some settings letting you do it ( I use KDE so I wouldn't know )
=== Hentai_Jeff|stud is now known as Hentai_Jeff
[11:32] <ndlovu> kuitang: any idea how I could use cdrecord to record something over the network?
[11:33] <ndlovu> jonatan: there don't seem to be too many options, but I'll check it out...
[11:34] <Hentai_Jeff> anyone?

[11:37] <Hentai_Jeff> it means weird >.<
[11:37] <mjcs> am i the only one who thinks OS-X is ugly?
[11:37] <Hentai_Jeff> no you're not mjcs
[11:38] <Hentai_Jeff> it's not only ugly
[11:38] <Tuzlo> hey, need some opinions. CMS systems. Ease of use for users and administrator. Whats the best.
[11:38] <Vixus> mjcs: It's not as beautiful as my windows.

[11:39] <tHeDvL> tftpd-hpa - HPA's tftp client
[11:39] <Tuzlo> Vixus: not too much, but ability to add on components would be nice
[11:39] <mjcs> tHeDvL: which one do you think it would be?!
[11:39] <tHeDvL> so Blissex what should i do?
[11:39] <Vixus> Tuzlo: Go for a blogging tool, like Wordpress then.
[11:39] <sola6662> #compiz
[11:39] <calamari> every once in a while I see a program appear on the taskbar, called "Launching HTTP Cache Cleaner".. what is this?  Is it a virus?
[11:39] <Vixus> haha
[11:39] <tHeDvL> mjcs: the first?
[11:39] <Tuzlo> Vixus: sucks, it needs php4 and I need 5 for something else
[11:39] <Vixus> uh
[11:39] <Blissex> tHeDvL: you install that package...
[11:39] <Some_Person> I cant boot the live cd
[11:39] <pau_> some one knows how set up a canon lpb 800 printer?
[11:39] <mjcs> tHeDvL: looks good to me, how about you?
[11:40] <sola6662> can some1 help me get compiz?
[11:40] <Some_Person> i get some error about X something can't display
[11:40] <Some_Person> (I am a noobie at linux)
[11:40] <Hentai_Jeff> a good deal of us here are
[11:40] <Vixus> Tuzlo: No idea
[11:40] <fightp1> Some_Person, maybe your graphics card is not supported
[11:40] <sola6662> welcome to the club some
[11:40] <Tuzlo> i should recheck that and see what requires 5
[11:41] <aprominax> does anybody know a good tutorial for unix commands?
[11:41] <Some_Person> hell
[11:41] <Some_Person> i really wanted ubunty
[11:41] <jhenn> does anyone know how to get composite running in ubuntu?
[11:41] <NoUse> !tell aprominax about cli
[11:41] <fightp1> Some_Person, what VGA card do you have?
[11:41] <pau_> to see tutorial use man or info
[11:41] <Blissex> jhenn: somebody does... But leave it alone.
[11:42] <calamari> aprominax: well, it's not spectacular, bu there is the Debian GNU/Linux Reference Card
[11:42] <Tuzlo> Vixus: is it easy to configure, I couldnt for the life of me figure out joolma's froint page
[11:42] <jhenn> Blissex: why?
[11:42] <Some_Person> GeForce 6100 Nvidia
[11:42] <about> this kubuntu looks real cool... it needs a little tweaking in the setting .. and it become extra stylish
[11:42] <fightp1> Some_Person, sound quite new
[11:42] <sola6662> man now i need a new card?
[11:42] <Vixus> Tuzlo: Wordpress is easy to configure I guess. It depends on how you want your site to look.
[11:43] <iNiku> hmm, anyone using an MD (RAID) device for root? what's wrong when a 2.6 kernel won't autodetect the RAID but a 2.4 kernel will?
[11:43] <calamari> aprominax: http://people.debian.org/~debacle/refcard
[11:43] <Tuzlo> I dont think I need php 5 for what I have installed right now, I should switch to 4
[11:43] <Some_Person> I bought my computer a few days ago
[11:43] <NoUse> Some_Person try installing the nvidia drivers via the wiki page ubotu will send you
[11:43] <Blissex> iNiku: vaguely remembering that the MD stuff is a bit different between 2.4 and 2.6...
[11:43] <Some_Person> I got ubuntu to go with it
[11:43] <NoUse> !tell Some_Person about nvidia
[11:43] <mcdonaldsguy> I have a directory DIR and a symlink to it SYM... within gnome-terminal, if I'm in SYM and I open up a new tab, the new tab starts me off in DIR rather than SYM.  Is this a feature or a bug?
[11:43] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: feature.
[11:44] <fightp1> Some_person, did you ever get Ubuntu working on it? 5.10 maybe?
[11:44] <sola6662> can  anyone link me so i can get Compiz?
[11:44] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: why?
[11:44] <mish4> somoene help me with conky
[11:44] <mish4> please...
[11:44] <disinterested_pe> how do i install firefox 1.5.0.3?
[11:44] <iNiku> Blissex: an MD device created on 2.4 should be usable on 2.6 though, right?
[11:44] <Some_Person> i have the 5.10 pressed cd
[11:44] <iNiku> Blissex: and in fact it is, if I boot from an ubuntu live CD
[11:44] <Blissex> iNiku: yes, bit in a slightly different way IIRC.
[11:44] <pau_> it's possible use a canon lpb-800 in ubuntu?
[11:44] <disinterested_pe> im @ the wiki site and nothing works
[11:44] <NoUse> !tell disinterested_pe about ff1.5
[11:44] <iNiku> but for some reason the boot-time autodetection isn't working so it cannot mount root
[11:44] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: because you are really in 'DIR'...
[11:44] <jjazz> disinterested_pe: It's in dapper
[11:44] <NoUse> disinterested_pe don't be too specific or anything
[11:44] <fightp1> some_person, somebody is telling me that you might need to replace nv driver for vesa driver
[11:45] <green_earz> iNiku: did you build the kernel your self ?
[11:45] <mcdonaldsguy> but "pwd" in SYM doesn't return DIR...
[11:45] <Some_Person> I need to use the livecd to partition my HD.
[11:45] <GoLoGo> i am trying to install ubuntu on my primary master hardrive 20.2gb - windows currently tells me im only using up 8.6gb - i am using the amd64 install cd dapper drake - i keep trying to resize my only partition on my primary hardrive to 9gb - ubuntu keeps telling me it failed, that there is not enough freespace to install ubuntu - then i tried manually, and its not working - i need help
[11:45] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: try this: '(mkdir /tmp/a; ln -s /tmp/a /tmp/b; cd /tmp/b; pwd, dirs; /bin/pwd'
[11:45] <iNiku> green_earz: yes, with the required drivers compiled in
[11:45] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: try this: '(mkdir /tmp/a; ln -s /tmp/a /tmp/b; cd /tmp/b; pwd; dirs; /bin/pwd'
[11:45] <fightp1> some_person, if you can log in you can sudo vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf  to replace that string
[11:45] <aprominax> calamari: Ty
[11:45] <Some_Person> once i partition i will install ubuntu
[11:46] <Some_Person> btw, i have no flippy drive
[11:46] <pau_> it's possible use a canon lpb-800 in ubuntu?
[11:46] <Hentai_Jeff> what's a flippy drive? :P
[11:46] <iNiku> green_earz: why, you have some ideas?
[11:46] <Blissex> pau_: try http://WWW.Linux-printing.org/
[11:46] <Some_Person> floppy drive
[11:46] <jonatan> GoLoGo: the think the Ubuntu Installer tells you what the minimum size you can make the partition should be
[11:47] <majd> hi, sound juicer isn't picking up an audio cd
[11:47] <jonatan> GoLoGo: what does it say ?
[11:47] <Hentai_Jeff> is it the next generation of floppy drives?
[11:47] <Some_Person> lol
[11:47] <green_earz> iNiku: when i built  my own i could not upgrade with out problems. when i used the installer the build the md raid, i had no problems in upgrading.
[11:47] <jonatan> GoLoGo: also, I'd really reccomend getting another harddrive for a dual boot system 20gb is not all that much
[11:47] <majd> ok....nvm it just did
[11:47] <Blissex> Hentai_Jeff: no, it is a drive that you have to turn over to read every other block... :-)
[11:47] <majd> wtf
[11:47] <Some_Person> so, any ways i can boot the livecd?
[11:48] <acke> Hey, im on a laptop. the mouse pad moves my mouse to fast.... I have tried to change the mouse speed in the mouse setting in preferences. but the speed is unaffeced. How can i change the mouse pad speed of the mouse????
[11:48] <Hentai_Jeff> lol
[11:48] <GoLoGo> when im using the guided partitioning option - tells me min. is 512mb max is 20.2gb - by default the size that it wanted to resize my partition to was 10.2gb - but even that failed
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: hm, I'm scratching my head as to why this behavior is a feature:
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> wchow@milhouse:~$ cd temp/SYM
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> wchow@milhouse:~/temp/SYM$ which pwd
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> /bin/pwd
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> wchow@milhouse:~/temp/SYM$ pwd
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> /home/wchow/temp/SYM
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> wchow@milhouse:~/temp/SYM$ /bin/pwd
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> /home/wchow/temp/DIR
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> wchow@milhouse:~/temp/SYM$
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> er
[11:48] <mcdonaldsguy> sorry about that paste
[11:48] <NoUse> mcdonaldsguy don't paste in here
[11:48] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: thats exactly how it should be...
[11:48] <iNiku> green_earz: hmm. well I still don't see why it won't recognize the MD device
[11:48] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: try this: 'type pwd; type /bin/pwd'
[11:49] <green_earz> iNiku: the problems where soming to do with i think called the init ram image ?
[11:49] <GoLoGo> anyone know the minimum size of space needed for an ubuntu installation using amd64 dapper drake?
[11:49] <mcdonaldsguy> ah I see
[11:49] <mcdonaldsguy> ok
[11:49] <acke> Hey, im on a laptop. the mouse pad moves my mouse to fast.... I have tried to change the mouse speed in the mouse setting in preferences. but the speed is unaffeced. How can i change the mouse pad speed of the mouse?
[11:49] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: and ask yourself: ''why do 'dirs' and 'pwd' always agree?'
[11:49] <jonatan> GoLoGo: hmmm, that seems odd. I used the manual partition tho, doesn't really know how the guided one works
[11:49] <GoLoGo> the manual partition doesnt work for me either, it does not do anything....
[11:49] <Rhine> When i run Rhythmbox it crashes and spits out this messag Attempt to remove filter function 0xb7f42721 user data 0x832c380, but no such filter has been added
[11:49] <kbrooks> how do I reinstall breezy?
[11:49] <micktm> Hi! can I use Gnome Pilot Settings to connect the mobile with IR?
[11:49] <green_earz> iNiku: the installer builds a kernel md friendly ram image
[11:50] <jonatan> what do you mean? Does it give you an error?
[11:50] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: now, to enlighten you further, do this: 'mkdir /tmp/x; cd /tmp/x; rmdir /tmp/x; pwd; /bin/pwd'
[11:50] <kbrooks> i have lots of personal stuff.
[11:50] <Rhine> Yes it gives me an error and it says "restart" "close" "inform devolopers"
[11:50] <nickrud> kbrooks, is home on another paritition?
[11:51] <kbrooks> nickrud: no :(
[11:51] <nickrud> kbrooks, cdwritin' time
[11:51] <jonatan> GoLoGo: what exactly do you mean when you say that the manual partitioner doesn't do anything? It normally doesn't try to repartition the disk until after you have told it all the changes you want and asked it to go to the next step.
[11:51] <iNiku> green_earz: but that shouldn't make a difference if I have the MD stuff compiled in? it does try to autodetect RAID arrays but doesn't find anything... and if I specify it on the kernel command line, it fails
[11:51] <kbrooks> nickrud: no cds here.
[11:51] <micktm> Which is the command I must use to acrivate the IRda?
[11:51] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: please also summarize your deductions here after the latest experiments...
[11:51] <iNiku> green_earz: do you happen to know what exactly 2.6 does differently when it comes to MD devices?
[11:51] <GoLoGo> alright im going to experiment some more... then i will come back with my findings, thanks jonatan
[11:52] <amphi> acke: xset perhaps
[11:52] <jonatan> GoLoGo: no problem, tho I'm not sure exactly what you meant
[11:52] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: I'm guessing that since dirs and pwd are shell builtins, it's returning what the shell thinks my current directory is
[11:52] <GoLoGo> well the thing is i choose the size i want manually for the hardrive, then i click on the apply changes on the bottom
[11:52] <GoLoGo> and it doesnt do anything
[11:52] <mcdonaldsguy> but that /bin/pwd does something else..
[11:52] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: thats mostly correct... But incomplete
[11:52] <Some_Person> how do i use nvidia drivers with livecd?
[11:52] <redguy> !update
[11:52] <jonatan> GoLoGo: what does it do when you try to proceed to the next step of teh installation ?
[11:52] <ubotu> redguy: Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[11:53] <mcdonaldsguy> I've sort of seen behavior like that before with the emacs shell.. sometimes it gets confused as to which directory I'm actually in
[11:53] <Ratzilla> where is a good place to get free widescreen wallpaper?
[11:53] <GoLoGo> nothing
[11:53] <redguy> !upgrade
[11:53] <GoLoGo> just stays on the same screen
[11:53] <iNiku> in fact, it won't even boot if I specify one of the mirror halves directly as the root device
[11:53] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: but I don't know the mechanism that /bin/pwd is using
[11:53] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: the shell keeps a stack of directory _names_. But '/bin/pwd' will traverse the actual filesystem using '..' to find out what the current directory is,
[11:53] <jonatan> GoLoGo: ok that is /really/ weird
[11:53] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: ah I see
[11:53] <Some_Person> shutup, ubotu
[11:53] <kbrooks> hmm.
[11:53] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: try this: 'strace -e trace=file /bin/pwd'
[11:53] <Some_Person> now, how do i boot my livecd using my nvidia geforce 6100?
[11:54] <green_earz> iNiku : so you build the 2.4 and all ok but when you build 2.6 the kernel fails. do you use make oldconfig before the compile. there may be a small eliment missing
[11:54] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: but in the case of opening up a new tab... why would it be preferable to not use what the shell thinks?
[11:54] <jonatan> GoLoGo: anyway, if you just have 20Gb I'd suggest you get another HD.
[11:54] <Some_Person> Hello?
[11:54] <redguy> does update manager do anything more than sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list > /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[11:54] <Some_Person> How do i boot my livecd using my nvidia geforce 610
[11:54] <GoLoGo> i do have another hardrive its a 200gb
[11:54] <GoLoGo> but its a slave
[11:54] <jonatan> Oh
[11:54] <Some_Person> And I have no floppy drive
[11:54] <nickrud> kbrooks, maybe you could do something fancy with a live cd and rsizing & parititions, but I'd borrow a hard drive someone
[11:54] <ndlovu> okay, if I've "mounted" a network share with nautilus, is there some way to access it from the commandline?
[11:55] <Some_Person> any help?
[11:55] <ranpha> why does linux need to be root when you mount a network share or external USB disk???
[11:55] <Vixus> argh
[11:55] <GoLoGo> if i made space on my 200gb hd, would i still be able to do dual boot even if its slave?
[11:55] <Vixus> still no desktop
[11:55] <mjcs> Some_Person: put it in your CD drive and reboot
[11:55] <kbrooks> nickrud: i have 2 HDs
[11:55] <jonatan> GoLoGo: thats ok, the master/slave thing just deals with how the harddrives are connected, you should be able to boot from it anyway
[11:55] <gordonjcp> ranpha: because you've got it misconfigured?
[11:55] <mjcs> ranpha: it doesn't, set up fstab with user options
[11:55] <o3w1sh3z> hello
[11:55] <o3w1sh3z> i need help
[11:55] <GoLoGo> what do you suggest i do, if i think my partition table is damage for my 200gb hd?
[11:55] <nickrud> kbrooks, there you go then. make a partition on the second drive, move everything there you want to save. Then repartition the first & install
[11:55] <o3w1sh3z> does any one know how to burn A CD+G
[11:55] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: when you open a new tab presumably the shell initializes itself by using '..' traversal. The stack of directory names in one shell cannot be exported to another shell (or perhaps it can, but it is not done usually)
[11:56] <jonatan> GoLoGo: basically the master/slave configuration is there so that you can use a single cable for both harddrives.
[11:56] <green_earz> iNiku : by the way i run a 2.6 raid 1 from a installer build so the 2.6 is ok with md
[11:56] <Vixus> hmm 128MB ram
[11:56] <GoLoGo> on ubuntu it tells me i have 4, when i only have 2 on windows....
[11:56] <Some_Person> Hello?
[11:56] <Vixus> :D
[11:56] <Some_Person> Anyone here to help ME?
[11:56] <Vixus> Is 128MB not enough, then?
[11:56] <mjcs> lol Vixus!
[11:56] <Vixus> XD
[11:56] <ranpha> Misconfigured??? it's a standaard ubuntu install.  and how can i modified this?
[11:56] <soundray> Some_Person: not unless you ask a question
[11:56] <mjcs> To run the live CD?
[11:56] <sola6662> vixus u get my pm
[11:56] <kbrooks> nickrud: uh, never mind :P
[11:56] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: but the behavior when I start xterm is the opposite
[11:56] <Vixus> mjcs: yeah
[11:56] <jonatan> GoLoGo: that is probably the number of partitions, as opposed to the number of harddrives
[11:56] <Vixus> sola6662: No
[11:56] <mjcs> i think its the bare minimum
[11:56] <sola6662> oh
[11:56] <jonatan> GoLoGo: do you have separate partitions for swap maybe ?
[11:56] <carlos_> tred
[11:56] <mjcs> aka. not enough
[11:57] <sola6662> i wanted to know how can i get compiz?
[11:57] <iNiku> green_earz: I have a feeling it has something to do with the fact that this MD was created under 2.4
[11:57] <GoLoGo> i will just try once more....
[11:57] <GoLoGo> thanks
[11:57] <soundray> !tell sola6662 about xgl
[11:57] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: depends on which mode the shell is in when it starts, and how it is invoked.
[11:57] <Vixus> mjcs: Is it enough to run Ubuntu natively then?
[11:57] <jjazz> sola6662: It's in dapper
[11:57] <sola6662> hmmm
[11:57] <sarah> 128mb is enough ram to run.. but ram is cheap.. 256 is better
[11:57] <mjcs> Vixus: should be, you might want to look at Xubuntu if you want a decent performance though
[11:57] <Vixus> I've got a laptop
[11:58] <jjazz> sola6662: dapper universe, to be more specific
[11:58] <sola6662> so in order to get compiz i need to get dapper right?
[11:58] <Vixus> mjcs: I just want a good OS for my laptop, I've got an old clogged copy of windows 2000.
[11:58] <Archville> sola6662: or update from breezy to dapper
[11:58] <mjcs> I have 512mb ram chips for a laptop spare..
[11:58] <soundray> sola6662: anything else would be a pain
[11:58] <jjazz> sola6662: No, you just need that one package.
[11:58] <sola6662> oh i seen
[11:58] <nickrud> Vixus, you might like xubuntu better, it has a smaller footprint
[11:59] <mjcs> Vixus: have a look at xubuntu then, www.xubuntu.org its just ubuntu with xfce
[11:59] <floydwil1e> how to upgrade from breezy to dapper please splain
[11:59] <Vixus> Maybe I should just buy a new laptop. :P
[11:59] <mjcs> lol or that!
[11:59] <soundray> !tell floydwil1e about upgrade
[11:59] <kuitang> ya, they'll hav a ubuntu for every wm
[11:59] <jjazz> sola6662: Happily, I don't think it has any dapper depends, so you can just dload the deb and then dpkg -i it.
[11:59] <floydwil1e> I look here: wiki.ubuntu.com/Dapperupgrades doesn't make sense
[11:59] <mjcs> kuitang: and if they don't, you can just build it yourself :)
[12:00] <jjazz> floydwil1e: Add dapper repositories and then apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:00] <sola6662> jjazz sorry for the noobish but whats the deb?
[12:00] <soundray> jjazz: why are you saying this? You can't sensibly put compiz on breezy without major hassle
[12:00] <soundray> floydwil1e: read the message from ubotu
[12:00] <jjazz> soundray: I'm just talking about installing the package.
[12:01] <soundray> sola6662: don't listen to jjazz. You can probably install compiz, but it's pointless without Xgl. Upgrade to dapper to get Xgl is my advice.
[12:01] <soundray> sola6662: read the pm that ubotu sent you.
[12:02] <joe__> How can I get my pc to boot windows xp if I installed linux second?
[12:02] <metrocard> hi all
[12:02] <jonatan> floydwil1e: you shoudl have a configuration file at /etc/apt/sources.list it basically tells your package manager where to get its packages from. Everywhere that file sais "breezy" change it to "dapper" then do "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[12:02] <floydwil1e> why does it say use gksudo?
[12:02] <Vixus> mjcs: Thanks I'll give it a shot
[12:02] <mfb__> !gksudo
[12:02] <ubotu> Use gksudo to run gtk applications with root privileges. Using sudo to start gtk apps can scramble your user account permissions.
[12:02] <majd> is vista only available to subscribers?
[12:02] <majd> oh shite...wrong channel
[12:02] <soundray> joe__: select Windows from the grub menu. That shows early in the boot phase (you may have to hit Esc to see it)
[12:03] <mfb__> soundray> no need to hit Esc with multiple OSes, the GRUB menu appears anyway
[12:03] <jjazz> sola6662: You can find packages and look at their depends at packages.ubuntu.com.  You can get .deb files there too.  .deb files are the package files that apt-get usually downloads and installs for you.
[12:03] <joe__> soundray: I've tried that, windows isn't an option
[12:03] <felipe__> I'm trying to intall Enemy Territory and each time a run the installer my computer turns off. Any ideas on how to fix this?
[12:03] <astrisk> i m not getting my video output upto the mark this could be due to i didnt have correct graphic driver so can any one tell me how to install correct graphic driver, my graphics card is of VIA
[12:03] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: any idea off the top of your head how I might find out if the symlink thing is configurable with gnome-terminal? I'm not totally sure what I should be googling for
[12:04] <tuxedup> i have a question about wireless adapters on ubuntu 6.06.  I have a DWL-G122 that can use the RT2500 driver, is this included in the base system of ubuntu 6.06 by anychance?
[12:04] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: probably not configurable.
[12:04] <soundray> joe__: in that case, you may have to add a "title" section to the end of /boot/grub/menu.lst . The file contains an example (commented out)
[12:04] <Blissex> tuxedup: probably it is included...
[12:04] <floydwil1e> how about if I do sudo passwd root and the apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
[12:04] <sarah> Vixus: A good os on a laptop? Win 2k needs 512 or more, problems with security. A good Linux better
[12:04] <astrisk> i m not getting my video output upto the mark this could be due to i didnt have correct graphic driver so can any one tell me how to install correct graphic driver, my graphics card is of VIA plz help me out
[12:04] <mfb__> floydwil1e> it ssems a bad idea
[12:04] <sola6662> jjazz whats the .deb link?
[12:04] <mfb__> seems*
[12:04] <mocker> Can anyone tell me what package contains an X configuration tool?
[12:05] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: hm, ok.. that's annoying since I have some pretty long pathnames that I've symlinked..
[12:05] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: ok, thanks for the help
[12:05] <mocker> Just install dapper and X isn't wanting to start. ;)
[12:05] <sola6662> omg why is X-Chat clocking pms to me
[12:05] <sola6662> blocking*
[12:05] <mfb__> mocker> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[12:05] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: you can use 'mount --bind' instead of symlinking.
[12:05] <soundray> sola6662: you have to register
[12:05] <[NP] Tangent> oi
[12:05] <soundray> !register
[12:05] <ubotu> Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[12:05] <ompaul> !dapper
[12:05] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[12:05] <mfb__> oh, why do I have this stupid nickname ?
=== mfb__ is now known as HymnToLife
[12:06] <[NP] Tangent> I just tried enabling preempt in the kernel for breezy
[12:06] <[NP] Tangent> and my wireless didn't work
[12:06] <sola6662> oh
[12:06] <[NP] Tangent> any ideas why?
[12:06] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: if you are really obsessed by that. Note you need to rerun 'mount --bind' on every boot.
[12:06] <Some_Person> help me with livecd

[12:06] <HymnToLife> ompaul> ISP disconnection most likely
[12:06] <HymnToLife> but this is supposed to be my third nick
[12:06] <Some_Person> how do i get it to boot (i get error
[12:06] <mcdonaldsguy> Blissex: we dist the symlinks across 50-odd machines, so I don't think the bind would quite work for us
[12:06] <soundray> sola6662: ubotu told you about registering ^^^
[12:06] <sammy> hi can anybody help me i get a kernel panic after resizing my main partition
[12:06] <ompaul> sola6662, ^^up a couple of lines

[12:07] <Blissex> mcdonaldsguy: thats the case...
[12:07] <soundray> jjazz: can you stop this please.
[12:07] <soundray> jjazz: it's pointless, and you are creating support work for us.
[12:07] <Vixus> sarah: Exactly. ;)
[12:07] <Warbo> What filesystem are initrd images? I have tried cramfs and squashfs with no luck (and loop requires a type)

[12:08] <HymnToLife> soon time for bed I guess
[12:08] <sammy> uhu? @ ompaul
[12:08] <sammy> i don't understand
[12:08] <jjazz> sola6662: soundray seems adamant that this won't work, so perhaps you should try his method.
[12:08] <HymnToLife> !tell sammy about justask
[12:08] <astrisk> i m not getting my video output upto the mark this could be due to i didnt have correct graphic driver so can any one tell me how to install correct graphic driver, my graphics card is of VIA
[12:08] <sammy> hi can anybody help me i get a kernel panic after resizing my main partition how can i fix it?
[12:08] <ompaul> sammy, first prefix lines with the users name, that is the best way on IRC, second, If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[12:08] <astrisk> plz help me out by telling how to install draphic driver
[12:09] <joe__> soundray: When I add the title section to menu.lst, do I need to edit the example for it to boot from the right partition, or just leave it as is?
[12:09] <soundray> astrisk: run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select via as your driver.
[12:09] <Warbo> What filesystem are initrd images?
[12:09] <ompaul> astrisk, more info, what kind of graphics card is it?
[12:09] <sammy> ompaul, i aksked twice now ; )
[12:09] <sola6662> cool reg*
[12:10] <soundray> joe__: Windows installs to (hd0,0) by default. I would just try that and see if it works, unless you already know it won't.
[12:10] <astrisk> ompaul, its onboard graphics card of MSI mother board
[12:10] <ompaul> sammy, if you resized and your kernel is bombing out there is something very serious wrong (just a guess)
[12:10] <ompaul> astrisk, have you any graphics at the moment?
[12:10] <sarah> Vixus: if you like to use win2k. Get all updates from MS. Use 512mg+ ram. Or learn Linux Ubuntu is great for anyone.
[12:10] <soundray> sammy: did you resize a mounted partition?
[12:10] <astrisk> ompaul, i dont have any external graphics card
[12:10] <sammy> ompaul, maybe its beacause i resized it under windows with Paragon Partition Manager
[12:10] <gholen> HI! Anyone here to help me with 915resolution?
[12:10] <Warbo> sammy: The only kernel panics I've ever had on Ubuntu are when my filesystem is gone (not turned on my external hard disk)
[12:11] <HymnToLife> anyway, partition resizing is not  conventional Unix process
[12:11] <joe__> soundray:  Alright, I'll try it out
[12:11] <astrisk> ompaul, yes i m running a video song
[12:11] <HymnToLife> so it's not advisable to do it at al, thins might cause problems like you're experiencing now
[12:11] <soundray> sammy: does that program support resizing Linux partitions?
[12:11] <sammy> soundray, yes
[12:11] <soundray> sammy: ext3 as well?
[12:11] <ompaul> sammy, more likely you overwrote something you should not have and have done serious damage to your ubuntu installation, I suggest using a live CD to see if you can mount the partition and rescue any data you want from it, and then do a reinstall
[12:12] <Ratzilla> where can i get widescreen wallpaper?
[12:12] <joeblu> deviantart.org
[12:12] <sammy> I had made my reiserfs smaller and my ntf bigger
[12:12] <psYchotic> good evening, I dist-upgraded yesterday, and I was wondering how I could blacklist modules now that the /etc/hotplug/blacklist isn't working anymore
[12:12] <HymnToLife> sammy> obviously it doens't resize properly, I think you just f***ed your system up
[12:12] <sarah> Sarah is the computer name.not mine. this is 512mg ram. 900mghz machine. ide and scsi drives.
[12:12] <Warbo> sammy: You know that you need to shrink your filesystem, shrink your partition, then maybe expand your filesystem to fill the remainder of the partition? (partition and filesystem are different, and resizing partitions and not filesystems is a bad idea)
[12:12] <sammy> HymnToLife, you mean Paragon screwed my system?
[12:13] <ompaul> astrisk, I think your issues are confused, please answer this exact question, have you got a graphical user interface, full of nice point and click windows?
[12:13] <Warbo> sarah: 900 million GHz? wow!
[12:13] <HymnToLife> sammy> yep
[12:13] <sammy> Warbo, sorry i don't understand im not so good in eglish
[12:13] <HymnToLife> as I told you, ext partitions should not be resied at all
[12:13] <HymnToLife> they're not designed for this
[12:13] <C|int> hey all
[12:13] <sammy> shit...
[12:13] <C|int> comging back to ubuntu
[12:13] <C|int> :)
[12:14] <acke> Hey, im on a laptop. the mouse pad moves my mouse to fast.... I have tried to change the mouse speed in the mouse setting in preferences. but the speed is unaffeced. How can i change the mouse pad speed of the mouse????
[12:14] <soundray> psYchotic: I *believe* it's just a matter of creating a file containing the name of the to-be-blacklisted module in /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/
[12:14] <Warbo> sammy: Files are stored on filesystems (like ext3) and those are kept in partitions. You must resize both (the filesystem first)
[12:14] <ompaul> sammy, get yourself a live CD and see if you can rescue anything, but somehow I doubt you will be able to
[12:14] <sarah> mghz is mega hertz
[12:14] <C|int> I am not going mess with FreeBSD, even latest, I mean if I have to load commands, snd_ich to load, my intel sound. lol.. bs on that :P
[12:14] <psYchotic> soundray: thanks, I'll try that
[12:14] <HymnToLife> sarah> nop, MHz is :)
[12:14] <C|int> hey Warbo
[12:14] <C|int> I"m back :)
[12:14] <phreak97> sarah, no it isnt
[12:14] <Warbo> C|int: Hey
[12:14] <phreak97> MHz is
[12:14] <C|int> I mean, after all, I got Cedega 5.0 working great, and I shouldn't of said what I said about ubuntu
[12:15] <pez> hi, i was wondering if there is anyone that could answer my question regarding partiotining?
[12:15] <sammy> ompaul, i have a livecd but i have no possiblity to backup my data
[12:15] <HymnToLife> phreak97> u g0t pwn3d :)
[12:15] <phreak97> C|int beat me to it
[12:15] <C|int> heya pez :)
[12:15] <C|int> beta ya to what?
[12:15] <C|int> :P
[12:15] <phreak97> to correcting sarah
[12:15] <pez> hi C|Int.. how are you dude? :-)
[12:16] <blaze> hey, may somebody help me resize my partitions in ubuntu?
[12:16] <jonatan> sammy, do you have any backups of yoru data ?
[12:16] <phreak97> wow, this is the first time i've seen anything other than a help desk in here
[12:16] <blaze> and tell me how to format them
[12:16] <jonatan> sammy, especially, did you put /home on a separate partition ?
[12:16] <Warbo> Anyone in here now that knows what filesystem Ubuntu's default inird images are?
[12:16] <astrisk> ompaul, yes i have a graphical user interface, but the problem is that while playing any video my video clearity is not upto the mark and also then motion of the video is not same as it has to be..
[12:16] <pez> my question is exactly the same as blaze's
[12:16] <sarah> ok.. 900 MHZ stands for mega hertz
[12:16] <blaze> oh cool :)
[12:16] <pez> how bizzare..
[12:16] <blaze> :D
[12:16] <phreak97> sarah, no, the z is lower case
[12:17] <blaze> strange, yes :) but a coincidence
[12:17] <ompaul> sammy, well then loose windows and you won't make that mistake again :-) seriously get your partitioning right before you try reinstalling again give yourself at least 10G for ubuntu but personally I have over 200 G in this box all ubuntu and its not the only ubuntu machine here :-) (no other o/s allowed ;-))
[12:17] <sammy> jonatan, yes on cds but it will take to much time i did this alla after deleting gentoo ...
[12:17] <phreak97> 900 MHz
[12:17] <soundray> blaze, pez: boot from a live CD and run gparted
[12:17] <jonatan> blaze: do you have an existing ubuntu install or are you trying to partition another disk before installing ubuntu ?
[12:17] <blaze> oh, ok :)
[12:17] <Warbo> astrisk: Try reducing the colour depth to 16, that may make it run faster
[12:17] <blaze> i have an existing ubuntu install
[12:17] <tristanmike> what command do i use to see the size of my swap partition ?
[12:17] <blaze> i've just deleted my windows :)
[12:17] <ompaul> !tell astrisk about restrictedformats
[12:17] <tristanmike> please and thanx
[12:17] <jonatan> blaze: in that case I STRONGLY recomend backing up your data first
[12:17] <pez> does the LFS Live CD contain gparted?
[12:17] <joeblu> tristanmike, i would run gparted
[12:18] <blaze> oh, don't worry :D it's ok ;)
[12:18] <ompaul> astrisk, you might get some use out of that page that ubotu pointed you to.
[12:18] <soundray> tristanmike: cat /proc/meminfo
[12:18] <ompaul> !tell astrisk about resolution
[12:18] <sammy> ompaul, i need windows but i need it for somethings and i nedet more space on my windows partition so i changed the size
[12:18] <phreak97> sarah ?
[12:18] <jonatan> blaze, no, really, resizing partitions is one of those things that can potentially make it a pain trying to retreive all your files
[12:18] <tristanmike> thanx soundray :)
[12:18] <blaze> ok
[12:18] <soundray> tristanmike: sudo fdisk -l should also show it
[12:19] <pez> what linux distrubution does everyone here use?
[12:19] <ompaul> sammy, well you need to give ubuntu a reasonable amount of room if your to use it and enjoy it and as I said about 10G is the minimum that I would suggest to anyone for a general purpose machine
[12:19] <blaze> so.. i have to boot from the live cd and run gparted, right?
[12:19] <tristanmike> soundray, fdisk, that's what I was looking for, I was thinking df -h, but that didn
[12:19] <cubikdice> pez, Ubuntu
[12:19] <tristanmike> *t do it for me
[12:19] <jonatan> pez, channel name...
[12:19] <soundray> pez: don't you read the /topic?
[12:19] <phreak97> pez, i use a broken ubuntu
[12:19] <tristanmike> soundray, thanx again
[12:19] <sammy> ompaul, my partiton for ubuntu is 90gig
[12:19] <sarah> Many Linux installations require a lot less space on the hard drive than any windows. Unless it is Win3.1
[12:19] <ompaul> sammy, :-) kewl
[12:19] <jonatan> blaze, do you want to increase or decrease the partition size ?
[12:20] <blaze> well.. maby increase
[12:20] <liquidindian> Does anyone know what to do with a .run file for installation?
[12:20] <C|int> sorry ubuntu for giving up so early, I just am not going go through a configuration for wireless, then next thing you know, the dam thing looses its modules,
[12:20] <ompaul> sammy, but it looks like a reinstall is your only option
[12:20] <sammy> ompaul, linux is my main system windows just for music production and some games
[12:20] <C|int> back
[12:20] <blaze> not maby, but increase
[12:20] <joe__> soundray: It didn't work.  The device I have windows on is /dev/hdb5, how do I tell it to boot from there?
[12:20] <ompaul> sammy, agnula for music :)
[12:20] <phreak97> sarah, MHz (capitol capitol lowercase
[12:20] <phreak97> )
[12:20] <aphorism> sammy you should support the linux music production scene
[12:20] <jonatan> blaze: I'd suggest you use the install CD to simply create a new partition
[12:20] <blaze> i have 1 vfat empty partition
[12:20] <ompaul> sammy, by the time eft comes out it may have more music features
[12:20] <blaze> and i can format it from ubuntu
[12:20] <C|int> hey sammy, I have made some games, just a theory, compared to running Cedega 5.0
[12:21] <pez> sorry im a complete linux noob
[12:21] <blaze> and make it extended 3
[12:21] <sammy> ompaul, there must be a posiblity to fix this reinstall system is just the windows way i think an on linux you fix it ^^
[12:21] <blaze> but i want the swap partition to be increased too
[12:21] <blaze> so.. what should i do :)
[12:21] <jonatan> blaze: I'd just create new partitions in the empety space.
[12:21] <sammy> C|int, yes but i don't have a high peformance an cedega is to slow for me ^^
[12:21] <C|int> and today, I'm gettin ready to setup VMware Player, and win4lin, and then run a fluxbox , and then via , Windows inside linux. . pretty much the most secure you can get it without having to have a IDS< intrusion detection system
[12:21] <jonatan> blaze: its quite possible to have more than one swap partition
[12:21] <blaze> but.. how can i create a new partition with a definite size?
[12:21] <woodwizzle> Is Dapper still coming out the 1st?
[12:22] <Flannel> woodwizzle: yep
[12:22] <ompaul> sammy, you don't know what you broke, try the liveCD and see what you can find
[12:22] <blaze> so that i can create a linux partition and leave space for another swap partition
[12:22] <blaze> ?
[12:22] <jonatan> blaze: you delete the vfat partition and then use the partitioner to create new ones
[12:22] <woodwizzle> awesome
[12:22] <woodwizzle> =)
[12:22] <blaze> and.. the partitioner is gparted?
[12:22] <ompaul> woodwizzle, yes
[12:22] <Flannel> blaze: on the liveCD, yes
[12:22] <sammy> ompaul, so you mean i have to backup the data an reinstall kubuntu?
[12:22] <jonatan> blaze: the partitioner will quite happily let you specify the partition size
[12:23] <blaze> and.. can i use another linux's live cd?
[12:23] <tHeDvL> i did, apt-get install tftpd-hpa
[12:23] <tHeDvL> it installed
[12:23] <tHeDvL> how can i run it now ?
[12:23] <blaze> i have knoppix V4.0
[12:23] <blaze> liveCD
[12:23] <jonatan> blaze: the by far easiest way is to use the ubuntu install CD and select manual partitioning. Then just abort the installation when you are done
[12:23] <tHeDvL> please help me :(
[12:23] <tHeDvL> running tftp server
[12:23] <blaze> ok, cool :), thanks jonatan :)
[12:23] <inicehyena> anyone know what the system requirements for Xubuntu are? roughly?
[12:24] <blaze> i'll try
[12:24] <cmatheson> are there any repositories that have sox w/ mp3-support built in? (or, does anyone know a good way to convert oggs to mp3s)?
[12:24] <Flannel> tHeDvL: it's most likely already running
[12:24] <Vixus> sarah: I never said I liked win2k
[12:24] <blaze> brb ;)
[12:24] <jonatan> blaze: do create backups first
[12:24] <blaze> i know, ok :)
[12:24] <Vixus> sarah: It's the most pants thing ever
[12:24] <jonatan> blaze: really
[12:24] <tHeDvL> Flannel: how can i run it ?
[12:24] <blaze> :D
[12:24] <|neo> does any one has de repositories to get the mplayer for dapper ?
[12:24] <blaze> ok, i heard you
[12:24] <ndlovu> If I connect to a samba share using Places > Network Servers, can I then access that share from the commandline?
[12:24] <phreak97> is it worth upgrading to dapper?
[12:24] <Flannel> tHeDvL: it's already running most likely.
[12:24] <phreak97> what changes are there?
[12:25] <tHeDvL> Flannel: explain please
[12:25] <ompaul> tHeDvL, this is a list of the uses of tftpd on the wiki check them out and see which one matches your situation best: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=tftpd&fullsearch=Text
[12:25] <Flannel> phreak97: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperbeta
[12:25] <ompaul> phreak97, lots and the dapper channel is #ubuntu+1 for another 7 or so days
[12:26] <tHeDvL> ompaul: ok thanks
[12:26] <dou213> what's a good file browser in ubuntu?
[12:26] <ompaul> tHeDvL, enjoy

=== xPip is now known as Pip
[12:27] <dou213> other ones?
[12:27] <jonatan> phreak97: probably worth it, but you may want to wait a week or so until it goes official
[12:27] <ompaul> Nuevo, source?
[12:27] <skircr115> hello
[12:27] <mish4> any of you use conky?
[12:27] <C|int> hey,; anto9us still here?
[12:27] <jonatan> ompaul: if you use gnome nautilus, if you use kde konqueror
[12:27] <C|int> I want to get , Breezy , working wireless again, like we had did, or unless dapper would.. eh :)
[12:28] <Vixus> C|int: I'd love to as well. :)
[12:28] <ompaul> jonatan, he said Ubuntu not Kubuntu :-)
[12:28] <Vixus> Xubuntu?
[12:28] <eth0-noob> does anyone here know who i could change my xbox to be used like a computer and can help me do it? ( i want everything gone and just the computer part of xbox. )
[12:28] <Ratzilla> does anyone hereknow how to use ubuntu-calendar?
[12:28] <C|int> Vixus: , hee, I had it up, but I got so excited and did, a dist-upgrade
[12:28] <eth0-noob> how*
[12:28] <Vixus> C|int: Well, I need to get it setup on my laptop with a USB dongle
[12:28] <jonatan> ompaul: well technically I'm using KDE on ubuntu as I installed ubuntu to begin with and then switched to KDE ... but yea...
[12:28] <ndlovu> *sigh* computers would be so much better if we didn't have to wait for reboots, I/O, processing, etc...
[12:28] <skircr115> yeah
[12:29] <skircr115> no joke
[12:29] <Vixus> ndlovu: But that's what makes them computers.
[12:29] <skircr115> true
[12:29] <eth0-noob> lol
[12:29] <phreak97> jonatan, thanks, i reckon ill upgrade once it goes final
[12:29] <eth0-noob> heh bye
[12:29] <phreak97> or official
[12:29] <Vixus> like if eth0-noob turns his xbox into a computer
[12:29] <phreak97> whatever
[12:29] <Vixus> it will have to boot
[12:29] <skircr115> yeah, he eh
[12:29] <C|int> Vixus: , what type of wireless you got, lets both work on this together
[12:30] <C|int> I am not going let any network protoocol stand in my way, or any unability to do what I have my mind set up
[12:30] <Vixus> C|int: thanks, it's a Belkin USB dongle F5D7050
[12:30] <Vixus> I heard ndiswrapper can handle it
[12:30] <C|int> oh.. eh usb lol :P
[12:30] <Vixus> C|int: http://www.jroller.com/page/nobodii?entry=belkin_f5d7050_on_ubuntu
[12:30] <C|int> cool :)
[12:30] <ompaul> !ndiswrapper
[12:30] <ubotu> I guess ndiswrapper is a way to support Windows wireless drivers, but it is buggy compared to native support. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[12:30] <C|int> usb isn't that fast though
[12:30] <ompaul> Vixus, ^^^
[12:30] <jonatan> Vixus, frankly, I prefer it when computers boot. Like the other day I tried to upgrade to dapper, something went wrong and it wouldn't boot...
[12:31] <C|int> yep yep, I alreayd know about ndiswrapper lol @ u guys
[12:31] <skircr115> j
[12:31] <C|int> hey guys, lets say I want to use breezy, or what would be best for ReiserFS
[12:31] <C|int> ?
[12:31] <phreak97> bye ppl
[12:31] <Vixus> ompaul: ^^^?
[12:31] <cubikdice> bye
[12:31] <Vixus> Here I go with Xubuntu.
[12:31] <jonatan> C|int: I couldn't get ndiswrapper to work on dapper when I tried, but that was some time ago, so it might be fixed now.
[12:31] <Vixus> Hope it runs this time
[12:31] <ompaul> Vixus, look up a few lines - in that case a link to ndiswrapper in ubuntu: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[12:32] <Vixus> Oh
[12:32] <Vixus> The crucial thing is getting my usb dongle detected
[12:32] <joe__> If I have Windows XP on partition 5 (it's NTFS), how do I make an entry in /boot/grub/menu.ls to boot it?
[12:32] <C|int> yeah, I heard ya jonatan, me either
[12:33] <ompaul> Vixus, lsusb or >> sudo lshw | more << do you see it there? if not move it to another usb port
[12:33] <C|int> i almost had it on , Breezy, then I did a dist-upgrade
[12:33] <C|int> and it messed it up
[12:33] <ompaul> !tell joe__ about grub
[12:33] <sarah> Someone asked about min. req. for Ubuntu. Website says PC Intel x86. That will cover a lot of machines..
[12:34] <C|int> today though, I am going get it working, and plus, I am going install vmware player, and workstation, and win4lin , whatever the heck I have to do, and install a fluxbox, and have windows running inside linux and I going be bad ass
[12:34] <miranda82> hello
[12:34] <C|int> talk to you all in a bit
[12:34] <miranda82> is there anyway to mount an .img file?
[12:34] <ompaul> sarah, if you want a spec my lowest machine here is a PIII with 128 megs of ram an 8meg video card and 9 gig scsi disk .. xubuntu flies on it
[12:35] <jonatan> xbuntu is the xfce version of ubuntu, yea ?
[12:35] <icheyne> yes
=== lars-ut is now known as lars-ut-away
[12:36] <ompaul> miranda82, this might work but I don't know substitute the relevant parts: To mount an ISO image file, you can use "sudo mount -o loop <image-file> <mount-point>" from a shell (for example, "sudo mount -o loop Ubuntu.iso /mnt/loop", if /mnt/loop exists)
[12:36] <jonatan> meh, I like my bloated bouncy KDE windows :P
[12:36] <miranda82> ompaul, ISO
[12:36] <icheyne> anyone know how I can check exactly what memory I have on my system, without opening my case up? (I'm lazy)
[12:36] <miranda82> ompaul, u thing it should work?
[12:36] <C|int> well, I am going get that wireless working... talk in a few..
[12:36] <sarah> xubuntu is with the XFCE desktop env.
[12:37] <ompaul> miranda82, well I have no other ideas the most it can do is faile
[12:37] <lsuactiafner> icheyne : free -m
[12:37] <C|int> and I am not going let nothing stand in my way, and i will help others with wireless world wide
[12:37] <icheyne> lsuactiafner, thanks
[12:37] <icheyne> I'll try that now
[12:37] <C|int> I will ever record , in real time, with TechSmith Camtasia Studio how to do it.. ;)
[12:37] <[NP] Tangent> cool
[12:37] <Vixus> WOW
[12:37] <[NP] Tangent> I got the Hydrogen virtual drum machine working
[12:37] <C|int> with sound and everything
[12:37] <Vixus> Xubuntu on my laptop!!!
[12:37] <Vixus> :O
[12:37] <ompaul> Vixus, enjoy
[12:37] <C|int> I mean, the things I can do with windows. hee :)
[12:37] <C|int> Vixus: , don't worry :)
[12:37] <txoko> hello. Anybody is a valgrind expert?
[12:38] <sybariten> which is the most "advanced" winrar clone runnable under ubuntu (hoary) ?
[12:38] <Vixus> ugh
[12:38] <Vixus> how do I login>
[12:38] <Vixus> what is the username and password? XD
[12:38] <game16> hey?
[12:38] <icheyne> free -m is OK, but it doesn't tell me if I have sdram etc
[12:38] <Flannel> sybariten: what do you define advanced as?
[12:38] <ompaul> Vixus, the ones you used during the install
[12:38] <Vixus> ompaul: LiveCD
[12:38] <Vixus> :D
[12:38] <txoko> I would like someone to help me on running valgrind on a heavy program ... is it possible?
[12:38] <sybariten> Flannel: able to extract multipart rars
[12:38] <ompaul> Vixus, interesting try #xubuntu
[12:38] <shylock> how can i get gnome 2.14 i cant seem to find it in synaptic?
[12:38] <shylock> i have breezy
[12:39] <katie_> can someone help me installa wireless card?  sohoware nd5120-E
[12:39] <icheyne> lsuactiafner, any other suggestions?? :S
[12:39] <jonatan> shylock: if you wait a week or so until Dapper is released I think it is included by default
[12:39] <ompaul> katie_, please check the message from the channel bot
[12:39] <sarah> Well my experience with most smaller Linux versions is .. some work great with only 200MGH and 128 or less ram.
[12:40] <Flannel> sybariten: unrar not work for you for some reason?
[12:40] <katie_> ompaul:   mine might be supported though
[12:40] <sybariten> Flannel: yeah well it puked on this archive, at least
[12:40] <jonatan> sarah, but but, no bouncy cursors : /
[12:40] <shylock> jonatan, will it be a lot of trouble upgrading you think?
[12:40] <sybariten> Flannel: plus i have a vague memory of it not working too well with password protected archives
[12:40] <ompaul> katie_, then system administration networking and you should be able to take it from there
=== benplaut is now known as benplaut|edu
[12:41] <sarah> Here we have about ten diff. kinds of Linux.. including Centoo... some cd boot..
[12:41] <jcsston> is it possible to disable a module (hpt366) in the kernel without recompiling the kernel?
[12:41] <sarah> what does a bouncy curser mean..?
[12:41] <jonatan> shylock, it shoudl be relatively straight forward, but thats one of the reasons why you wan't to keep your home directory on a separate partition. It makes it very easy to just do a fresh install of the system without losing data
[12:42] <txoko> I would like someone to help me on running valgrind on a heavy program ... is it possible?
[12:42] <sarah> cursor
[12:42] <crimsun> txoko: yes, but it will be /very/ sluggish
[12:42] <Pyru> Hello, I am curious on how to update firefox to the newest version
[12:42] <Pyru> I am new to linux
[12:42] <shylock> jonatan, how about all software i struggled to installm will it be removed too?
[12:42] <philipsmith> I've just installed a nice ripper: goobox. I want to add it to the "sound and video" list under the "applications" menu. How do I do this?
[12:43] <txoko> crimsun: is there a possibilitie to apply valgrind only to some parts of the code of a program???
[12:43] <jonatan> sarah, the busy cursors in KDE sort of bounce. Some people find KDE bloated, hence it was a little joke
[12:43] <sarah> Look.. Linux does not run like Window 2k or even win95/98 Seems Linux does not hog mem like win appl.
[12:43] <shylock> jonatan, would really suck to start over again when i spent 2 weeks getting everything tor run
[12:43] <Pyru> Hello, I am curious on how to update firefox to the newest version
[12:43] <joe__> How do I boot from an NTFS partition with grub?  When I try to set its root to the partition, it says the filesystem is unknown, and when I try to make it active it tells me the device is invalid.

[12:44] <philipsmith> Pyru: Why?
[12:44] <kung> gn8
[12:45] <shylock> jonatan,  btw are you Jonathan Ridell?
[12:46] <jonatan> shylock: uhm , no
[12:46] <jonatan> shylock: hence the spelling of my name

[12:50] <crimsun> txoko: if integrated with the debugger interactively, perhaps. That's a question for the man page.
[12:50] <jonatan> [Surge] : can you mount it?
[12:50] <ompaul> [Surge] , please read the message from ubotu that should sort you out
[12:50] <ndlovu> okay, using the live cd, is there any way I can get commandline access to a samba share? nautilus can connect, but then I can't do anything from a terminal :(
[12:51] <sarah> Pyru: Download latest from mozilla.org The ver. for your particular Linux may not be avail...
[12:51] <ompaul> ndlovu, don't try to write to it I will have  the bot tell you about mounting it
[12:52] <ompaul> ndlovu, you are looking at the samba client
[12:52] <Pyru> sarah, I got it thanks!
[12:53] <txoko> crimsun: thanks a lot!!!
[12:53] <ndlovu> ompaul: my understanding is that that's not included in the livecd? sudo mount -t smbfs //server/share /mnt/share doesn't work for me...
[12:53] <Pyru> few more questions, I installed wine and installed steam, so i can play counterstrike, but its not working :S
[12:53] <Manika> can we expect dapper on june 1st?
[12:54] <sarah> Pyru A hint which we have learned .. make a data disk/part. for all important data.. save you a ton of time if system crashes..
[12:54] <jojoman02> i've been praying for it, lets see if it works out
[12:54] <andrejkw> Transfers between my Bluetooth phone and PC always freeze at a certain point.
[12:54] <ompaul> ndlovu, well you can install things on the livecd if you have the ram to support it, and  you can make things persistant
[12:54] <gordonjcp> tremulous > counterstrike
[12:54] <andrejkw> I can't figure out whats wrong :(
[12:54] <andrejkw> Sometimes it freezes later and soemtimes right in the beginning.
[12:54] <[Surge] > jonatan: No I can't.
[12:54] <ndlovu> ompaul: would that be using apt-get install?
[12:55] <ndlovu> ompaul: ah...
[12:55] <[Surge] > ubotu: ?
[12:55] <ubotu> Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, [Surge] 
[12:55] <ompaul> ndlovu, or synaptic you can do it anyway you like, more important to make it persist I sent you a how to keep that data

[12:55] <ubotu> Yep, that's me! I'm a bot alright. Read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbotuUsage to find out how to use me. Do NOT play with me in any channel except #debian-bots.
[12:55] <jonatan> [Surge] : ubotu is a BOT
[12:55] <sola6662> yo whats the .deb so i can get wine?
[12:56] <[Surge] > Yeah I know - just haven't used it before.
[12:56] <sarah> Pyru In the old days we used floppies to boot and save to another, and if floppy was destryed, thanked ourseves for backups.. we should think like that today
[12:56] <ompaul> sola6662, system add applicaitons

[01:00] <[Surge] > Yes I know :)
[01:00] <disinterested_pe> so is there more stuff for dapper than breezy?

[01:08] <Flannel> disinterested_pe: use alien.  There's a howto on the wiki, Im sure.
[01:08] <ompaul> [Surge] , have you moved it to another port in the last 10 minutes?
[01:08] <disinterested_pe> hummm got the page
[01:09] <tubbie> ic56, nope, the title bar
[01:09] <jonatan> [Surge] : I really have no clue.
[01:09] <tubbie> the bar on the top of the window
[01:09] <[Surge] > ompaul: Nope - I was just copying and pasting other people's troubles. However I never found a solution to their posts.
[01:09] <[Surge] > That pastebin one is from my dmesg.
[01:10] <sarah> pyru: http://opensource.sys-con.com/read/219877.htm  tells of use of Wine in Linux
[01:10] <disinterested_pe> if i can ever figure out this linux i wont have to buy xp discs again
[01:11] <ompaul> [Surge] , give us the output of >> sudo fdisk -l << in the pastebin
[01:11] <jonatan> disinterested_pe: most things shoudl be straight forward to install through the package manager
[01:11] <jojoman02> disinterested_pe, regardless of the yahoo thing, i would still use Dapper Drake...
[01:11] <andrejkw> wow
[01:11] <ic56> tubbie: I don't think you grow a window's titlebar.  I assume you wanted to add a second line to it, so the window's title wouldn't be truncated?
[01:11] <andrejkw> i think i solved it my plugging it into a diff USB
[01:11] <jonatan> disinterested_pe: usually its a good idea to see if it is in the repositories before trying to download it manually
[01:11] <disinterested_pe> ive got dapper ordered lol
[01:12] <disinterested_pe> when they start shipping
[01:12] <jojoman02> disinterested_pe, you can always try using alien with an rpm
[01:12] <disinterested_pe> ok jonatan
[01:12] <disinterested_pe> i'll look
[01:12] <[Surge] > http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14563
[01:12] <jonatan> disinterested_pe: try to search for it using synaptic ( or whatever you use )
[01:13] <disinterested_pe> i dont know how jojo
[01:13] <jonatan> if it pops up there it should be pretty much just work
[01:13] <facugaich> Where can I put some commands to be run at boot time?
[01:14] <sarah> disinterested_pe: running Linux is like any other system. The rub is learning the system. that can take time. I am 66, and I am still learning more than one kind of Linux, not just Ubuntu. There are many others out ther Suse has great support as does Ubuntu.. I like Ubuntu, automatic updates.. that is cool, not many have it.
[01:14] <ompaul> [Surge] , :-( I was hoping against hope that it had two partitions, one hidden and that was what was causing the problem
[01:14] <sola6662> yo sarah may i ask u something?
[01:14] <Rug> in /etc/network/interfaces should the line read:    gatewaydev=ppp0     _or_    gatewaydev ppp0            ?????
[01:15] <[Surge] > Where do the USB gurus hang out?
[01:15] <ompaul> [Surge] , got a live CD  of dapper or warty around?
[01:15] <sarah> disinterested_pe: On top of all that.. Ubuntu is absolutely free, thanks to a millionare, as stated on the website.
[01:15] <[Surge] > ompaul: Unfortunately not.
[01:16] <disinterested_pe> yeah im not saying anything bad about it sarah
[01:16] <ompaul> [Surge] , thats a bug stick it into lauchpad using the dmesg and fdisk -l  commands to give weight to it
[01:16] <sola6662> i have a storage drive that i cant get into its NTFS formated HDD is there a way i can get to my files without formating?
[01:16] <ompaul> [Surge] , launchpad.net
[01:16] <Flannel> !tell sola6662 about ntfs
[01:16] <sarah> sola6662: sure go for it.. I have a little more time..
[01:16] <ompaul> [Surge] , I assume you have dsl?
[01:16] <[Surge] > Dialup :D
[01:16] <gleesond> whats the link for pasting code???
[01:17] <rdk> hi, I have installed ubuntu on my desktop system for the first time... On first boot it gives an error that HAL cannot initialize.  I have tried reinstalling from synaptic, but that didn't work.  I am using 5.10.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what to try next?
[01:17] <ompaul> surge its freedom toaster time then
[01:17] <Rug> !pastebin
[01:17] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[01:17] <Rug> gleesond: or pastebin.com
[01:17] <[Surge] > ompaul: Ok but I'll try bug some USB guys first. Thanks,
[01:18] <ompaul> [Surge] , in general they will insist on you putting it in launchpad first
[01:18] <jonatan> facugaich: there are a bunch of directories named rc0.d , rc1.d etc in /etc/ sticking stuff there causes them to run at the corresponding runlevel
[01:18] <[Surge] > ompaul: What is launchpad?
=== lvraab is now known as CerealBowl
[01:18] <ic56> facugaich: what command did you want to run?
[01:18] <ompaul> [Surge] , launchpad.net a simple web interface for bug reporting
[01:18] <[Surge] > Ah ok
[01:18] <[Surge] > Thanks
[01:18] <jojoman02> [Surge] , and it's also for traslations
[01:19] <disinterested_pe> i guess there is no plugins for rpm in  synaptic
[01:19] <disinterested_pe> firefox rpm
[01:19] <rdk> anyone have any idea on what to do about HAL not initializing on first boot?
[01:19] <disinterested_pe> mplayer plug-ins
[01:20] <ompaul> !rpm
[01:20] <ubotu> rpm is, like, totally, the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
[01:21] <ompaul> !alien
[01:21] <ubotu> from memory, alien is a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[01:21] <jonatan> disinterested_pe: it might be in the restriced or multiverse respoistories
[01:21] <ompaul> disinterested_pe, ^^^ look back a couple of lines
[01:21] <disinterested_pe> ok
[01:21] <disinterested_pe> ty i will trash them
[01:21] <sarah> sola6662: Well, what OS
[01:22] <ompaul> disinterested_pe, rpms are bad  for Ubuntu in general you can get it all in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[01:22] <rdk> no one has any ideas on what to do when HAL wont' start on a clean install?  this would seem like a not-so-good bug to me..
[01:22] <dou213> hey does somebody here have xgl properly installed and can support me? i've already tried #ubuntu-xgl but nobody's answering
[01:22] <disinterested_pe> what about alien lol
[01:22] <amphi> dou213: #ubuntu+1 perhaps
[01:23] <dou213> ok
[01:23] <ompaul> disinterested_pe, it will more than likely cause you pain there are lots of things you can do without going near that space
[01:23] <disinterested_pe> ok om
[01:23] <disinterested_pe> ive trashed the files anyhow
[01:24] <disinterested_pe> i was just trying to get more streamlink stations to work
[01:25] <disinterested_pe> out of all the ones i had on windows only one will work on this
[01:25] <sarah> sola6662: Here is a link..  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=77367
[01:25] <abec> hi all
[01:26] <ompaul> !ntfs
[01:26] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[01:26] <mish4> "mounting local filesystem failed" when i boot ubuntu
[01:26] <mish4> any ideas?
[01:26] <disinterested_pe> can someone with breezy also go to a link and see if the stream will work
[01:26] <ompaul> sola6662, ^^ back up a couple of lines
[01:26] <nry> hi ppl
[01:26] <nry> good nite
[01:27] <kar-tar> I'm having trouble setting up a new monitor.  It's a BenQ 202W, and it should be running at 1680x1050.
[01:27] <ompaul> !resolution
[01:27] <ubotu> somebody said resolution was at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[01:27] <ompaul> kar-tar, ^^
[01:27] <shadowman> yeah
[01:27] <kar-tar> mmmk
[01:27] <shadowman> u must re-config xorg
[01:27] <nry> I want to install a tar.bz2 program, any help
[01:28] <jonatan> mish4: I get that as well and I got it down to my USB flash disk, apparently it was plugged in when I installed the system and it attempts to mount it even if it isn't there.
[01:28] <mish4> anyway to figure out whats cauising the error?
[01:28] <shadowman> yeah tar xvjf program.tar.bz2
[01:29] <shadowman> =] 
[01:29] <disinterested_pe> well im going to take my green iguana out side for a walk
[01:30] <nry> shadowman, thanx
[01:30] <shadowman> n/p
[01:30] <sarah> Most unix/ Linux systems uses formatting similar to FAT32, am I correct? Like MS Dos.
=== msyg|sleepy is now known as waky|off
[01:30] <ompaul> sarah, no
[01:30] <abec> can someone help me, i have connection problem with xp on vmware
[01:30] <ndlovu> okay, I figure that dvdrecord is just the tool I need to write a DVD-R. Except it seems to need an iso as input. no problem, I write an iso. Except that the filesystem won't let it get over 2GB. so how can I write an iso?
[01:30] <shadowman> sarah: nope linuxes uses ext3 filesystem
[01:31] <shadowman> fat32 is a win32 fs
[01:31] <amphi> shadowman: amongst others
[01:31] <ompaul> sarah, totally different style of system, most people use a journalled fs called EXT3 then there are several others
[01:31] <shadowman> yeah there's few fs's
[01:31] <Rug> in /etc/network/interfaces should the line read:    gatewaydev=ppp0     _or_    gatewaydev ppp0            ?????
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> hey guys
[01:32] <shadowman> yo
[01:32] <shadowman> :D
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> I'm having a problem with Audacity
[01:32] <sarah> Of course, but it is certainally not like Win FTFS
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> wait
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> wtf
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> it all of a sudden works
[01:32] <[NP] Tangent> odd
[01:32] <amphi> Rug: you shouldn't need anything in interfaces for ppp0, the pppd up scripts should set the default gw
[01:33] <shadowman> lol
[01:33] <Rug> amphi: this is on a firewall (FYI)
[01:33] <shadowman> damn i ate too much :/
[01:33] <amphi> Rug: when ppp0 comes up, the default route should be set automagically
[01:34] <kar-tar> annoying.  dpkg reconfigure crashes, but ddcprobe gets all the specs right
[01:34] <jvai> hey uall
[01:34] <shadowman> yo jvai
[01:34] <Rug> ack
[01:34] <jvai> dapZ SHADOW
[01:34] <shadowman> dapZ?
[01:34] <Rug> amphi: that wasn't the answer I was hoping for.  =)
[01:34] <shadowman> lol
[01:35] <shadowman> i didnt get it :P
[01:35] <amphi> Rug: heh - I'm not aware of a 'gatewaydev' option in interfaces in any case
[01:35] <nry> shadowman, man, I get that....checking for C++ compiler default output file name... configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
[01:35] <Rug> amphi: it does make a difference.
[01:35] <shadowman> u must install c++ package for gcc
[01:35] <Rug> because if I set it wrong, then things go weird
[01:36] <facugaich> are jonatan or ic56 still here?
[01:36] <ic56> facugaich: yes
[01:36] <shadowman> damn i dont remeber what this package is called
[01:36] <shadowman> hmmmm...
[01:36] <facugaich> ic56, I want to load a modules, run a command related to it and finnaly an "ifconfig"
[01:37] <shadowman> lol ifconfig works in ubuntu?
[01:37] <amphi> Rug: here, the pppd defaultroute option is in /etc/peers/$PROVIDER
[01:37] <amphi> Rug: er, /etc/ppp/peers/$PROVIDER
[01:37] <Rug> is that setup by using pppoeconf ?
[01:37] <sarah> Getting NTFS files to Linux, if important could be transferred from a Win. machine to cd then to Linux. Safest way. Mounting a drive like that, If important data, is not a good idea..
[01:37] <ic56> facugaich: ok. how much do you know about runlevels and the /etc/init.d directory?
[01:37] <ndlovu> is there some way to use cdrecord without creating an image first?
[01:38] <shadowman> sarah: yeah NTFS dont working propelry on linux
[01:38] <amphi> Rug: oh, pppoe? that may be different; this was setup by pppconfig
[01:38] <Rug> are you on cable or DSL?
[01:38] <facugaich> ic56, I read some man page about a script to add others scripts to rc*.d, don't remember its name though
[01:39] <shadowman> u can just read, and if u want to write u can loose all ur data
[01:39] <shadowman> it sux thought
[01:39] <facugaich> ic56, so, not much
[01:39] <sarah> Yes, I have transferred many files including picture files with cd transfer, never will affect that drive.
[01:39] <amphi> Rug: both dialup and dsl peers files use the same pppd defaultroute option
[01:39] <shadowman> :)
[01:40] <ic56> facugaich: interesting. I didn't know there was such a tool.  I should look into it.  Anyway, hang on a couple minutes.  I have a somewhat canned response to your Q.
[01:40] <amphi> Rug: the only time I used a cable modem, I just plugged in the the ethernet and ran dhclient
[01:40] <facugaich> ic56, thank you, I'll wait
[01:40] <shadowman> amphi: yeah this is the easiest way
[01:40] <leojstewart> is there any way to play Windows Media DRM files in ubuntu?
[01:40] <shadowman> DRM?
[01:41] <shadowman> wtf is that?
[01:41] <Rug> amphi: Did anybody ever tell you; that you are an awesome source of ulcers?
[01:41] <amphi> Rug: heh
[01:41] <leojstewart> shadowman: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_DRM
[01:41] <shadowman> k
[01:41] <Rug> ack this is annoying...
[01:41] <Rug> thanks for your help
[01:41] <facugaich> Digital Rights Management?
[01:42] <sarah> Remember experience is usually by doing, have a nice one, hope to return some time.. Well back to my Windows 2000 system.. :)
[01:42] <shadowman> win32 codecs for mplayer does not include this 1?
[01:42] <leojstewart> I need to be able to play files that use DRM
[01:42] <leojstewart> no, it doesn't.
[01:42] <shadowman> hmm
[01:42] <amphi> leojstewart: 'need'?? ;)
[01:42] <leojstewart> and the ubuntu wiki says that it is unable to play them.
[01:42] <leojstewart> amphi: well, no. :P
[01:42] <shadowman> so ur problem is solved ;-)
[01:43] <amphi> leojstewart: IMHO you 'need' to boycott such filth ;)
[01:43] <leojstewart> amphi: some sites don't have an alternative
[01:43] <leojstewart> like mediazone
[01:43] <amphi> leojstewart: so don't visit them
[01:43] <ic56> facugaich: Do you know how to edit files on Linux?  With gedit or vi or something like that
[01:43] <shadowman> try win4lin and run win32 and fuck all :] 
[01:43] <facugaich> ic56, yeah
[01:43] <amphi> leojstewart: and/or complain to them that you are unable to view their broken media files ;)
[01:43] <leojstewart> amphi: but then I would have to go without my beloved Rugby
[01:44] <leojstewart> amphi: well, luckily they DO say that they know the problem exists
[01:44] <amphi> leojstewart: video files of sport are DRM'd? wtf?
[01:44] <leojstewart> amphi: and they are looking for a way to support alternative OS's
[01:44] <amphi> leojstewart: that's good news
[01:44] <leojstewart> amphi: I don't know why, either.. ><
[01:44] <shadowman> so u must w8
[01:44] <shadowman> lol
[01:45] <leojstewart> shadowman: waiting is for the weak.
[01:45] <Drac[Server] > This is a question I thought I knew the answer to after using Linux for over two years... Does Linux, for any reason, slow down as the harddrive is filled, or does having a separate file for swap and superior filesystems prevent this?
[01:45] <ndlovu> how do I check the bus address of my dvd writer? (dev = 0,1,0 or whatever)
[01:45] <amphi> leojstewart: sounds like they're trying
[01:45] <Rug> pppconfig is just for dialup (Chap and Pap) not DSl's PPPoE
[01:45] <elixter> hi, i'm going to install ubuntu on my PC and need to know does it recognise NTFS filesystem ?
[01:45] <amphi> Rug: yes
[01:45] <nry> shadowman, man, I get the same answer
[01:45] <shadowman> what progs are u compilating?
[01:46] <leojstewart> amphi: yes, but this is their advice: Please check back periodically and make your wishes known with Apple and Microsoft. 							
[01:46] <Rug> amphi: ahh good.
[01:46] <Flannel> elixter: you can read from NTFS, yes.
[01:46] <elixter> but not write ?
[01:46] <nry> shadowman, aMule
[01:46] <leojstewart> amphi: they also mention linux, just not in that sentence.
[01:46] <Flannel> elixter: nope.  NTFS is not an open standard.  Our reverse engineering efforts aren't stable all the time for writing.
[01:46] <amphi> leojstewart: buck passing, sounds like
[01:46] <shadowman> hmm
[01:46] <leojstewart> there must be some type of hack which allows me to watch it ><
[01:46] <ic56> facugaich: ok, the existing scripts that deal with networking in my Ubuntu 5.10 box are /etc/rc0.d/S35networking and /etc/rc0.d/S36ifupdown
[01:46] <nry> shadowman, idem
[01:46] <dooglus> elixter: you can't install linux onto an NTFS partition, no.  but the ubuntu installer will shrink your existing ntfs partition to make space for a linux partition if you want it to
[01:47] <shadowman> u installed the c++ package for gcc rite?
[01:47] <Tuzlo> anyone install drupal?
[01:47] <nry> shadowman, idem
[01:47] <nry> shadowman, idem
[01:47] <ic56> facugaich: you can either modify one of them or write your own.  Writing your own is more work but results in a more modular solution that might play nicer with anything else you install.
[01:47] <shadowman> nry: huh?
[01:47] <dooglus> elixter: it will recognise that you have an NTFS filesystem, but it won't be able to use it for storage.
[01:47] <ic56> facugaich: which choice do you prefer?
[01:48] <leojstewart> amphi: they also say this: (MediaZone currently supports only Windows Media Player, but other media formats will be supported soon).
[01:48] <amphi> leojstewart: I doubt MS is forcing them to use drm
[01:48] <nry> shadowman, the package is on
[01:48] <leojstewart> here's hoping....
[01:48] <facugaich> ic56, I'll have a look into those files you said
[01:48] <leojstewart> amphi: yeah, why would they use drm? are there any advantages?
[01:48] <amphi> leojstewart: suggest they use xvid, which is an open standard and supported by OSS ;)
[01:48] <shadowman> impossible to get the same error with installed package
[01:48] <elixter> ok, thanks comrades. as i understand, linux is much better than windows
[01:48] <shadowman> OR
[01:49] <ic56> facugaich: ok.  I'll be here for another 20 minutes, possibly much more.
[01:49] <amphi> leojstewart: are you sure it's drm rather than just a proprietary codec?
[01:49] <shadowman> u installed a package not for ur ver of gcc
[01:49] <facugaich> ic56: Let me see if I get this straight. All the script in rcN.d are run at the 'start' of runlevel N?
[01:49] <leojstewart> amphi: pretty sure. look: Regrettably at this time, you cannot watch MediaZone's live events or other entertainment using the Macintosh or Linux operating systems due to Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) lack of support for these operating systems.
[01:49] <nry> shadowman, I going to change my ver
[01:49] <amphi> leojstewart: of course neither MS nor apple media players will play xvid outta the box ;)
[01:50] <ndlovu> if dmesg picks up my dvd drive as hdc, would its (scsi?) address be 0,1,0?
[01:50] <leojstewart> amphi: luckily, I found a torrent site providing every rugby game
[01:50] <leojstewart> amphi: it's just not live
[01:50] <amphi> leojstewart: ask them not to use drm at all ;)
[01:50] <amphi> leojstewart: that's something
[01:51] <leojstewart> amphi: i still don't understand why they would want to use DRM in the first place
[01:51] <shadowman> u r watching rugby?
[01:51] <amphi> leojstewart: ask them, perhaps
[01:51] <shadowman> i thought u r watching football ;] 
[01:51] <leojstewart> shadowman: yes. :D
[01:51] <leojstewart> shadowman: naw, man. Rugby's where it's at. :)
[01:51] <elixter> witch filesystem is better EXT2 or EXT3 ?
[01:51] <leojstewart> amphi: yeah.  I might try.  Thanks for the help.
[01:51] <jvai> shyt.. "house" comes on tonyte, aftr amer idol, & i'm fukkin off ina coffeshop
[01:52] <leojstewart> amphi: but I guess I can put up with the non-live versions for now.
[01:52] <hollywoodb> ndlovu: try 'cdrecord -scanbus' and/or 'cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus'
[01:52] <amphi> leojstewart: it might be worth pestering them, they might cooperate
[01:52] <leojstewart> amphi: especially when they encode in Xvid and H264 and X264 most of the time... pretty nice :)
[01:52] <hyphenated> elixter: they're essentially the same. ext3 has a 'journal' on top of an ext2 filesystem
[01:52] <jonatan> elixter: define "better"
[01:53] <leojstewart> amphi: you're right.  I will try.
[01:53] <amphi> leojstewart: oh, they do? cool, so they know about them at least ;)
[01:53] <cubikdice> is it better than soccer?
[01:53] <leojstewart> cubikdice: do you want to?
[01:53] <cubikdice> sure
[01:53] <cubikdice> have always been interested
[01:53] <hollywoodb> eliphas_: ext2 data recovery tools don't work on ext3, if you accidentally delete a bunch of important stuff on ext3, its gone
[01:53] <hyphenated> leojstewart: one of the funniest things I ever saw was a couple of american football teams trying to play rugby :-)
[01:53] <shadowman> NFL rox
[01:53] <leojstewart> cubikdice: i think it's better than soccer. am I allowed to post a torrent site here?
[01:53] <kikoala> This may seem like a stupid question, but I'm sort of in a twist with it. I've got an old laptop with an AMD Duron processor. Which kernel image am I supposed to use? The AMD64 or the i386?
[01:53] <shadowman> :D
[01:53] <dustin> Hello , I am curious on how to make a luancher for a wine application on my desktop could someone help me?
[01:53] <cubikdice> leojstewart, just /query me
[01:53] <leojstewart> hyphenated: bloddy Gridiron ;)
[01:53] <amphi> leojstewart: is mediazone just spr0t ?
[01:53] <hollywoodb> kikoala: you could use k7 or 686
[01:54] <hyphenated> leojstewart: leave that stuff in private messages or #ubuntu-offtopic ;-)
[01:54] <cubikdice> kikoala, i386 seeing as it's not 64 bit
[01:54] <leojstewart> amphi: I think so... the only thing I'm interested in is their Rugby, though.
[01:54] <hollywoodb> kikoala: check the description on k7, 686 might be better
[01:54] <saif> hello, i want to buy an external hard drive, 300+GB, does ubuntu support firewire?? or should i stick to usb??
[01:54] <kikoala> OK. Thank you. I'll check up on the 686 architecture.
[01:55] <amphi> leojstewart: getting such places to 'see the light' is much better than mere boycotting, IMHO
[01:55] <dustin> Hello , I am curious on how to make a luancher for a wine application on my desktop could someone help me?
[01:55] <shadowman> saif: i think it support firewire
[01:55] <Drac[Server] > Why is such an important question ignored?
[01:55] <dooglus> mediazone proudly proclaim their system requirements as "Windows OS (No Macs)"
[01:55] <elixter> "better": one from meny thing that has more good quolities than other. Ofcourse it depends who you ask...
[01:55] <shadowman> coz we dont know that :P
[01:55] <facugaich> ic56, those files are too much for me :P
[01:55] <saif> shadowman, u know where i can check to be sure?! what should i look for??
[01:55] <ndlovu> hollywoodb: thanks. says it can't open scsi driver. that can't be good.
[01:56] <saif> how will i know if windows detected my firewire port?
[01:56] <shadowman> saif: w8
[01:56] <amphi> dooglus: leojstewart said above they often use open codecs
[01:56] <ic56> facugaich: sorry the phone rang. All the /etc/rcN.d/S* get run when runlevel N is entered and they are given the `start' argument
[01:56] <shadowman> i'll check for u
[01:56] <dustin> Hello , I am curious on how to make a luancher for a wine application on my desktop could someone help me?
[01:56] <ic56> facugaich: the /etc/rcN.d/K* scripts are all also run but with a `stop' argument
[01:56] <dooglus> amphi: they're selling media - it makes sense that they'll DRM to it stop people sharing it
[01:56] <dustin> please!
[01:56] <hollywoodb> kikoala: description says k7 is for athlon/duron, but I doubt you'd notice any difference between that & 686
[01:56] <leojstewart> amphi: no, they don't use open codecs, i don't think
[01:56] <dooglus> amphi: if people are willing to put up with DRM, then the media companies will use it
[01:56] <leojstewart> amphi: my torrent site does :)
[01:57] <kikoala> Do you know if there are any stability issues between the two?
[01:57] <amphi> leojstewart: ahh, sorry, I misunderstood, ditto dooglus
[01:57] <kikoala> Would it be a safer bet to stick to the k7 arch?
[01:57] <amphi> dooglus: exactly
[01:57] <leojstewart> dooglus: they promise to support support other formats soon, though
[01:58] <amphi> Drac[Server] : not that I've seen
[01:58] <ic56> facugaich: if the existing scripts are too complex, shall I walk you through creating a new (small) one?
[01:58] <hollywoodb> kikoala: they're almost identical, k7 should use extensions that are amd-specific as well as all the 686 stuff
[01:58] <amphi> Drac[Server] : but I haven't had really full partitions >80%
[01:58] <kikoala> Excellent. Thanks, hollywood. I'll get to that.
[01:58] <elixter> I have this problem "ntfs_read_locked_inode(): Failed w ith error code -5. Marking corrupt inode 0x6 as bad. Run chkdsk." help!!!
[01:58] <leojstewart> I've heard there ARE hacks to watch DRM.  Is this just heresay?
[01:58] <kikoala> I appreciate it.
[01:59] <dooglus> leojstewart: "DRM" covers a bunch of different systems.  there may be hacks for some of them, but not all.
[01:59] <Clint-> back
[01:59] <Clint-> hey all
[01:59] <sip> would any some one writte for me the espahish channel please...
[01:59] <Clint-> hey amphi
[01:59] <amphi> !es
[01:59] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[01:59] <leojstewart> dooglus: I don't think I quite understand how DRM works :P
[01:59] <amphi> hi Clint-
[01:59] <sip> tks
[01:59] <Clint-> I want ot add, soft, whatever, to make my battery life last long, and get my wireless working bud, I came back to ubuntu, sorry for what i had said
[01:59] <majd> is there a program that lets me stream my music over the internet?
[01:59] <facugaich> ic56, I'd really aprecciate that. But before that, I was thinking there may be an easier way. In a tutorial I read that I should add those commands to "rc.local", but that was for another distro. Any equivalent in ubuntu?
[01:59] <amphi> sip: de nada ;)
[01:59] <Clint-> I'll be ordering apparel, soon :)
[02:00] <amphi> Clint-: what did you say?
[02:00] <elixter> how about this : " Shell "find /home/$USER | grep '.mp3' > file.txt && date >> file.txt" " <<<< why doesn't this shit work
[02:00] <elixter> ?
[02:00] <Drac[Server] > amphi: Well I have about 80% full here on this 120GB 7200RPM hard drive, and my distro runs very slow despite that decent hardware of an AMD Athlon XP 1200 and 256MB DDR...
[02:00] <dooglus> leojstewart: it's just encryption.  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management for more info
[02:00] <ericz> clint-: ubuntu apparel? heh.. i'm wearing a ubuntu golf shirt as we speak
[02:00] <Ratzilla> i tried changing my hostname..but everytime i boot up again it changes back...is there more to it than just sudo hostname <new_hostname> ?
[02:01] <mnt_guy> how can you recover sound in ubuntu kde? I lost sound and no matter what I do it will just look like its playing, but no sound
[02:01] <amphi> Drac[Server] : is it swapping much? that's not much ram these days
[02:01] <leojstewart> dooglus: thanks for the link - will give it a read.
[02:01] <amphi> Ratzilla: edit /etc/hostname
[02:01] <ic56> facugaich: no, rc.local is the BSD style of doing things.  I hear Slackware Linux uses it too.  Was the other distro Slackware?
[02:01] <Drac[Server] > amphi: Actually, it's not swapping much at all. :\
[02:01] <amphi> Drac[Server] : what's slow? disk access? everything?
[02:02] <Ratzilla> amphi: thank you
[02:02] <Clint-> oh nice :)
[02:02] <facugaich> ic56, no, Fedora Core I think
[02:02] <dooglus> leojstewart: probably the most famous type of DRM is on DVDs.  Most commercial DVDs are encrypted, and can't be played by open source DVD players without using some questionable code that breaks the encryption
[02:02] <Clint-> I said, I'm sorry for all the talk on FreeBSD, and stuff, and saying ubuntu was not fast enough for me, even though I don't have to appologize, I want to make things right :-)
[02:02] <ic56> facugaich: oh?  A friend runs that.  Let me login and check.
[02:02] <Tom39Away> Every time I run an update that updates my kernal, my grub menu gets messed up.  Specifically, the "root (hd0,0)" line that works always gets changed back to "root (hd1,0)".  How can I make it stay (hd0,0) ?
[02:02] <amphi> Clint-: oh, I must have missed those ravings ;)
[02:02] <Drac[Server] > amphi: I would imagine disk access, but that kind of makes everything slow, really.
[02:03] <Clint-> now I'm going, instal sysv-rc-conf  and edit run levels, hey amphi , whats the best way to go about stopping a services, and make sure the kernel doesn't load it at startup
[02:03] <Rug> amphi: I just commented out the gatewaydev line, and it hosed my connection.  Something is using it.
[02:03] <Clint-> yep :-)
[02:03] <ic56> facugaich: never mind. I can't reach his box at the moment.
[02:03] <drgonzo> hello all
[02:03] <amphi> Rug: oh, well
[02:03] <drgonzo> Is there any estimates on the ubuntu userbase?
[02:03] <Rug> hehe that's easy for you to say
[02:03] <saif> ok, just did an lspci, and there is an entry for firewire IEEE 1394, does it mean that if i buy an external drive it will work? because my broadcom 4318 is also listed there, but it doesnt work! :)
[02:03] <Clint-> amphi, , I consider you a friend of mine :-)
[02:03] <facugaich> ic56, its ok. I guess I'll have to make one of those scripts
[02:03] <Rug> drgonzo: 3 or 4
[02:03] <dustin> Anyone help me with icons in ubuntu? how would i create my own icon
[02:03] <drgonzo> I'm seeing daily updates from 40/60 plus packages that's rather impressive
[02:03] <amphi> Clint-: you are most kind
[02:04] <leojstewart> dooglus: I see.  Well, I tried to download a 'highlight' reel from a recent game on MediaZone.  I think it was encrypted with DRM like their full releases, because the sound wouldn't play, and the screen was completely unreadable.
[02:04] <Clint-> ty
[02:04] <ericz> how can i convert ogg to mp3? my portable mp3 player only appreciates mp3 and wma :/
[02:04] <anthony> hi, i'm having trouble mounting a hard drive
[02:04] <drgonzo> that or is there an expected release soon?
[02:04] <dooglus> Rug: it's definitely more than that.  It's at least 6.
[02:04] <Clint-> I think we get along good :-)
[02:04] <Tedd> dustin, I'm sure you can find some resources on www.gnome-look.com
[02:04] <Rug> dooglus: you might be right
[02:04] <leojstewart> dooglus: is there no way to get past something like that?

[02:05] <Clint-> now to get my wireless working... amphi , is ndiswrapper installed in breezy, or, um, should i dist-upgrade first, that wouldn't stop me from being able to set up ndiswraper successfully eh, and, um..
[02:05] <amphi> "The number of UNIX installations has grown to ten, with more expected" ;)
[02:05] <drgonzo> anyway keep up the great work fellas
[02:05] <drgonzo> later
[02:05] <dooglus> leojstewart: past what?  it's illegal (in the US) to decrypt DVDs without a license to do so.  Whether it's technically possible or not doesn't matter - it's illegal.

[02:06] <ericz> anybody know how to convert ogg to mp3?
[02:06] <mnt_guy> a paste by a bot against pasting  lol
[02:06] <elixter> i like to bo on top :D you know what i mean :D
[02:06] <amphi> dooglus: whether it is technically possible does indeed matter rather a lot, IMHO ;)
[02:06] <leojstewart> dooglus: well, it's not a DVD.  But it uses the same type of encryption, I think.  Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but is there some way, illegal or not, to decrypt the protection on this downloaded video?
[02:06] <ic56> facugaich: ok, we'll keep the instructions simple then.  First, just to make sure we aren't going down the wrong path, tell me exactly the commands you want to run.  If there's too many, use pastebin

[02:06] <Rug> Elixter, you are now on /ignore.  I suggest the rest of the channel follow suit
[02:07] <amphi> leojstewart: you need to find out exactly what it is, and consult google, I reckon; there might be info on the mplayer site
[02:07] <eja> Rug, only in your dreams =\
[02:07] <elixter> ignore ?
[02:07] <Tedd> dustin, have you checked their forums
[02:07] <leojstewart> dooglus: the video I'm referring to is here: http://download1.mediazone.com/media/downloads/rugby/previewhighlights/2006/e-hl_3283.wmv
[02:07] <facugaich> ic56: "modprobe br2684" "br2684ctl -c 0 -b -a 0.33" "ifconfig nas0 up"
[02:07] <leojstewart> dooglus: would you know how would go about finding the exact encryption of the movie?
[02:07] <Rug> eja: Just a suggestion.  If he can't be kicked, the next best thing is to ignore him
[02:07] <dooglus> leojstewart: the other great thing about US law is that even if I knew how to help you decrypt it, it's illegal for me to help you!  :)
[02:07] <anthony> i have a slave hdd that i'm trying to mount - how do i go about doing so?
[02:08] <dustin> Tedd, www.gnome-look.com is a reserved site with nothing there
[02:08] <ic56> facugaich: looks good.  What's your favourite editor?
[02:08] <leojstewart> dooglus: heh, okay.
[02:08] <facugaich> ic56, gedit
[02:08] <Tedd> dustin, My bad, dude. It was www.gnome-look.org
[02:08] <mnt_guy> is there an equvilent to alsa config in ubuntu to get a via onboard sound card going?
[02:08] <dustin> ;) thanks heh
[02:08] <dooglus> leojstewart: read all about the law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act
[02:08] <elixter> but i'm not ignored
[02:08] <elixter> :D:D
[02:09] <dustin> anyone know how to end a process if nothing is responding?
[02:09] <ic56> facugaich: Do this: sudo gedit /etc/init.d/net-module
[02:09] <Flannel> dustin: switch terminals and kill it
[02:09] <anthony> dustin: there's a button on the front of your computer :)
[02:09] <leojstewart> dooglus: reading (thanks for the link, again)
[02:09] <dustin> this x chat is the only program responding
[02:09] <Clint-> hey amphi , ubuntu in here, my fav person :-)
[02:09] <mnt_guy> cntrl-alt-del to log out   or  cntrl-alt-esc  to bring up xkill
[02:09] <elixter> Rug: you allmost got me there! :D You little prankster, I love you :D
[02:09] <Flannel> dustin: ctrl-alt-f1 doesnt switch you to a tty?
[02:09] <Clint-> :P
[02:10] <facugaich> ic56: it just created the file, is taht ok?
[02:10] <amphi> leojstewart: "Selected video codec: [wmv9dmo]  vfm: dmo (Windows Media Video 9 DMO)" quoth mplayer before displaying silent garbage ;)
[02:10] <ic56> facugaich: put a 1st line like this: "#!/bin/sh" and then the commands you told me about, one on each line.
[02:10] <Clint-> guess what, we need to put, VMware available , in next, ubuntu release and breezy repositories,
[02:10] <ic56> facugaich: yes, new file is what we wanted.
[02:10] <Clint-> because not only is it free, but people can run Windows or any OS inside ubuntu, hassle free :P
[02:10] <Clint-> VMware Player*
[02:10] <Clint-> ^_^
[02:11] <shadeofgrey> since when is vmware free?
[02:11] <amphi> Clint-: there's qemu which is Free as opposed to free
[02:11] <Clint-> and then, any user can run a fluxbox, adn then via vmware lOL and have a tightly secure infrastructure environment :P
[02:11] <ic56> facugaich: You might also want to put some comments (beginning with a # ) so later you'll know what this file is about.  But the #!/bin/sh must remain the first line.
[02:11] <facugaich> ic56: done
[02:11] <Clint-> amphi, , VMware Player is free lOL
[02:11] <Clint-> since a while ago LOL
[02:11] <dooglus> leojstewart: that's a windows media DRM file.  "Windows Media DRM is designed to be renewable, that is, it is designed on the assumption that it will be cracked and must be constantly updated by Microsoft. The result is that while the scheme has been cracked several times, it has usually not remained cracked for long."
[02:11] <Clint-> I forget when player came out :P
[02:11] <amphi> Clint-: it is not free software
[02:11] <Clint-> yes it is lol
[02:11] <Flannel> Guys, take teh DRM, and VM stuff to #ubuntu-offtopic please.
[02:11] <ic56> facugaich: save but we're not done. there's more to do.
[02:11] <Clint-> www.vmware.com
[02:12] <amphi> Clint-: you have the source?
[02:12] <Clint-> it just don't have all the controls VMware Workstation, server etc does, howeve ri bought Vmware workstation from vmware llol
[02:12] <Clint-> amphi,  I can get it lol.
[02:12] <Clint-> what do I need to prove to you ubuntu closed minded, that things alway shave tobe free lol...
[02:12] <Clint-> :P
[02:12] <facugaich> ic56: ok
[02:12] <Clint-> 1 day, amphi , your going see me, flying pass Bill GAtes :)
[02:12] <Clint-> with my A.I. System :-0
[02:12] <Clint-> :_
[02:12] <Clint-> :)
[02:13] <Flannel> Clint-: take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:13] <Clint-> I going call it.. Linux A.I.
[02:13] <Clint-> :D
[02:13] <Clint-> Flannel, , its summer.. :P
[02:13] <ic56> facugaich: next do this: "sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/net-module" finally, do this: "sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/net-module /etc/rc0.d/S21net-module"
[02:13] <Flannel> Clint-: and this is a help channel, not for general discussion.
[02:13] <Clint-> oh yes, I forgot to join the channel, where not too much negative energy goin on, oh yep my fault ;)
[02:13] <leojstewart> dooglus: thanks for the help :)
[02:13] <Clint-> well, ubuntu site says otherwise o.o
[02:14] <leojstewart> dooglus: I'll see what I can do.
[02:14] <Clint-> Flannel, , I having a bad day, I lost my dog :(
[02:14] <ericz> how can i convert .ogg's to .mp3 ?
[02:14] <facugaich> ok
[02:14] <Flannel> Clint-: where does it say otherwise?
[02:14] <ic56> facugaich: ok. To briefly explain what we did: /etc/init.d is where the reference copy of every startup script is kept.  The scripts aren't actually invoked from that directory.  That's just the central place where they're kept.  The rc.d directories are where you put scripts that you actually want executed.  Each of these directories is used for a different "run level".  For example, booting in single-user mode, puts you 
[02:14] <Clint-> I show ya
[02:14] <Clint-> ;)
[02:15] <Flannel> Clint-: Lets take this to -offtopic
[02:15] <Clint-> I talked with Mark once,
[02:15] <Juhaz> Clint-, no doubt it couldn't stand your "company" either.
[02:15] <Clint-> :D
[02:15] <Clint-> :(
[02:15] <ic56> facugaich: when you proceed to go into multiuser mode, without the GUI, you go into runlevel 2.  When the GUI starts, you're in level 3.  To ensure the fan is turned on regardless of which level you're booting to, we created links to the script from each of the directories.
[02:16] <dudanogueira> please, im having trouble in sincronizing my palm zire 72 with ubuntu

[02:17] <sss> anyone can help me.
[02:17] <facugaich> ic56, one part of what you were saying was cut-off, after the "booting is single-user mode, puts you..."
[02:17] <ic56> facugaich: come to think of it, let's change that name to /etc/rc0.d/S34net-module -- "34" so it's run just before the S35 networking script.  BTW, a better name than "module" would be good.  Something descriptive like "wireless" or whatever it is that module is used for.

[02:20] <ic56> facugaich: the initial "S" is for Start.  a K is for Kill.  In the case of your script, there's only a S action.  To include a K action, we'd need a more complex script.  The number after the initial letter tells the init daemon in what sequence to invoke the scripts. Numbers are 00 - 99.
[02:20] <MrRio> sss, Can you write down the exact error message?
[02:21] <Phoul> Excuse me
[02:21] <Phoul> Im trying to play a .mpc file
[02:21] <Phoul> Is there something i need so it will play
[02:21] <ic56> facugaich: you're welcome. good luck!
[02:21] <sss> spikeb:Now the ubuntu-cn IRC no one is in.
[02:22] <spikeb> sss: i'm sorry
[02:22] <MrRio> Phoul: I think you need libmpcdec3
[02:22] <Flannel> sss: if you don't mind help in english, you're welcome to stay here, of course.
[02:22] <Tu13es__> I'm trying to set up an account so a friend can use my rig to run his Java program.  I know I need to set up SSH, but I have NFI how.  Can anyone help?
[02:22] <Opopanax> hey, how come i can't find acroread in multiverse f/breezy?
[02:22] <sss> MrRio: The message tell me that DCOP's communication is wrong.
[02:22] <facugaich> ic56: one more thing though, this commands need to be run after another module is loaded. This module is loaded with the "modules" file
[02:23] <sss> Flannel:  I can read some simple English.
[02:23] <Flannel> Opopanax: it's there.
[02:23] <Opopanax> masked somehow?
[02:23] <Flannel> Opopanax: nope.  acroread is the package.
[02:24] <amphi> sss: that's a kde error, you might have more luck in #kubuntu
[02:24] <shadowman> back
[02:24] <shadowman> ;] 
[02:24] <ian_s> Does Mark Shuttleworth every come in here? :)
[02:24] <spikeb> Opopanax: are you on i386?
[02:24] <spikeb> ian_s: yeah
[02:24] <Opopanax> no, x86_64
[02:24] <ian_s> ooo shweet
[02:24] <Opopanax> ah, that's it.
=== ian_s is now known as Ian_S
[02:24] <blaze> i've just installed ubuntu, how to update the kernel?
[02:24] <spikeb> Opopanax: i dont think acroread is available for any arch but i386
[02:24] <blaze> (i've forgotten :) )
[02:25] <ic56> facugaich: hang on, I'm investigating
[02:25] <shadowman> apt-get update kernel
[02:25] <Opopanax> argh.
[02:25] <sss> amphi:  How can I mend this problem?
[02:25] <shadowman> :D
[02:25] <Opopanax> okie dokie
[02:25] <blaze> ok shadowman 10x
[02:25] <spikeb> Opopanax: yeah im stuck without it as well (ppc here)
[02:25] <Opopanax> but stuff like xpdf and whatnot will work fine, no?
[02:25] <spikeb> Opopanax: yeah it should
[02:25] <amphi> sss: I don't know. I don't use kde. People in #kubuntu channel might know
[02:25] <spikeb> Opopanax: gnome's evince works alright as well
[02:25] <Opopanax> okie dokie
[02:25] <Opopanax> kubuntu on my friend's box
[02:25] <shadowman> bah
[02:26] <shadowman> KDE :/
[02:26] <Opopanax> just built her a 64-bit sempron 2800+ machine for less than 300
[02:26] <amphi> Opopanax: you can help sss with his dcop error?
[02:26] <sss> OK thank you any way.
[02:26] <shadowman> gnome is a interface for reel linux users ha!
[02:26] <shadowman> but..
[02:26] <amphi> shadowman: that'd be gnu screen ;)
[02:26] <shadowman> text mode is more useful :P
[02:26] <Opopanax> g-nome is for g-geeks
[02:26] <sss> The wrong message is :" Could not open network socket  ".
[02:26] <DMJC> anyone tried installing ubuntu 5.10 on nvidia card?
[02:26] <Opopanax> :-)  what's the problem w/dcop?
[02:26] <DMJC> *cards
[02:26] <shadowman> gnome is the shit
[02:27] <Opopanax> i concur
[02:27] <spikeb> i love gnome :)
[02:27] <shadowman> :)
[02:27] <shadowman> simple and fast - gnome
[02:27] <cubikdice> I <3 Gnome
[02:27] <Opopanax> dmjc, you should have no problem
[02:27] <amphi> sss: just a thought, does 'ifconfig -a' show interface 'lo' is up?
[02:27] <Opopanax> nforce works great
[02:27] <DMJC> every box I've tried it on with nvidia gfx comes up in a blue screen
[02:27] <DMJC> try to install the binary driver and the system hasn't installed GCC or binutils
[02:27] <Opopanax> sss, what's the problem, start from the beginning
[02:27] <sss> The wrong message title is :"DCOP communication is wrong."
[02:28] <DMJC> cd doesn't even have the copy of gcc that was used to build the kernel
[02:28] <Opopanax> what are you trying to do when it does that, sss
[02:28] <DMJC> have to get into console change to vesa mode
[02:28] <shadowman> binutils! yeah thanks DMJC
[02:28] <DMJC> just to get into the gui
[02:28] <shadowman> :))
[02:28] <shadowman> i forgot what that package is called
[02:28] <shadowman> :D
[02:28] <DMJC> it really pisses me off that distros don't just boot into vesa and offer a choice of gfx driver from there
[02:29] <DMJC> much simpler
[02:29] <shadowman> lol
[02:29] <shadowman> not what, how
[02:29] <Rug> I need some helpo with a very simple script.  Can anybody suggest if/what I need to make it better:   http://pastebin.com/734263
[02:29] <Opopanax> dmjc...you have that choice with gentoo...
[02:29] <spikeb> DMJC: the theory is that they should be able to figure out which driver to use
[02:29] <DMJC> but seriously... gcc 4.0 but no gcc 3.3.4 which the kernel was built with?
[02:29] <sss> Opopanax:When I start my compute ,there a wrong message appear.It tell me that DCOP's Communication is wrong.
[02:29] <DMJC> the hell?
[02:29] <DMJC> NV oss driver is a piece of crap
[02:29] <Opopanax> dmjc, have you installed nvidia-glx?
[02:29] <DMJC> yes
[02:30] <Opopanax> the oss driver has come a long way, though, it really hass
[02:30] <DMJC> nvidia-glx won't do much without nvidia.ko
[02:30] <shadowman> this driver works for my bud
[02:30] <amphi> DMJC: I agree the compiler version is 'curious' ;)
[02:30] <Opopanax> DMJC, did you change the driver in xorg.conf to "nvidia" instead of "nv"
[02:30] <shadowman> btw any1 from Poland? =P
[02:30] <MrRio> DMJC: install nvidia-glx thru apt, don't bother getting it from nvidia.com
[02:30] <ndlovu> on one computer I can install dvdrecord, but not the other - how do I check what repo it's in?
[02:30] <DMJC> have to rebuild the kernel heh and there was even more BS when doing that lol
[02:30] <Blue89> I want to set up printer sharing over my network with a windows machine. I am having problems getting smb to work properly and suspect that the print server is not permitting the other computers to read it's list of clients. how do I specify the ip address of the print server and browse it's resources without a name?
[02:30] <DMJC> Opopanax changing it to nvidia won't do anything if you can't build nvidia.ko
[02:31] <Opopanax> sss--i recommend that you open up adept and do a full upgrade.
[02:31] <Opopanax> then reboot, see what happens
[02:31] <ic56> facugaich: maybe rcS.d would be more appropriate.  The modules are loaded from /etc/rcS.d/S20modutils .  Since you want yours to load after the others,  you could name it S21...  Mind you, a cleaner way would be to put your module in /etc/modules from where it would be automatically picked up and, if the networking scripts don't automatically detect the new interface and bring it up, then modify the networking script.  You
[02:31] <DMJC> the driver module itself wouldn't compie.. heh
[02:31] <DMJC> no net access
[02:31] <Opopanax> DMJC, what's preventing you from compiling nvidia.ko?
[02:31] <DMJC> you'd think they could get the install cd right
[02:31] <DMJC> the install cd only has gcc 4.0
[02:31] <DMJC> ubuntu's kernel was built with gcc 3.3.4
[02:31] <Blue89> I know that typing \\192.168.2.13\ in windows explorer showed me such a list including the shared printer
[02:31] <sss> Opopanax: I reboot so many times. But the problem is again.
[02:32] <amphi> DMJC: mind you, you don't need 3d accel to get on the 'net  ;)
[02:32] <DMJC> and you need the same compiler version to build the kernel module
[02:32] <DMJC> true amphi
[02:32] <Opopanax> DMJC, i just installed nvidia, and it compiled the headers without any problem
[02:32] <cackette> hey
[02:32] <DMJC> but it'd be nice t at least get a booting distro
[02:32] <facugaich> ic56: the last sentence was cut off lol
[02:32] <DMJC> instead of a blue screen
[02:32] <shadowman> hey cackette
[02:32] <sip> hola
[02:32] <cackette> Can someone try to see if they can connect to my SSH @ 24.23.28.8
[02:32] <DMJC> nv driver doesn't work on 6600 gfx cards
[02:32] <MrRio> DMJC: I've never had a blue screen with my nvidia cards before
[02:33] <ic56> facugaich: if the networking scripts don't automatically detect the new interface and bring it up, then modify the networking script.  You could try that.
[02:33] <cackette> so it doesn't take me days to troubleshoot
[02:33] <DMJC> only on the OSS nv driver
[02:33] <shadowman> DMJC: bullshit
[02:33] <ericz> cackette, i can connect
[02:33] <sss> The  wrong message is :" "DCOP communication problem(konqueror)  , Could not open network socket  "
[02:33] <cackette> ok thanks
[02:33] <cackette> I was gonna use it today @ school
[02:33] <Opopanax> sss, right...but did you upgrade before you rebooted? are you on breezy or hoary or what?  what version of KDE are you using?  did you just try to install kde on top of ubuntu, or are you using kubuntu?
[02:33] <Flannel> cackette: yeah, it connects
[02:33] <cackette> but DHCP changed my IP :(
[02:33] <DMJC> shadowman: what version of ubuntu you using?
[02:33] <Opopanax> sss we need more information
[02:33] <DMJC> for the INSTALL cd..
[02:33] <facugaich> ic56, ok, I'll see what can I do
[02:33] <shadowman> i installed nv-glx on gf 6600GT and it worked fine
[02:33] <cackette> so the ports ended up being incorrectly forwarded
[02:33] <ic56> facugaich: hang on -- phone
[02:34] <cackette> due to DHCP changing from .5  to .6
[02:34] <cackette> now its static though
[02:34] <shadowman> umm win xp sp2 =P
[02:34] <Opopanax> DMJC, if you want i'd be happy to ssh into your box and poke around
[02:34] <shadowman> but i did it on ubuntu 5.02
[02:34] <shadowman> or smth like that
[02:34] <shadowman> ;] 
[02:34] <shadowman> without any problems
[02:34] <DMJC> actually this isn't about my box heh
[02:34] <DMJC> I'm running gentoo with everything nice and tweaked
[02:34] <Flannel> cackette: I imagine youre behind a router?  You can probably config for static IP.  That's what the common solution is.
[02:34] <DMJC> some guy I was doing support for yesterday was totally boned tho
[02:34] <Opopanax> did you follow the nvidia howto on the wiki?  it should work every time
[02:34] <shadowman> gentoo's nice
[02:35] <amphi> DMJC: boned?
[02:35] <DMJC> I've been using this stuff for 6 years and I've never had as much weirdness as yesterday
[02:35] <shadowman> but very anoying to install
[02:35] <Opopanax> DMJC, i'm a gentoo man myself
[02:35] <sss> I am in dapper.My version of KDE is 3.x. I install KDE and Gnome in my computer.
[02:35] <shadowman> i'm too lazy for gentoo
[02:35] <shadowman> =P
=== Opopanax is now known as opopanaxgentoo
[02:35] <DMJC> gentoo's great on an ath64 X2 4400+
[02:35] <opopanaxgentoo> so i've heard
[02:35] <DMJC> stage 1 to gnome built in 6 hours
[02:35] <opopanaxgentoo> i'm gonna upgrade...soon
[02:35] <amphi> sss: dapper? ask in #ubuntu+1
[02:35] <shadowman> um
[02:35] <DMJC> I've done it here hehehe
[02:35] <Blue89> shadowman, me too, I had gentoo untill I could not get opengl.
[02:35] <shadowman> how to change my nick?
[02:36] <shadowman> :D
[02:36] <DMJC> couldn't get OpenGL?
[02:36] <Blue89>  /nick
[02:36] <amphi> shadowman: /nick foo
[02:36] <opopanaxgentoo> my current project is openldap/samba...i hate openldap now.  it's a nightmare
[02:36] <shadowman> danke
[02:36] <shadowman> ;] 
[02:36] <amphi> bitte
[02:36] <Blue89> DMJC, portage would not emerge what I wanted
=== shadowman is now known as [dev] shadow
[02:36] <[dev] shadow> =] 
[02:36] <opopanaxgentoo> Blue89, what was stopping opengl?
[02:36] <DMJC> the most annoying thing with that stuff yesterday was if the ubuntu install cd had the right gcc version I could've had nvidia 3d up in 2 secs
[02:36] <dli> any good thinkpad howto for ubuntu?
[02:36] <DMJC> Blue89: lemme guess... a masked nvidiai package/version?
[02:37] <gilianima> are there applications on the Net that use CONS (connection oriented network service) ?
[02:37] <amphi> dli: probably at linux-laptop.net - what model?
[02:37] <Blue89> I think so
[02:37] <ic56> facugaich: the more I think about it, the more I think changing the config read by modutils is the better solution.  Try removing the script from /etc/rc?.d (it can stay in init.d -- that's never read) and just adding the module's name in /etc/modules .  See if the ifconfig is automatically done as a result.
[02:37] <opopanaxgentoo> DMJC, i'm not getting it...i was using a stock kernel the other day, and nvidia compiled just fine
=== [dev] shadow is now known as shadowman
[02:37] <dli> amphi, t60
[02:37] <DMJC> gentoo seems to be too cautious with package masks sometimes
[02:37] <shadowman> that's better
[02:37] <shadowman> :D
[02:37] <amphi> dli: ooh, is it nice?
[02:37] <DMJC> esp on amd64
[02:37] <dli> amphi, quite silly at linux-laptop.net
[02:37] <DMJC> hehehe
[02:37] <shadowman> oh guys
[02:37] <amphi> dli: nothing?
[02:37] <opopanaxgentoo> DMJC, sometimes, yeah...or they can't keep maintainers to keep up with the ebuilds
[02:37] <DMJC> so tempted to start a distro based on debian though
[02:37] <shadowman> what do u think about BSD's?
[02:37] <dli> amphi, yes, hardware is okay, but lenovo doesn't support linux :(
[02:37] <facugaich> ic56, ok, but I'll have to reboot
[02:37] <KyoLptp`> Can anyone recommend a bit torrent client?
[02:37] <DMJC> so many people I know want to try linux but hate the install procedures
[02:38] <Blue89> DMJC, cool
[02:38] <sss> Thank you everyone .I have to leave and go to class.
[02:38] <opopanaxgentoo> bye sss, have fun
[02:38] <amphi> dli: I have a T42 here, with debian on it - everything works
[02:38] <shadowman> debian is easy to install thought
[02:38] <dli> amphi, two entries there, no advanced info, I want dual boot
[02:38] <DMJC> X configuration especially
[02:38] <DMJC> all the people I know run either nvidia or ati
[02:38] <DMJC> nothing else
[02:38] <dli> amphi, I know hardware support is okay
[02:38] <shadowman> u run ati
[02:38] <KyoLptp`> I run intel, DMJC :p
[02:38] <DMJC> only other time is laptop gfx
[02:38] <amphi> dli: that's just grub config
[02:38] <shadowman> i*
[02:38] <ic56> facugaich: if the ifconfig doesn't auto-run, look through the files in /etc/modutils/ which is where (I think) additional commands get placed for each module.  Yeah, you'll have to reboot to test this.
[02:38] <shadowman> damn
[02:39] <DMJC> KyoLptp`, laptop right?
[02:39] <shadowman> i'm sleepy
[02:39] <KyoLptp`> <.<;;
[02:39] <amphi> dli: you have ubuntu installed already?
[02:39] <Blue89> DMJC, make it fast if you can
[02:39] <dli> amphi, no, planning
[02:39] <facugaich> ic56: ok, how do I check if the ifconfig was tun?
[02:39] <facugaich> run*
[02:39] <DMJC> hehehe
[02:39] <DMJC> can HAL detect gfx cards properly yet?
[02:39] <amphi> dli: and you want to keep the legacy os that's on there already?
[02:40] <shadowman> u r typing too fast for me
[02:40] <shadowman> so i'm off to sleep
[02:40] <dli> amphi, want to keep the mbr features, how to get it done that way?
[02:40] <DMJC> I'd like to see an app for HAL that detects gfx card and for ati/nvidia can download/install the closed drivers
[02:40] <shadowman> gnite linux lovers =P
[02:40] <Blue89> gnite
[02:40] <ic56> facugaich: as an ordinary user, type "ifconfig -a".  It will list all the known neteworking interfaces and their current state.  What was the ifconfig command you were using?
[02:40] <facugaich> ic56, "ifconfig nas0 up"
[02:40] <amphi> dli: what mbr features? I booted mine off a cd, removed and redid the partition tables, and installed debian on it ;)
[02:41] <dli> amphi, then, the access ibm button doesn't work, it's within mbr
[02:41] <DMJC> one question
[02:41] <amphi> propertytarians, heh
[02:41] <opopanaxgentoo> DMJC that would make bootup impossibly long
[02:41] <DMJC> when you refer to NV-GLX
[02:41] <dli> amphi, does it?
[02:41] <Michael`123> Hello (again). I have been in here about 6 times, and I still cannot get my Ubuntu installation to dual boot with WinXP. Basically, it goes like this: I install Ubuntu, it says it detects WinXP and asks if I want to install to MBR, I say yes, and reboot, and GRUB is not there. I posted some screenshots, tons of information, etc, on the problem here, but no one has been able to solve my issue yet: http://ubuntuforums.org/showth
[02:41] <Michael`123> read.php?t=179908 -- Help would be GREATLY appreciated. It has been about a week trying to get Ubuntu to work alongside Windows now.
[02:41] <Michael`123> ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=179908 )
[02:41] <DMJC> is that the open source driver?
[02:41] <DMJC> or the closed one?
[02:41] <ic56> facugaich: ok. if things go well, then ifconfig -a should (1) list "nas0" in it's output and (2) report that it is "UP"
[02:41] <DMJC> opopanaxgentoo? why?
[02:41] <amphi> dli: I have the access ibm button spawn an xterm in X, couldn't think of anything for it to do in console ;)
[02:41] <opopanaxgentoo> DMJC i'm just talking about the whole banana, the proprietary driver + the kernel headers
[02:41] <facugaich> ic56: ok, going to reboot
[02:42] <ic56> facugaich: good luck.
[02:42] <opopanaxgentoo> well, for one, it's not HAL's job to install drivers
[02:42] <DMJC> opopanaxgentoo: simple, make system boot to vesa gfx mode
[02:42] <DMJC> then a nice gui pops up asking if you want to taint your kernel in X
[02:42] <dli> amphi, good, how to do it? never played with thinkpad before
[02:42] <DMJC> I know
[02:43] <DMJC> I was asking about using HAL to detect if you have an ati/nvidia driver
[02:43] <Blue89> DMJC, is it possible to use portage in ubuntu? gentoo has a few packages that are not in synaptic
[02:43] <DMJC> *card not driver sorry
[02:43] <tate> hello, has anyone here used ubuntu to run an ldap server?
[02:43] <amphi> dli: tpb package
=== Michael`123 is now known as technel
[02:43] <Xbox_guru> will modprobing every type of driver for a soundcard effect the performance or sound
[02:43] <dli> amphi, great :)
[02:43] <DMJC> Blue89: i'd assume it could be rigged in but itd take a fair bit of work
[02:43] <amphi> dli: there is also an ibm-acpi module for trapping stinkpad specific acpi events with acpid, and some other /proc stuff
[02:44] <dli> amphi, considering gentoo now, it's more flexible, and it's a dual core cpu, got to exploit that
[02:44] <amphi> dli: you have those 'non-standard' page-left and page-right keys?
[02:44] <amphi> dli: install an smp kernel
[02:44] <Blue89> it was easier to use portage when it worked, just emerge --search "^f", emerge foo
[02:44] <tate> portage is fantastic
[02:44] <tate> I miss it
[02:45] <dli> amphi, I mean, I can exploit the smp with gentoo emerging
[02:45] <amphi> dli: pfft, just run two povray instances or something ;)
[02:45] <dli> amphi, yes, "make -j3 "
[02:46] <amphi> dli: yeah, I understood that, but you could use your cores for something more useful IMHO
[02:46] <technel> So, yeah, help would be GREATLY appreciated.

[02:49] <dli> amphi, don't know what that mean? higher enter key? couldn't see any difference
[02:49] <facugaich> ic56: that didn't work, because I've got to run another command after loading "br2684" for the nas0 interface to be created
[02:49] <Xbox_guru> what folder can I find all my modules in
[02:49] <cmatheson> hey guys, i like to listen to my music in ogg on my computer, but i need mp3 for the cd player... i would like to rip my music to flac and then convert to mp3/ogg as i go along.. are there any scripts/programs to do this that will also preserver the artist/title/etc. data?
[02:50] <ic56> facugaich: we can put that command in a config file.  did the module get loaded?  "lsmod" should list it.
[02:50] <amphi> dli: heh, I used mprime from there for testing undervolting my cpu
[02:51] <facugaich> ic56: yes it did, I wouldn't be using xchat if it hadn't ;)
[02:51] <amphi> dli: large, tall, not just similar to the backspace key
[02:51] <dli> amphi, definitely not double height
[02:52] <amphi> dli: damn
[02:52] <amphi> dli: but it has the funky page-left and page-right keys by the arrow keys?
[02:53] <yukonho> I've got a really stubborn HD that just refuses to have its partition resized.  The ubuntu installer didn't work, and neither did GParted (off the breezy or the 6.06 live cd) or qtparted off the linusx system rescue cd.  What are my other options after that?  It's a 40GB maxtor fat32 formatted drive.  I've already cleaned it up and completely defragmented it.
[02:53] <Ratzilla> after you resize you gotta use fdisk to set the different segments
[02:53] <Ratzilla> i had a friend do it for me but it wasnt successful
[02:54] <yukonho> I can't even get it resized, though
[02:54] <yukonho> I'
[02:54] <Ratzilla> it won't be resized until you set the beginning and end sectors
[02:54] <dli> amphi, yes, page-left/right are just above the left/right keys
[02:54] <amphi> yukonho: back up what's on it and repartition it?
[02:54] <ic56> facugaich: we're going into unfamiliar territory for me.  Checking some stuff.  Hang on.
[02:54] <facugaich> yukonho: PartitionMagic?
[02:54] <GaiaX11> How can i configure another linux computer lremotely? Through ssh?
[02:54] <amphi> dli: I find those very handy, for switching VTs in console, and workspaces in X
[02:54] <facugaich> ic56: take your time
[02:54] <Rug> cackette: GaiaX11 that is the best/easiest way
[02:54] <Rug> ack
[02:55] <Rug> GaiaX11: yes
[02:55] <nomin> is there an app for untuntu that can use a joystick/gamepad to emulate the keyboard and mouse?
[02:55] <dli> amphi, cool, I hope that works for Xgl
[02:55] <nomin> *for ubuntu
[02:55] <yukonho> I'd really love to keep the existing windows partition as-is.  Also, I'm looking for a free solution so I've kind of ruled out using PartitionMagic
[02:55] <dli> yukonho, parted can resize ntfs
[02:56] <yukonho> Will it do fat32 as well?
[02:56] <Rug> yukonho: how much free space do you have on that drive?
[02:56] <yukonho> Rug: I've got about 25GB free on a 40GB drive
[02:56] <Rug> ok good
[02:56] <facugaich> yukonho: Doesn't it have a trial period?
[02:57] <facugaich> ic56: I'm very sorry but I g2g. I'll put those other 2 commands in an initscript, after modutils maybe. What do you think?
[02:57] <ic56> facugaich: ok, try editing this file (it may not exist): sudo gedit /etc/modutils/actions
[02:57] <cubikdice> http://ftw.generation.no/img/internet-slang.jpg
[02:58] <ic56> facugaich: in that file put "post-install <your command>".  If it doesn't work, the init script solution is good enough.
[02:58] <nomin> qjoypad is not available on ubuntu yet.  I think it's a useful program.  It lets a joystick/controller emulate the keyboard and mouse:  http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/
[02:58] <facugaich> ic56: ok thanks you very very much. See you
[02:58] <ic56> facugaich: welcome! ttyl!
[02:59] <nomin> I hope someone can make it for ubuntu
[02:59] <MrRio> yukonho: I recommended the gparted livecd
[02:59] <MrRio> yukonho: its a dead handy thing to have around, and it only about 30MB i think
[02:59] <MrRio> yukonho: yep
[03:00] <yukonho> MrRio: Thanks, I'll check that out.  If I end up doing a complete wipe, will it be best to install windows first and then ubuntu?
[03:00] <amphi> dli: I'd imagine so

[03:17] <amphi> T`: why not?
[03:17] <torpedo|dog> hollywoodb, thanks for the pointer
[03:17] <amphi> T`: /usr/bin/dpkg doesn't work?

[03:18] <T`> amphi, there is no OS on that machine
[03:19] <aquadeluxe> md5sum -c md5sum.txt | grep -v 'OK$'
[03:19] <aquadeluxe> whoops
[03:19] <aquadeluxe> wrong thing

[03:20] <amphi> T`: ah... the sysresccd.org iso is useful for such things
[03:20] <torpedo|dog> I'm just trying to get so I can talk into my cheapo inbuilt microphone and record it.

[03:21] <andrejkw> Azuerus
[03:21] <amphi> T`: why do you need to make a vfat fs before installing an os?
[03:22] <T`> amphi, its some work related stuff..
[03:22] <KyoLptp`> Azureus is bloated and icky.
[03:22] <T`> amphi, writing a fat filesystem module.. heh
[03:22] <amphi> T`: uhuh
[03:22] <KyoLptp`> anything else? :/
[03:23] <T`> amphi, i dont need to installa nything on the fs.. just want to format .. see if it mounts, etc..
[03:23] <T`> amphi, you know how i can make sure if the filesystem was formated as FAT16, etc..?
[03:23] <T`> amphi, some kind of tool to display fs info..
[03:24] <ubuntutest> good night
[03:24] <open_shel1> Does anyone know if you can create an Icon on the desktop that will indicate the state of the Apache service. So that if you click it you can stop Apache or if its already stopped then start Apache?
[03:25] <amphi> T`: no; if you mount it, mount might say, but it'd probably just say 'vfat' ;)
[03:25] <T`> amphi, heh yea
[03:26] <ubuntutest> deear mrs. I have a HP Compaq DC 7600, USB optical mouse, keyboard ps2, whe ubuntu start the keyboard its freeze, I have to disconect the mose reebot log in to ubunut and later reconect the mouse
[03:26] <ubuntutest> can you help me???
[03:27] <crimsun> ubuntutest: is this under breezy or dapper?

[03:27] <Antoni0> hi all
[03:27] <Antoni0> somebody speak spanish?
[03:27] <crimsun> Antoni0: #ubuntu-es
[03:27] <open_shel1> Crimson. I have had similar issues with some USB devices in Dapper.
[03:27] <Antoni0> i need help :(
[03:27] <amphi> T`: perhaps parted can show such info? (guessing)
[03:28] <amphi> !es
[03:28] <ubotu> Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[03:28] <open_shel1> I had to go into the BIOS and change it so that it did not attempt to boot from the USB port before the HD or PIXIE
[03:28] <crimsun> open_shel1: granted, but since the only real fixes at this point can go into dapper, you're better off diagnosing against dapper
[03:30] <open_shel1> Absolutely, you are right crimsun.
[03:31] <ghostrunner> Im having problems dual booting win xp with my ubuntu desktop. I have the bios set to install from CDROM first, but is there a way to make sure ubuntu is not hogging the bootloader? I may want to try out other distros of linux too :)
[03:31] <T`> amphi, dont see anything there.. h m
[03:32] <ubuntutest> I didn't find nothing at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[03:33] <crimsun> ubuntutest: the info was sent to you in a private message.
[03:33] <torpedo|dog> hollywoodb, do you think you could give me a hand if I described my problem to you more detailed-ly?
[03:34] <calamari> every once in a while I see a program appear on the taskbar, called "Launching HTTP Cache Cleaner".. what is this?  Is it a virus?
[03:34] <Blue89> where is gnu assembler (gas) in synaptic? I searched it and it didn't show up
[03:35] <werthog> Can anybody help me with a problem with a wireless card? I just installed Ubuntu 5.10 on a laptop today, and I read that the correct drivers were included in this release (MadWifi). Ubuntu recognizes the wireless card and even connects to my wireless network, but the internet still doesn't seem to work...
[03:35] <ubuntutest> sorry crimsun
[03:36] <werthog> The wireless router is an Apple Airport connected by dialup modem, and every other computer I've tried has required no setup to connect through it
[03:38] <werthog> And if this isn't the right place to ask such a question, where should I go?
[03:38] <Blue89> nevermind, it's as, not gas
[03:40] <NickGarvey> what difference would I notice between a 32 bit installation and a 64 bit installation on a 64 bit system
[03:41] <NickGarvey> and would my integrated wireless card work on a 32 bit?
[03:41] <S3R61O> join #ubuntu-pt
[03:41] <NickGarvey> me?
[03:41] <NickGarvey> nope

[03:49] <anthony> hi, i'm trying to mount a harddrive, how ?
[03:49] <NickGarvey> anthony: fdisk -l
[03:49] <NickGarvey> look for the partition you want (/dev/hdc1 or something)
[03:49] <claudio> por acaso seria a pixview play tv mpeg2
[03:50] <anthony> nickgarvey: absolutely nothing happens when i type fdisk -l
[03:50] <NickGarvey> then mkdir /mnt/hd??, and mount /dev/hd?? /mnt/dev/hd?? where the ?? are whatever place it is
[03:50] <NickGarvey> anthony: sudo fdisk -l ;)
[03:50] <disinterested_pe> how do u save whats in terminal
[03:51] <werthog> Can anybody help me with a problem regarding a wireless card?
[03:51] <NickGarvey> werthog: lay it on me
[03:51] <NickGarvey> disinterested_pe: take a screen shot.. you could copy and paste.. world of possibilities!
[03:51] <anthony> ok, here is the error i get when i try to mount it - http://pastebin.com/734376
[03:51] <disinterested_pe> ty nickgarvey
[03:52] <NickGarvey>  anthony: show me what you typed
[03:52] <werthog> Okay, I just installed Breezy Badger on my old Thinkpad T40
[03:52] <facugaich> how can I stop a module from loading automatically?
[03:52] <GaiaX11> Where do I find a SystemRescueCD to download for ubuntu?
[03:52] <NickGarvey> anthony: although that looks like the harddrive failed
[03:52] <anthony> sudo mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt/mediahdd (mediahdd is the name i want the folder to be)
[03:52] <NickGarvey> which reminds me.. I have on in the freezer I want recovered
[03:52] <werthog> I read up on the compatability first, and it says that the required drivers for the wireless card are already installed, and that it should "just work"
[03:52] <NickGarvey> werthog: if only things were that easy ;) what kind of wireless card?
[03:53] <anthony> nickgarvey: i was reading / writing from the hd on a previous install, and reinstalled ubuntu (for other reasons), and it now fails
[03:53] <anthony> nickgarvey: would the easiest thing be to format the hd and then remount?
[03:53] <NickGarvey> anthony: have you formatted it sense?
[03:53] <anthony> no
[03:53] <werthog> I forget the name exactly, but it uses the MadWifi drivers
[03:53] <NickGarvey> anthony: I would, anything you NEED recovered off it though?
[03:53] <werthog> and Ubuntu does recognize it, and even connects to my wireless network
[03:53] <anthony> uh, well there are about 20 gigs of flac files :)
[03:53] <anthony> but i can go without them
[03:53] <NickGarvey> werthog: so whats the problem heh?
[03:53] <werthog> but nothing will load in firefox, and no pings work
[03:54] <werthog> so I can't get any internet, basically :/
[03:54] <ajcheema_> hey have any of u guys installed broadcom drivers using ndiswrapper???
[03:54] <werthog> I didn't think I needed any extra setup
[03:54] <NickGarvey> werthog: could you pastebin the following 2 commands, ipconfig, iwconfig
[03:54] <anthony> nickgarvey: what is the command to bring up that wonderful hdd formatter  ? like chfdisk or something
[03:54] <NickGarvey> anthony: cfdisk is pretty nice
[03:54] <anthony> that's it
[03:54] <NickGarvey> anthony: :)
[03:55] <anthony> ok, it's not listing hdb at all in cfdisk!
[03:55] <werthog> okay, I've run both of those
[03:55] <NickGarvey> anthony: ouchy
[03:55] <NickGarvey> anthony: lemme check it
[03:55] <werthog> I'm actually chatting on another laptop, since I can't get online any other way besides wirelessly on the ubuntu computer
[03:55] <NickGarvey> oh thats not cool
[03:55] <NickGarvey>                                  FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition 7: enlarged logical partitions overlap
[03:55] <VanacaErkan> Hey guys is there a way to restore deleted files (roleback) at the ubuntu-debian webserver? I think I removed (rm -R) a folder by mistake..
[03:55] <NickGarvey> werthog: pastebin em though
[03:55] <bluelotus> hey, how do you get ubuntu to keep the positions of all your windows and what is open etc... on reboot?
[03:55] <NickGarvey> werthog: although.. that might be hard..
[03:56] <NickGarvey> werthog: have a usb drive or such
[03:56] <werthog> yeah
[03:56] <werthog> want the output?
[03:56] <werthog> i'll get on that
[03:56] <NickGarvey> werthog: mount it, and then like iwconfig > /media/usbdisk/iwconfig.txt
[03:56] <anthony> nickgarvey: physically, the drive is connected just dandily.
[03:56] <torpedo|dog> I'm trying to get Sound Recorder to record something, but depending on what I have selected I get either silence or static with my voice interspersed.
[03:56] <Ian_S> Does anyone know how to contact Mark Shuttleworth? I have a personal question for him.
[03:56] <NickGarvey> anthony: fdisk -l sees it?
[03:56] <Ian_S> Doubt that he'd respond
[03:56] <anthony> yes
[03:56] <Ian_S> :)
[03:57] <NickGarvey> anthony: might need to use fdisk then
[03:57] <anthony> nickgarvey: yes
[03:57] <anthony> nickgarvey: alright, i want to format it to ext3
[03:57] <claudio> alguem ai do brasil
[03:57] <NickGarvey> anthony: I mean parted, use parted
[03:57] <ajcheema> Hi guys, sorry to disrupt your flow, but anybody here intsall a broadcom driver for a broadcom wireless card using ndiswrapper?
[03:58] <anthony> nickgarvey: sorry, i don't know what that means
[03:58] <claudio> alguem ai do brasil
[03:58] <NickGarvey> anthony: type parted and tell me what happens

[03:59] <anthony> nickgarvey: "using /dev/hda (parted)" ?
[03:59] <gnomefreak> NickGarvey: iirc they merge
[03:59] <NickGarvey> anthony: mm second
[03:59] <njal> is it possible NDISWrapper could freeze a computer if the kernel used 4K memory stacks?
[03:59] <NickGarvey> anthony: parted /dev/hdb
[04:00] <NickGarvey> ok maybe someone can answer my question
[04:00] <Allb969> hi to all
[04:00] <anthony> nickgarvey: "using /dev/hdb (parted)"
[04:00] <NickGarvey> what will happen if I use 32 bit linux on a 64 bit computer?  what will the differences be
[04:00] <NickGarvey> anthony: excellent, type p
[04:00] <NickGarvey> and hit entre
[04:00] <anthony> it says taht the fs is ntfs
[04:00] <anthony> but i last formatted it as ext3
[04:00] <Allb969> getting brezzy tonight
[04:00] <bluelotus> :-) Anyone know how to save window positions and workspace dedications on reboot / logout?
[04:01] <NickGarvey> anthony: okie type "rm 1", that will delete it
[04:01] <anthony> nickgarvey: it didn't give me any feedback after i typed that, but i did type it
[04:01] <h2os> anthonyclick system -> sessions
[04:01] <NickGarvey> anthony: now type p again
[04:02] <ikor> bluelotus: system->prefs->sessions
[04:02] <bb2> any insight on getting a good image to burn?
[04:02] <anthony> nickgarvey: empty
[04:02] <NickGarvey> anthony: perfect, "mkfs 1 ext3" will make ext3
[04:02] <NickGarvey> anthony: although the partition might not be there, but try that anyway
[04:02] <Allb969> is it possible to use breezy on a celeron?
[04:03] <anthony> nickgarvey: 'partition doesnt exist'
[04:03] <anthony> sure is
[04:03] <dli> Allb969, of course
[04:03] <bluelotus> Thanks!
[04:03] <amachu> hi, how to un install a package
[04:03] <amachu> in ubuntu
[04:04] <NickGarvey> anthony: mkpartfs logical ext3
[04:04] <NickGarvey> anthony: then hit enter for the defaults
[04:04] <anthony> what's the difference between primary/extended
[04:04] <anthony> it's just a slave drive
[04:05] <NickGarvey> anthony: you can have 4 primary partitions, so you need extended if you want more than 4 (like I have on my laptop, I have 7, so 3 are logical and 4 are extended)
[04:06] <anthony> nickgarvey: ok, i chose primary.  it then prompted me for the fs, i typed ext3, then it prompted, "start?", i typed yes
[04:06] <anthony> nickgarvey: now can i do mkfs 1 ext3  ?
[04:06] <anthony> nickgarvey: apparently not, the partition still doesn't exist
[04:06] <NickGarvey> anthony: heh, I think start means where should the partition start
[04:06] <disinterested_pe> does anyone know which version of debian i need for breezy
[04:07] <NickGarvey> anthony: so type 1
[04:07] <NickGarvey> and the end should be the end of the drive, whatever that is
[04:07] <anthony> end of the drive?
[04:07] <NickGarvey> anthony: yeah, whatever block that is
[04:07] <anthony> i don't understand :\
[04:08] <rapture_23> I've always used RH based linux distros (Mandrake/Mandriva, Fedora, etc...) and have just installed Ubuntu 5.10 on my laptop.  What are the essential differences between YUM and APT?
[04:08] <NickGarvey> anthony: just hit enter and see what happens I'd say
[04:08] <ray_> question: does the new driver nvidia released affect ubuntu users right now?
[04:09] <Eleaf> I dunno.
[04:09] <anthony> not noticeably
[04:09] <Eleaf> Have they released a package yet?
[04:09] <anthony> nickgarvey: it prompts me again
[04:09] <NickGarvey> blah
[04:09] <Eleaf> (package for the nvidia drivers)
[04:09] <NickGarvey> second
[04:10] <ray_> http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
[04:10] <bb2> i cant seem to get a good cd burned, any suggestions?
[04:10] <NoUse> rapture_23 I think apt-get is a better system but I suppose that is arguable, apt-get is def faster though
[04:10] <NickGarvey> anthony: give me a second, I'll reformat my swap
[04:10] <anthony> ooh what a maverick :)
[04:10] <NickGarvey> anthony: bah I didn't need to make the partition though..
[04:11] <NickGarvey> anthony: mm.. try cfdisk /dev/hdb
[04:11] <rapture_23> NoUse:  Thanks.  Do I use them basically the same (ie.  'apt update' to update all system software)?
[04:11] <NickGarvey> apt-get update!
[04:12] <amphi> NickGarvey: a noble cry!
[04:12] <rapture_23> NG:  Thanks.  I'll have to get used to the differences.
[04:12] <NoUse> rapture_23 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade to upgrade
[04:13] <MorbidHunger> what program should i use to burn a dvd?
[04:13] <rapture_23> nouse:  does apt-get upgrade upgrade me from major releases (ie.  5.10 to 6.06)?
[04:13] <mike930> can someone tell me how to change the "Main menu" icon on my pannel. Or is it not possible with schema?
[04:13] <anthony> nickgarvey: that worked, how do i set the fs to ext3?
[04:14] <jojoman02> ubuntu-ers, anyone know a cool program that turns your computer monitor into a strobe light
[04:14] <NickGarvey> anthony: it should have done that. check p again
[04:14] <anthony> wow that would blow your moniter out :)
[04:14] <NickGarvey> anthony: if not, type q, and then mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1
[04:14] <jojoman02> anyhony: yeah, perhaps that is my goal...
[04:14] <jojoman02> :D
[04:14] <jojoman02> anthony: i wouldn't mind getting a new lcd, i'm tired of crt
[04:15] <ray_> does anyone here know if the linux nvidia driver supports Geforce MX4000 64MB 32-bit DDR AGP 4X/8X Video Card?
[04:15] <ronlybonly> Has anybody here had success with the synthesizer ZynAddSubFX on ubuntu (specifically Dapper)?
[04:15] <NoUse> rapture_23 not by default
[04:15] <NoUse> !tell rapture_23 about upgrade
[04:15] <disinterested_pe> how do u find out which linux kernel is installed?
[04:15] <anthony> nickgarvey: there's nothing in p, let me try the latter command..
[04:15] <NickGarvey> anthony: bah then the partition wasn't made yet again
[04:16] <gighen> does anyone here know how I can install driver for Realtek BT880 sound?
[04:16] <disinterested_pe> or is it default the 2.6.12?
[04:16] <rapture_23> nouse:  that was a cool bot trick.
[04:16] <afireinside> Why is this the only channel that people are talking in..
[04:16] <NickGarvey> anthony: might just want to apt-get gparted
[04:16] <bb2> help burning cd from image??
[04:16] <NickGarvey> afireinside: because this is where the cool kids are
[04:17] <NickGarvey> !tell bb2 about gnomebaker
[04:17] <NoUse> !botsnack
[04:17] <ubotu> thanks nouse :)
[04:17] <NickGarvey> or not
[04:17] <anthony> nickgarvey: 'invalid operation gparted'
[04:17] <NickGarvey> !tell bb2 about iso
[04:17] <afireinside> Ok, I'll accept that
[04:17] <ray_> anyone here know which video cards are supported with the linux nvidia driver?
[04:17] <Yanlowen> Help I have the drivers for my Nvidia card. But when I try to run this command...(sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run) under run as a different user(root) nothing happens. anyone know if I am doing it wrong?
[04:17] <NickGarvey> anthony: heh, I ment "apt-get install gparted", I used apt-get like a verb
[04:17] <torpedo|dog> Is there a rational explanation for the fact that gedit is opening an older version of a file?
[04:17] <dsh> how do i configure my pcmcia card to start on bootup and nothing else
[04:17] <dsh> for internet
[04:17] <cubikdice> Yanlowen, you must run that while not in X
[04:18] <werthog> Had some problems with my irc client, i'm back
[04:18] <Jacob> hi all
[04:18] <mike930> can someone tell me how to change the "Main menu" icon on my pannel. Or is it not possible with schema?
[04:18] <anthony> nickgarvey: done
=== Jacob is now known as ``sh3l1
[04:18] <NoUse> Yanlowen have you tried the drivers from synatpic?
[04:18] <NickGarvey> anthony: run gparted
[04:18] <MorbidHunger> im going to marry wine
[04:18] <werthog> with my iwconfig and ifconfig :)
[04:18] <anthony> nickgarvey: doesn't display hdb
[04:18] <JB318> I'm interested in getting Ubuntu going on a laptop.  I currently use Gentoo on the desktop, and have used Debian in the past, but the Gentoo install on the laptop is nearly a year old, and I don't want to take the time to update everything or to reinstall Gentoo from scratch.
[04:18] <bb2> problem is I cant get a good burn, install fails at various points
[04:18] <jojoman02> FOUND IT: linux strobe light program here, http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Strobe-Light-4862.shtml
[04:19] <NickGarvey> werthog: oh yes, any luck?
[04:19] <jojoman02> for anyone that is interested
[04:19] <JB318> I'm downloading the install ISO right now... anything else I should know?
[04:19] <NickGarvey> anthony: gksudo gparted
[04:19] <Yanlowen> okay will try them thru synaptic if that doesn't work I will try those then get back to you all
[04:19] <NickGarvey> JB318: expect software to download much faster ;)
[04:19] <NoUse> NickGarvey it will probably download just as fast, it will just install faster :-)
[04:19] <anthony> nickgarvey: ok, what now?
[04:19] <JB318> What I'm wanting to do is make the laptop be my portable music player, so I need some sort of jukebox-style software (but I don't remember what's available)
[04:19] <werthog> according to that output, it looks as though the wireless card IS connected to the network
[04:19] <NickGarvey> NoUse: hah true
[04:20] <VitaminG> ray: the official drivers have a listing on the download page as to which cards are supported. the generic drivers pretty much cover anything newer than tnt2
[04:20] <NickGarvey> JB318: vlc.. mplayer.. totem... amarok..
[04:20] <anthony> amarok ftw!
[04:20] <werthog> is there anything I should be looking for specifically?
[04:20] <NickGarvey> JB318: although theres a distro for it.. whats it called... geex-box or something
[04:20] <JB318> Yeah, I don't know offhand if Gentoo has precompiled X binaries... speed is definitely the name of the game here :)
[04:20] <MorbidHunger> whats a good program to copy a dvd?
[04:20] <NickGarvey> werthog: missing IP addresses, or no MAC address
[04:20] <drake> if there is only one person logged into why would it show the same username logged in twice to one box?
[04:21] <NickGarvey> anthony: work?
[04:21] <Allb969> cheers to all
[04:21] <anthony> nickgarvey: no
[04:21] <anthony> nickgarvey: a little app showed up that makes no mention of hdb
[04:21] <afireinside> MorbidHunger: I was recommended DVD Decrypter
[04:21] <NickGarvey> anthony: gksudo didn't?
[04:21] <NickGarvey> anthony: oh good it should have showed up
[04:21] <NickGarvey> anthony: now let me try to remeber what the gui looks like heh
[04:22] <MorbidHunger> for linux?
[04:22] <MorbidHunger> or should i use wine with the w32 version?
[04:22] <JB318> I need something like Gnome Music Player... something with good playlist support
[04:22] <werthog> seems all right, even shows the MAC address of the access point and all of the connection statistics (bit rate, signal level, etc.)
[04:22] <NickGarvey> MorbidHunger: sec
[04:22] <NickGarvey> JB318: amarok then
[04:22] <amphi> drake: type 'w' in a term
[04:22] <NickGarvey> MorbidHunger: http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/
[04:22] <D1> have you guys seen bonfire (new burning app)?
[04:22] <JB318> NickGarvey: Isn't that KDE?
[04:22] <D1> it looks amazing
[04:22] <werthog> i'm using a wireless router with a built-in dialup modem, if that helps...
[04:22] <NickGarvey> JB318: so?
[04:22] <ray_> vitaming: thanks, i'd missed the link on the left side earlier
[04:22] <D1> a straight competitor to k3b with time...
[04:23] <JB318> NickGarvey: I'm not downloading Kubuntu
[04:23] <MorbidHunger> thanx mate
[04:23] <ray_> that clears that up nicely
[04:23] <NickGarvey> JB318: doesn't mean it won't work..
[04:23] <amphi> werthog: you're using wifi behind dial up?? that's a new one ;)
[04:23] <NickGarvey> JB318: don't want to download anything new?
[04:23] <werthog> it's all I can get where I live :/
[04:23] <NickGarvey> JB318: then.. I think totem
[04:23] <JB318> I didn't think KDE stuff was supported on Ubuntu proper, that you had to use Kubuntu
[04:23] <werthog> ironic, i know
[04:23] <NickGarvey> werthog: odd...
[04:23] <NickGarvey> werthog: can other computers see yours?
[04:23] <drake> amphi: there is one logged in to TTY :0 and one to pts/0
[04:23] <NickGarvey> werthog: oh wait.. I had this problem.. which is why I am on suse now..
[04:24] <anthony> jb318: if i go into synaptic and select a kde app, say amarok, it pulls up all the dependencies and the program runs fine
[04:24] <VitaminG> ray: good luck with the install
[04:24] <Ademan> when i try and shut down ubuntu on my laptop, instead of seeing all of the proccesses shut down ("Sengding SIGKILL ..." and all that) the screen just blanks, and it hangs like that (for all eternity) and I have to hard power down.  And i assume taht its really NOT ready to be hard powered down
[04:24] <werthog> oh, great :P
[04:24] <JB318> OK, that makes sense from my Debian years...
[04:24] <NickGarvey> werthog: I didn't try much though
[04:24] <werthog> well i've only been using ubuntu for about a day, so i'm not so attached to this distro anyway
[04:24] <NickGarvey> werthog: well I'd say keep trying
[04:24] <werthog> ok, I'll keep looking around
[04:24] <JB318> So then why does Kubuntu exist?
[04:25] <amphi> werthog: what's the problem?
[04:25] <NickGarvey> werthog: knetworkmanager is very nice
[04:25] <VitaminG> ademan: that happens on my desktop once in a while too. hard shut down has never caused any problems
[04:25] <NickGarvey> JB318: so you don't get the gnome bloat
[04:25] <NickGarvey> JB318: when you instnall
[04:25] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work?
[04:25] <werthog> knetworkmanager?
[04:25] <NickGarvey> werthog: yeah I use that on suse
[04:25] <NickGarvey> nice stuff
[04:25] <anthony> nickgarvey: maybe windows is the best os for me, this is rediculous =(
[04:25] <NickGarvey> anthony: (slap)
[04:25] <werthog> ok, I'll look into that
[04:26] <NickGarvey> anthony: have windows on dual boot?
[04:26] <anthony> had
[04:26] <Xbox_guru> hello, when I click on the volume control Ubuntu tells me this, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14565
[04:26] <Ademan> VitaminG: well, its EVERY TIME, and i feel really uneasy about it, you dont happen to ahve any clue what causes this, or preferably, how to fix it haha
[04:26] <MorbidHunger> dvdrip doesnt like me
[04:26] <NickGarvey> anthony: good
[04:26] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work?
[04:26] <drake> I tried to log into this box remoted the other day and wouldn't accept any connection and today when I logged onto it locally there was only the loopback showing for the net connection and I couldn't get it back up with ifconfig up and restart networking but worked fine after I rebooted....what could have caused that?
[04:26] <Xbox_guru> what do I do
[04:26] <NickGarvey> anthony: personally, I use the gparted cd for all my partitioning needs
[04:26] <anthony> nickgarvey: well, i've been playing a certain game for almost 6 years, and i'm a week's worth of withdrawl right now
[04:26] <NickGarvey> anthony: heh what game
[04:26] <werthog> i'm probably going to just burn a few liveCDs at school and try out some different distros until I find one I like... this isn't really urgent anyway
[04:26] <anthony> nickgarvey: it's supposed to work under wine, but it's fscking me in the butt.
[04:26] <werthog> see you later
[04:26] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work?
=== waky|off is now known as waky
[04:27] <NickGarvey> werthog: have fun
[04:27] <anthony> nickgarvey: subspace/continuum
[04:27] <amphi> MorbidHunger: acidrip is ok for ripping dvds, if you don't like raw mencoder
[04:27] <NickGarvey> anthony: whats not working? cedega is good for games
[04:27] <MorbidHunger> i jsut want to burn it
[04:27] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work using breezy badger?
[04:27] <VitaminG> ademan: im not sure what's causing it on linux, but I know windoze does that on some machines if you leave programs open as you shut down. maybe that could be causing problems. thats my only guess
[04:27] <``sh3l1> tahorg: i swiched to SuSE, and i am going to swich back, it is 2gb and it doesn't even have support for my video card. I still cant get ubuntu running with ndiswrapper. As of now, i do not need the SSH thing, but i was wondering if you had time sometime this weekend?
[04:27] <anthony> nickgarvey: well my latest problem (in my previous install of ubuntu, i had the game installed but it wouldn't start), is applying a patch
[04:27] <NickGarvey> anthony: eh I don't know much about games
[04:27] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work using breezy badger?
[04:28] <anthony> nickgarvey: ubuntu likes to throw random errors at me that don't seem to follow a pattern
[04:28] <amphi> MorbidHunger: no dvd writer here, so no idea I'm afraid - ask apt-cache perhaps
[04:28] <NickGarvey> seb_: I'm sure you could find it with google..
[04:28] <seb_> does anybody know how to make the airport extreme on a powerbook g4 work using breezy badger?
[04:28] <MorbidHunger> guess ill nero it
[04:28] <drake> amphi: why is there two of the same usernames logged in under different TTY even though I am only logged in locally?
[04:28] <Ademan> could X be shutting down without having a replacement or something?
[04:28] <sflash> im having problems writing to a directory. In my file browser it shows the locked symbol. what  does this mean and how do i get rid of it?
[04:28] <amphi> seb_: please don't repeat
[04:29] <amphi> drake: dunno - do you have a term open?
[04:29] <anthony> nickgarvey: well, thansk for your help.  i think i'll reinstall once more, and maybe my luck will change.
[04:29] <torpedo|dog> sflash, it means that you can't write to a directory. Is this directory inside your home?
[04:29] <MorbidHunger> u think nero would work with cross over or wine?
[04:29] <NickGarvey> anthony: I doubt thats needed...
[04:29] <NickGarvey> anthony: if you have a blank I highly suggest a gparted cd
[04:29] <anthony> nickgarvey: i get different results with everything per each install.
[04:29] <drake> yup I opened a term to see what was going on that my connection dropped
[04:29] <NickGarvey> anthony: a business card size will do it
[04:29] <NickGarvey> anthony: well good luck
[04:29] <``sh3l1> tahorg: are you there?!
[04:30] <amphi> drake: that's the second one, I expect
[04:30] <drake> drake    :0       -                22:17   ?xdm?  32.39s  0.43s x-session-manag
[04:30] <amphi> drake: that's your gui login
[04:30] <sflash> it is inside my home
[04:30] <drake> drake    pts/0    :0.0             22:17    0.00s  0.01s  0.00s w
[04:30] <Rhine> How do i change to a disk from read only to writeable?
[04:30] <amphi> drake: that's the xterm
[04:30] <torpedo|dog> sflash, okay, you just need to right-click it and select 'properties'
[04:30] <NickGarvey> Rhine: is it ntfs?
[04:30] <VitaminG> ademan: you could check if that's the problem by using control-alt-backspace. if the computer freezes, then bash or one of its dependencies coul;d be broken. if it works fine when you do that, then there shouldn't be a problem with X quitting.
[04:30] <sflash> torpedo|dog: I have insinde my home/username directory. Its a USB drive that i mounted there
[04:30] <Rhine> no
[04:30] <Rhine> extended 2
[04:30] <drake> amphi: oh ok
[04:31] <torpedo|dog> sflash, I see.
[04:31] <sflash> torpedo|dog: ok i clicked on it. owner is root and group is root
[04:31] <``sh3l1> tahorg: when  you get back from whereever you are, this is jacob_ rykunzta or deadlycow one of the three xD
[04:31] <sflash> torpedo|dog: all properties are disabled i cant edit them
[04:31] <Rhine> when i type this in i get this back chmod: changing permissions of `/media/hda1': Read-only file system
[04:31] <drake> amphi: where is the best place to check to see what caused the eth0 to die and not be restarted by ifconfig down and then up and  /etc/init.d/networking restart?
[04:32] <torpedo|dog> sflash, I don't know what you'd do then because I'm not too sure about editing permissions on mounted media.
[04:32] <torpedo|dog> Make sure it isn't write-protected ;)
[04:32] <Ademan> well bash works normally, but thats not what you mean huh
[04:32] <Ademan> i
[04:32] <sflash> its not.
[04:32] <Ademan> i'll give it a shot
[04:32] <VitaminG> ademan: but if bash is broken, you might have to use the CD to repair it.
[04:32] <sflash> i think it has a something to do with the fstab file
[04:32] <sflash> and the settings there
[04:33] <JB318> I started downloading the Kubuntu ISO instead.
[04:33] <sflash> but not sure what
[04:33] <VitaminG> ademan: you've got a strange situation on your hands
[04:33] <NickGarvey> JB318: :)
[04:33] <JB318> I'm liking amaroK based on the screenshots... There's a "party mode" that, whatever it is, has to be cool :)
[04:33] <Ademan> VitaminG: well its a laptop, and laptops are rediculous with linux lol
[04:33] <VitaminG> true
[04:33] <Ademan> afaik ubuntu has the best laptop support out there thus far
[04:33] <sflash> but i dont know what
[04:34] <NickGarvey> Ademan: which is why I am desperately waiting for dapper
[04:34] <JB318> Though the comments on the screenshot say the feature was never implemented
[04:34] <Ademan> and that withstanding, I had to use the dapper beta for it to work :-)
[04:34] <drake> anyone have a suggestion of where to start looking for that problem?
[04:34] <NickGarvey> Ademan: its going to take over gentoo and suse ;)
[04:34] <Ademan> NickGarvey: hehe, i'm using the dapper beta, its the ONLY linux distro out of 3 i've tried that will work on my laptop
[04:34] <Ademan> well, not to say with a LOT of workarounds and whatnot the other 3 couldnt have done it
[04:35] <VitaminG> I don't think any OS really has laptop support down 100%, though
[04:35] <VitaminG> even windoze
[04:35] <sflash> anyone know how to give rights to USB drive?
[04:35] <Ademan> but considering they couldnt even BOOT, (without me going into single user mode) which i messed around with for a while, it was just too much of a hassle for me, especially since i'm still a linux newbie
[04:35] <NickGarvey> Ademan: wireless didn't work though.. I'll play with it more
[04:35] <Ademan> NickGarvey: heh, mine does under dapper
[04:36] <NickGarvey> I used an early alpha though
[04:36] <nickrud> drake, have you tried ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0, those scripts are pretty smart
[04:36] <kekn> 
[04:36] <Rhine> how do i fix this error i know for a fact that i have edited the drive before? chmod: changing permissions of `/media/hda1': Read-only file system
[04:36] <nickrud> !tz
[04:36] <ubotu> nickrud: I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:37] <NoUse> Rhine ntfs?
[04:37] <Rhine> No its ext3
[04:37] <VitaminG> i haven't tried dapper yet, but I have a dialup connection, So i can't just download CDs at random
[04:37] <kekn> hello !everyone
[04:37] <Yanlowen> how should I run this command? sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run
[04:37] <drake> nickrud: no I didn't try that, I was trying to figure out what had made it go down in the first place but wasn't sure where to look and I tried to restart the services and that didn't work so I rebooted and it worked
[04:37] <NoUse> Rhine check the output of 'mount' and see if its mounted ro
[04:37] <JB318> I'm going to be ripping at least a handful of audio CDs during this process.  I can do that on my desktop and netcat the files over but is there something good in Kubuntu that I should consider instead?
[04:38] <reconcilliation> is acpid just for laptops
[04:38] <nickrud> drake, troubleshooting only works when the problem exists :)
[04:38] <Eleaf> acid?

[04:39] <kekn> hi
[04:39] <drake> nickrud: lol well I figured that there is some log file somewhere that would say what made the eth0 crap out
[04:39] <NickGarvey> my /boot is on an extended partition which I want to remove, can I just cp -r /boot /mnt/hda2 assuming hda2 is where I want /boot to be?
[04:39] <nickrud> kekn, you need some help?
[04:39] <kekn> yes
[04:39] <NickGarvey> and then install the bootloader of course
[04:39] <nickrud> well, chinese, we can't read :)
[04:39] <torpedo|dog> kekn, try checking the Japanese or Chinese or Korean channels (I'm unfortunately unable to tell which script it is)
[04:39] <amphi> NickGarvey: cp -a is good
[04:39] <Madpilot> !cz

[04:40] <nickrud> kekn, seattle
[04:40] <NickGarvey> amphi: archive.. whats that mean
[04:40] <nickrud> living in houston

[04:40] <lufis> How can I make animated gifs on linux?
[04:40] <NickGarvey> amphi: oh! wish I knew that a few days ago..
[04:40] <amphi> NickGarvey: and date stamps IIRC, but that's not significant in this case
[04:41] <amphi> NickGarvey: cp -a is most useful ;)
[04:41] <kekn> my english is bad
[04:41] <NickGarvey> amphi: thank you very much
[04:41] <amphi> NickGarvey: yw
[04:41] <torpedo|dog> lufis, if you make an image in GIMP with multiple layers and export it as a GIF, you can set it up to either export it as a single layered image or an animation.
[04:41] <nickrud> kekn, maybe try joining #ubuntu-cn ?
[04:41] <Yanlowen> Okay nvidia says to type the command to run the installer for my video drivers....sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run.... but where do I type it? it doean't work in bash, tells me i need to be root, won't work under run as a different user(as root). nothing happens when I do that.
[04:41] <lufis> Torpedo, great, thanks :)
[04:41] <reconcilliation> lufis you can use a popular image manip program like gimp
[04:41] <kekn> i think so
[04:41] <nickrud> kekn, be well

[04:56] <Junichi> nickrud: I *dont* want to burn a CD.

[04:57] <Junichi> ...
[04:58] <amphi> Ratzilla: /etc/network/interfaces - see man 5 interfaces and man 7 wireless, and man iwconfig perhaps

[05:03] <kekn> thank you nickrud
[05:03] <tangent> My gnome-control-center is broken (various managers return errors when I try to run them) and input device settings are borked. I've tried reinstalling gnome-control-center with no effect. Can anyone offer suggestions how to proceed?
[05:03] <nickrud> kekn, there is a lot of agitated talk about myspell and startdict for openoffice going on right now.
[05:04] <lufis> I'm trying to create a simple animated gif in ubuntu. Someone mentioned using the gimp but i'm having trouble doing that. I installed gifisicle and it doesn't work. Any alternative ideas?
[05:04] <nickrud> I think myspell is going to win
[05:04] <sakka> stpere: in media all i see is cdrom and cdrom0, they both have the same data
[05:04] <amphi> lufis: gifsicle used to work fine
[05:04] <lufis> Amphi: I understand, but I run it and nothing happens
[05:04] <nickrud> lufis, ask on #gimp, they know a heck of a lot more
[05:04] <amphi> sakka: cdrom is a symlink to cdrom0
[05:04] <lufis> Nickrud: alright, thank you
[05:04] <kekn> thank you
[05:04] <ReWT_AxS> any of you good with kismet on breezy?
[05:04] <VitaminG> lufis: do you have gimp's animation package?
[05:05] <stpere> sakka, what kind of media player is it?
[05:05] <hosler> !win32codecs
[05:05] <ubotu> win32codecs is probably binary only codecs that some call evil., and they're available from http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl/
[05:05] <lufis> VitaminG: I wasn't aware there was one. Maybe that's my problem?
[05:05] <sakka> stpere: gotcha... it is an creative nomad zen
[05:05] <hosler> What is some fun stuff to do with a dedicated server?
[05:06] <lufis> Hosler: SSH ;)
[05:06] <sakka> stpere: i can use gnomad2 to see the data, but i want to use a player on my linux system to listen to it
[05:06] <rendo> How do I add programs to the menu listings? IE Application->Games, etc etc?
[05:06] <hosler> sakka: you watch avatar?
[05:06] <VitaminG> rendo: smeg
[05:06] <sakka> stpere: not sure where i look to show the player on linux to play the music...
[05:07] <VitaminG> rendo: for gnome
[05:07] <sakka> hosler: no sir, never heard of it
[05:07] <Yanlowen> Help please tried to run a file from the root dir. it allowed me to type in home/james/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run. but when I run it I get a permission denied. Again I am running it from the Directory of root.
[05:07] <hosler> ok
[05:07] <hosler> anyone know where i can get the win32codecs. the link i got from here doesnt work.
[05:07] <sakka> hosler: why do you ask?
[05:07] <stpere> sakka, as I understand it, gnomad2 is using a special library to access your player
[05:07] <rendo> Awesome, thanks,.
[05:07] <nickrud> Yanlowen, you need to type that as sudo <command>
[05:08] <stpere> sakka, which would have to be used in rythmbox / whatever other player you are using
[05:08] <hosler> sakka: sakka is a character name
[05:08] <stpere> sakka, let me look for a driver
[05:08] <rendo> Hosler: Go use automatix or easyubuntu.
[05:08] <nickrud> Yanlowen, having root permission, not root location
[05:08] <hosler> rendo: i dont like those
[05:08] <torpedo|dog> hosler, I recommend easyubuntu
[05:08] <torpedo|dog> !easyubuntu
[05:08] <ubotu> hmm... easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
[05:08] <rendo> Hosler: They work though, I used easyubuntu and it worked fine for them.
[05:08] <sakka> stpere: i also have neutrino
[05:09] <Yanlowen> nickrud: so as home/james/sudo command or as sudo /home/james/ command?
[05:09] <nickrud> Yanlowen,  sudo /home/james/ command
[05:09] <sakka> hosler: really? Sakka is the buddhist king of the gods.... seems kinda of wierd for a tv show.........or I guess a screen name for that matter
[05:09] <Yanlowen> nickrud: thatnk you will try that right now
[05:10] <nickrud> Yanlowen, more accurately,  sudo /home/james/command <-- no space
[05:10] <stpere> sakka, sorry.. I don't know much about this kind of player.  All mine are recognized as standard USB mass storage
[05:11] <hosler> can someone link me to win32codecs package?
[05:11] <HymnToLife> !w32codecs
[05:11] <nickrud> !w32codecs
[05:11] <HymnToLife> why did the stupid bot /msg me ?
[05:11] <nickrud> HymnToLife, got an ubotu window open :)
=== khisanth_ is now known as Khisanth
[05:12] <sakka> stpere: np but thank you very much. If i had a usb mass storage, where would i find it in Linux? /media ?
[05:12] <HymnToLife> !tell hosler about w32codecs

[05:24] <crimsun> goffa_: no, don't try to recompile the ipw2200 driver.
[05:24] <crimsun> goffa_: --reinstall install  reinstalls the entire kernel image + modules, so you should be able to just ``sudo depmod -e && sudo modprobe ipw2200''
[05:24] <trelayne> all, I'm a Mandravifile for years, and I want to know what I hope to gain by moving to Ubuntu

[05:27] <trelayne> ReWT_AxS, I read your article on Dell installation of Ubuntu
[05:27] <KyoLptp`> or when listening to an mp3
[05:27] <nickrud> trelayne, oh, look at synaptic for the gui goodness. then there's apt-cache, and aptitude, and apt-get, and dpkg -L and -l and I could go on for hours

[05:30] <joe__> Can I play .m4a files with xmms?
[05:30] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: unmute the element you're attempting to record, and make sure it's selected for recording in alsamixer
[05:30] <torpedo|dog> See, the thing is, if I unmute the playback of the microphone, it gives me the lovely feedback noise that tells me both the microphone and speaker are working.
[05:30] <crimsun> joe__: if you install a plugin, xmms-mp4
[05:30] <goffa_> crimsun: i put it up there

[05:31] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: F4
[05:31] <torpedo|dog> Tack
[05:31] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: pastebin the output

[05:32] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, okay, I see nothing...
[05:32] <rendo> With Easyubuntu, is it best to use the nightly snapshot, bleeding edge, or the betarelease?
[05:32] <KyoLptp`> http://pastebin.com/734466
[05:32] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: you started alsamixer and pressed F4, correct?
[05:32] <torpedo|dog> I did.
[05:32] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: pastebin a screenshot
[05:32] <torpedo|dog> There's no "adjustment bar" on anything except "capture"
[05:32] <tobmoox> hi, im getting ready to install ubuntu on my laptop.  i used to use slack.  my laptop has an athareos wireless card(d-link) and with slack I needed to download madwifi drivers.  Also with slack, I needed to configure the kernel for alsa support and acpi support.  what will i probably need to do when installing ubuntu to work around these problems?
[05:32] <torpedo|dog> Well, lemme twiddle with that.
[05:32] <trelayne> question, what is hot about installing reiserfs versus any other format?
[05:32] <p47_> can somebody helps me !
[05:32] <Sivik> how do i open a dvd in mplayer
[05:33] <goffa_> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14568
[05:33] <Dr_Willis> trelayne,  id stick with ext3 - unless you got special needs and know the others would help you.
[05:33] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: that's easy. bittornado is hogging the oss emulation device /dev/dsp, which is exclusive. If an app opens /dev/dsp, no other app can if your hardware doesn't natively support pcm multiplexing.
[05:33] <trelayne> I know that ext3 has good recovery.. does reiser have better speed?
[05:33] <nickrud> tobmoox, I'd search http://wiki.ubuntu.com for atheros, it is supported I think
[05:33] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: so close bittornado.
[05:33] <tobmoox> k
[05:34] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, http://thetorpedodog.ath.cx:3242/~thetorpedodog/alsa
[05:34] <tobmoox> what about for alsa and acpi?
[05:34] <KyoLptp`> :(
[05:34] <nickrud> tobmoox, the other issues might be addressed
[05:34] <tobmoox> k
[05:34] <KyoLptp`> but, but, why does youtube still work?
[05:34] <torpedo|dog> I have aumix installed if that helps...
[05:34] <trelayne> I know that ReWT_AxS used ReiserFS
[05:34] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: what device does youtube use?
[05:34] <hexidigital_> trelayne: reiser claims to be faster, but i found on my server it was significantly slower than ext3
[05:35] <tobmoox> if i run into any problems i'll ask in this channel tonight.  maybe itll be less busy and more people can help me.
[05:35] <KyoLptp`> I dunno
[05:35] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: you need to use pastebin, because that site is blocked for me
[05:35] <dli> hexidigital_, I avoid reiserfs, but I use reiser4
[05:35] <KyoLptp`> but I had a video I loaded before I started bit tornado
[05:35] <Dr_Willis> trelayne,  all the benchmarks ive seen always seem to go the route of "this fs is better in this ONE case...  while the otherss are better in the othe rcase..." - and ext3 just seems to be solid :P and at times better in some benchmarks.
[05:35] <KyoLptp`> and it had sound after
[05:35] <KyoLptp`> then I closed that tab, opened a different youtube video
[05:35] <KyoLptp`> no sound.
[05:35] <trelayne> Dr_Willis,  ok sold.. I'm sticking to ext3
[05:35] <ReWT_AxS> hehe
[05:36] <MorbidHunger> didnt see anything about pnp
[05:36] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, try http://216.68.198.227:3242/~thetorpedodog/alsa
[05:36] <Dr_Willis> trelayne,  i think thats for the best.
[05:36] <KyoLptp`> and of course, the torrent slows to 4 kb/sec at 95%
[05:36] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: it's the port that matters.
[05:37] <trelayne> what about disk speed on a laptop running ubuntu? I want to get a recent model but want to know what minimum speed won't make a different with like 1 Gig memory
[05:37] <goffa_> crimsun: did you see my last paste of lsmod?
[05:37] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: so close bittornado and restart youtube or whatever.
[05:37] <crimsun> goffa_: I'm a bit busy if you can't tell...
[05:37] <goffa_> yeah.. i see that
[05:38] <MorbidHunger> anyone care to help me?
[05:38] <torpedo|dog> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14569
[05:38] <dewitt> how many here don't see the list.
[05:38] <crimsun> goffa_: yeah, I see it. Pastebin ``modinfo ieee80211 ipw2200''
[05:38] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: sec
[05:39] <rendo> I'm assuming the reason a lot of software isn't installed on Ubuntu is to prevent bloat?  Like I mean, why a lot of codecs aren't in, and media players (besides the whole illegal in US business).  Is that the main reason why?
[05:39] <Madpilot> dewitt, which list?
[05:39] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: did you scroll left and/or right using the arrow keys?
[05:39] <dewitt> ? is it normal for ubuntu to be slowing then dial up useing dsl.
[05:39] <Madpilot> rendo, codecs aren't in purely because of legal issues
[05:39] <MorbidHunger> hey crimsun i didnt see anything about pnp
[05:39] <dewitt> i was here last nite for the first time, and i saw the names of people in chat don't see it now
=== TecnoVM64 is now known as stizoned
[05:39] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, if I scroll right all I get is "mix mono" which is the same blank as everything else
[05:40] <rendo> Madpilot: I'm just curious is all.  You'd think they'd want to make it as easy as possible for people to switch and not have to hassle figuring things out, especially if they're new/newer to linux.
[05:40] <trelayne> seems like there are problems with the Graphics drivers on the 17 inch laptops too
[05:40] <goffa_> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14570
[05:40] <Madpilot> rendo, yeah, but with the codecs, the legal situation is FUBARed, not much Ubuntu can do about it
[05:40] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: ok, pastebin ``amixer''
[05:41] <nickrud> rendo, I'd point you at the top of http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats to start, then the debian-legal iist
[05:41] <crimsun> goffa_: um, you ``--reinstall install''ed, correct?
=== amphi_ is now known as amphi
[05:42] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14571
[05:42] <nickrud> rendo, erm, don't go to debian-legal. That would be masochistic
[05:42] <rendo> I wasn't going to. :P
[05:42] <goffa_> crimsun: yeah .. i did: sudo apt-get --reinstal install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[05:42] <trelayne> ReWT_AxS,  by the way write to disc (on an iso) using gnautilus works very niceley thank you
[05:42] <goffa_> that the right command?
[05:42] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: Capture is muted and set to 0%.
[05:43] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: amixer set 'Capture' on && amixer set 'Capture' 90%
[05:43] <torpedo|dog> I think I might have done that graphically using Volume Control
[05:43] <torpedo|dog> seeing as I'm typing and the record monitor is going crazy.
[05:43] <rendo> I wonder if it's possible for a player to be able to play a restrictedformat by converting it in real time to a freeformat.....
[05:43] <torpedo|dog> Lessee
[05:44] <torpedo|dog> Okay, I get lots and lots of static and then also my voice.
[05:44] <nickrud> rendo, the conversion thingo would be resricted, no games :)
[05:44] <crimsun> goffa_: no, not -headers-
[05:44] <crimsun> goffa_: -image-
[05:44] <rendo> Damnit all to hell :P
[05:44] <rendo> I thought I was being clever.
[05:45] <nickrud> I've read debian-legal, clever is useless
[05:45] <tobmoox> i just got an error in my installation and need help.  if anyone would like to help please pm me.  thanks.
[05:45] <goffa_> oh... ok

[05:48] <rendo> Say for example I install restricted formats, and everytime I try and open a streaming video in that format my browser crashes, any idea what could be causing this?
[05:48] <tobmoox> nickrud: can i pm you?  i dont want to interfere with other peoples' questions
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> Hmm.. isent there a shell command tht can 'time' how long a command takes to run?  trying to time how long a 1gb file copy takes.
[05:48] <ReWT_AxS> no prob on the disc write
[05:48] <nickrud> tobmoox, no, it's better here to vet my possible answers
[05:48] <crimsun> Dr_Willis: time
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> silly me - its 'time' :P how... obvious.

[05:50] <Dr_Willis> nickrud,  im seeming to have some VERY VERY slow copies over samba. not sure where the issue is. so doing some testing.
[05:50] <tobmoox> i just told you
[05:50] <tecne21> sure
[05:51] <tobmoox> it keeps giving me a debootstrap error
[05:51] <tobmoox> im at this part called "Installing the base system"
[05:51] <foogle> I got a Kernel panic my install cd wont work anymore  I think it has some thing to do with segmentation
[05:51] <nickrud> tobmoox, seriously? If that's true, I'd first: capture, however I can, exactly what error messages I was getting, even on paper
[05:51] <Dr_Willis> nickrud,  now if i just knew what the times of 'real/user/system' ment. :P
[05:51] <rendo> Brb.
[05:52] <jackson> is it possible (generally speaking) for two separate linux distros to use the same /home if the distros and /home are all on separate partitions?
[05:52] <crimsun> KyoLptp`: what's the status?
[05:52] <amphi> Dr_Willis: wallclock, cpu time in userland, cpu time in kernel, I believe
[05:52] <tobmoox> nickrud: would you like me to pm you a copy of the exact error messages and how i installed exactly?
[05:52] <crimsun> jackson: yes, but be careful with differing major versions of software
[05:52] <nickrud> then, I'd post all that stuff to a pastebin, like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and point us at it
[05:52] <Managu_away> jackson: yes.  There's a gotcha with user IDs, too
[05:53] <nickrud> tobmoox, this collaborative work, not private.
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> amphi,  heh..   yea. so lets see 193M in 43 sec
[05:53] <jackson> Managu_away: couldn't I fix that with a symlink?
[05:53] <egad> no one? :c/
[05:53] <tobmoox> im repartitioning now to see if that makes a difference
=== Managu_away is now known as Managu
[05:53] <tobmoox> even though i did thatstep earlier
[05:53] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, still no...now it's controlling the volume of the amazingly loud static.
[05:54] <Managu> jackson: errm, I don't see how a symlink would help with what I'm thinking
[05:54] <amphi> egad: what makes you think they aren't 'detected'?
[05:54] <jackson> Managu: oh.. I probably misunderstood you. what were you thinking?
[05:54] <tobmoox> id hate to have this not install because then id have to redownload the old slack versions i had on there before
[05:54] <tobmoox> and that takes forever X(
[05:54] <tobmoox> now starting step "Installing the Base System"
[05:55] <amphi> egad: does ifconfig -a show the interfaces?
[05:55] <Managu> jackson: if you have a filesystem that's going to be tracked under 2 different OS's, those OS's might give the same "user" different UIDs.  But UIDs are just numbers that are stored along with the file
[05:55] <poimen> someone was using  XGL on dapper with this two sources in the sources.list?

[05:55] <rendo> GAH.
[05:55] <tobmoox> so i now got the error.  writing it into pastebin for yall.
[05:56] <rendo> Can anyone tell me why my browser crashes when I try and play a .wmv file, I just installed the codecs too.
[05:56] <nickrud> poimen, you can't ask questions on this channel about dapper untli the first :)
[05:56] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: what did you adjust?
[05:56] <jackson> Managu: will that create incompatabilities or just a (very) slightly larger /home?
[05:56] <poimen> ok sorry :P
[05:56] <torpedo|dog> I adjusted both "Microphone" and "Capture" quite a bit down.
[05:56] <foogle> I got a Kernel panic my install cd wont work anymore  I think it has some thing to do with segmentation
[05:57] <tobmoox> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14572
[05:57] <torpedo|dog> It's not distortion, it's just as if the data were randomly distorted, crimsun.
[05:57] <egad> what does the ubuntu install do when trying to detect network devices.. what commands is it running behind the scenes?
[05:57] <tobmoox> theres the paste of it
[05:57] <amphi> jackson: you could always adjust the uid on the second os before ever mounting the shared /home
[05:57] <nickrud> poimen, /j #ubuntu+1
[05:57] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: what if you use ``arecord -Dplughw:0 -fcd foo.wav'' ?
[05:57] <tobmoox> anyone know what thats about?
[05:58] <jackson> amphi: ah.. thank you.
[05:58] <IcemanV9> what are options of dpkg/aptitude to force install a package? it kept saying that my laptop did not meet swap space requirement. how do i bypass its requirement?
[05:58] <amphi> jackson: or don't create a normal user at all while installing the second os, and manually create a user with the desired uid
[05:58] <leojstewart> I'm trying to mount my windows partition, but there's no file name hda1 in /dev... can somebody please tell me what it might be?
[05:58] <tobmoox> i had slack on there before and just now put the install disc for ubuntu in, and started installing, and got that error
[05:58] <nickrud> IcemanV9, that's an odd error. What's the context?
[05:58] <trelayne> on kernels: I remember that when I attempted to compile one to make my sound card work like 9 years ago, I had lost support for some devices that WERE working. ANyone know how I can see what devices I do have (and any hw settings)  so that I don't accidentally remove support for something obscure?
[05:58] <rendo> !w32codecs
[05:59] <amphi> jackson: you can still have the problem of programs on each distro clobbering the other's dotfiles, perhaps
[05:59] <egad> okay.. so whats the command to get ubuntu to attempt to redetect network devices?
[05:59] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, nothing :-/
[05:59] <Managu> leojstewart: Either (A) there's a device file called hda1, (B) You've managed to mangle your installation, (C) you never made a complete install, or (D) you're not running Ubuntu.  Which is most likely for your situation?
[05:59] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: ok, so restore both 'Capture' and 'Mic' to 100%, and turn off 'Mic Boost'
[05:59] <tobmoox> theres too many people asking questions in this channel for anyone to help me out with this wierd error!  id appreciate a pm about it since it doesnt seem like anyone is available to help right now.
[06:00] <foogle> crimsun: Shall I get the dapper iso?
[06:00] <crimsun> tobmoox: patience, please.
[06:00] <rendo> Foogle: You can just wait 7 days for it the complete version.
[06:00] <crimsun> foogle: yes, if you can try the dapper flight 7 live cd
[06:00] <jackson> amphi: that stuff's beyond me for now (I'm still in the Linux noob stage, I'm afraid), but thank you so much for your help! people like you make me love this operating system and its community as a whole
[06:00] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, static static static that vaguely sounds like "la la la testing 1 2 3"
[06:00] <foogle> crimsun: actually none of my live cds work anymore
[06:00] <crimsun> foogle: the release candidate live cd should be out RSN if you can wait
[06:01] <varsendagger> hey i have .avi files that i think are encoded t mpeg   is there a way to tell if they are or not?
[06:01] <leojstewart> Managu Well, I'm running Ubuntu as we speak, there's no file called hda1, XP and Ubuntu seem completely installed, and I don't know how I would've managed to mangle my installation.
[06:01] <gnomefreak> 25th iirc the rc will be released
[06:01] <nickrud> tobmoox, put the exact errors on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and let everyone see. The more eyes, the better
[06:01] <tobmoox> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14572
[06:01] <tobmoox> there you go
[06:01] <Managu> leojstewart: sorry, that wasn't an option.
[06:01] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: hmph. You might try unmuting 'Mix' then.
[06:01] <IcemanV9> nickrud: trying to install oracle xe; it requires 1G swap and i only have 828Mb :/
[06:02] <leojstewart> Managu damn.
[06:02] <crimsun> too many darned broken chipsets.
[06:02] <Managu> leojstewart: Ubuntu 5.10, or 6.06?
[06:02] <leojstewart> Managu: there IS a file called hda, there IS a file called hdb
[06:02] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, in alsamixer?
[06:02] <nickrud> IcemanV9, heh. I bow out, you can keep oracle :)
[06:02] <leojstewart> Managu: 5.10 Breezy
[06:02] <jackson> another question. I have a 2GB USB drive and it some how got corrupted (probably because I forgot to unmount it. doh!) and now I can't manage to get it formatted via either GNU Parted, fdisk, or the Windows XP formatter. is there any way to restore this disk?
[06:02] <goffa_> ok... crimsun i did it with image... then i did: modinfo ieee80211 ipw2200 ... came up with version 1.0.3 for ieee80211 and 2200 diver 1.0.6
[06:02] <egad> I find it hard to believe no one in here knows networking setup here...
[06:03] <goffa_> you don't off hand know if those support wpa?
[06:03] <hyphenated> jackson: you can try running fsck on it
[06:03] <amphi> jackson: it's not hard; on the second os, don't let the installer create a normal user, then as root, do adduser --uid DESIRED_UID username
[06:03] <leojstewart> Managu: with SuSE Linux 10.1 (which used to be installed) windows was automatically mounted
[06:03] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, if so, there ain't no "mix" to mute
[06:03] <hyphenated> jackson: but if you can't format it, it's probably physically screwed
[06:03] <foogle> crimsun: problem solved I got segmentation faults and I checked my bios settings and its all good
[06:03] <IcemanV9> nickrud: heh. but is there a way to force install regardless of swap space requirement? like dpkg --force-(something) -i <package>??
[06:04] <goffa_> because when i do my sudo  sh remove_old i still get autoconf.sh missing
[06:04] <amphi> jackson: using the user id you got from /etc/passwd on the first os; thanks for your kind words, btw ;)
[06:04] <nickrud> tobmoox, ok. now, that's something who knows how the install works can at least read, and maybe know where to look
[06:04] <Managu> leojstewart: you could always try to put hda1 in.  "sudo mknod /dev/hda1 b 3 1"
[06:04] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: amixer set 'Mix' on
[06:04] <gnaunited> I have a dell inspiron 3200, it has no cdrom. I switched the hard drive into my other computer and did a dapper install. When I replaced the hard drive the xserver will not turn on. I tried this with breezy and it worked fine because of the two step install, but dapper is not the same. Any suggestions?
[06:04] <leojstewart> Managu: I just fixed the problem.  I'm a linux-newbie and realized it would be sda1 not hda1... my mistake.  Sorry for wasting your time, and thanks for the help. :)
[06:04] <tobmoox> does ubuntu have a second support channel?  it seems like this one is way too crowded right now for me to find help
[06:04] <MorbidHunger> well i got the sound card
[06:04] <MorbidHunger> and ubuntu detects it
[06:05] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: also unmute 'Stereo Mic'
[06:05] <Managu> leojstewart: ok, g'luck
[06:05] <MorbidHunger> but i plug in the speakers and ig et no s
[06:05] <MorbidHunger> sound*
[06:05] <xerophyte> why does the people use ldap then rational database ???
[06:05] <egad> will someone please tell me the command(s) to get ubuntu to attempt to redetect network devices?
[06:05] <goffa_> i'm amazed at the amount of help i'm gettng despite the business
[06:05] <nickrud> IcemanV9, depends on how the install is working. if it's looking at physical swap, and says, 'I must have a linux swap space of at least 1GB' then you're screwed. Increase your swap?
[06:06] <Managu> tobmoox: there's a support in a number of different languages, and there's #ubuntu+1 for dapper discussions.  That said, you're much more likely to get reasonable support if there's a crowd than if there's a dearth

[06:06] <Pyru> gnomefreak, hi!
[06:06] <Pyru> heh
[06:06] <MorbidHunger> anyone care to help?
[06:06] <Managu> !sound
[06:06] <ubotu> Help to fix issues with sound can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems or http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoundProblemsHoary
[06:06] <slackern> I see you guys are talking about alsa and stuff, all off a sudden my mpd stopped working after a reboot, all other sound on the machine is ok though but the logs complain about that there is no card 0.
[06:07] <tobmoox> so..does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this then?
[06:07] <Managu> !patience
[06:07] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
[06:07] <IcemanV9> nickrud: dang. alright. thanks. i know there is a way, but i figure it out later. off to increase swap. *sigh*
[06:07] <slackern> heres a sample from the logs. May 24 05:36 : problems opening audio device while playing "little_smelly_monkey.mp3"ALSA lib confmisc.c:672:(snd_func_card_driver) cannot find card '0'
[06:07] <nickrud> IcemanV9, I have bowed before software reqs more than once.
[06:08] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, neither of those exist.
[06:08] <Managu> tobmoox: is there some particular reason you feel like debootstrapping an install?
[06:08] <slackern> but doing /etc/init.d/alsa-utils start 0 and stop 0 makes a difference everywhere else
[06:08] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: I'm looking at your amixer pastebin [14571] , and 'Mix' definitely exists.
[06:08] <tobmoox> im not sure what debootstrapping is, Managu
[06:08] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: same for 'Stereo Mic'
[06:09] <Managu> tobmoox: you're installing from the install disk?
[06:09] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, however, I can neither see it in Volume Control or alsamix...
[06:09] <tobmoox> Managu: it gave me that error during installation.  yes on the install disc
[06:09] <coolzone> Hi, I have been looking at some screenshots the other day of some program resembling gkreml, yet it was another one. It was sitting on the background being transperent, I cant remember the name of it. Does anyone know what that might be?
[06:09] <crimsun> slackern: pastebin ``cat /proc/asound/cards''
[06:09] <Managu> tobmoox: rather, booting and installing from the install disk?
[06:09] <tobmoox> Managu: it gave that error during base system installation
[06:09] <crimsun> torpedo|dog: Volume Control and alsamixer don't matter
[06:09] <tobmoox> Managu: which is booting and installing from the install disc, yes
[06:09] <slackern> crimsun: 0 [nForce2        ] : NFORCE - NVidia nForce2 \ NVidia nForce2 with ALC658D at 0xe8081000, irq 193
[06:09] <Managu> tobmoox: My first though would be to run a check to be sure your system is reading the CD properly (and that there aren't any burn errors)
[06:10] <Managu> s/though/thought/
[06:10] <torpedo|dog> Hm
[06:10] <erick> ALGUIEN SABE DE COMO INSTALAR CODECS DE VIDEO Y MP3

[06:11] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell Pyru about msg the bot
[06:11] <Madpilot> ;)
[06:11] <Managu> tobmoox: another burn might help, aye.  But what I was suggesting was to run the built in cd-check; there should be an option right as you're booting the install CD to check for errors
[06:11] <meowrose> hi peeps
[06:11] <egad> hello
[06:11] <Pyru> damn u Madpilot !
[06:11] <Pyru> lol
[06:11] <crimsun> slackern: pastebin ``cat ~/.asoundrc*''
[06:11] <Pyru> Madpilot, could you help me install java properly on my ubuntu installation please? without a !tell? lol
[06:12] <slackern> crimsun: No such file.
[06:12] <nickrud> (<Tab> means press the Tab Key) In the directory where you downloaded the sun jre, type sudo aptitude install java-package && fakeroot make-jpkg jre<Tab> . When that's done, type sudo dpkg -i sun<Tab>
[06:12] <meowrose> anyone running courier?
[06:12] <tobmoox> Managu: how do you run the built in cd-check after booting?
[06:12] <specialbuddy> should I get dapper drake now?
[06:12] <Madpilot> Pyru, assuming you're running x86, Java is a fairly straightforward install - have you seen the wiki page?
[06:12] <egad> will someone please tell me the command(s) to get ubuntu to attempt to redetect network devices?
[06:12] <Pyru> Madpilot, nope ;) I'm on a laptop and just installed ubuntu
[06:12] <Pyru> I am new to linux , this is my second day
[06:12] <crimsun> slackern: pastebin bzip2d strace -fF output
[06:13] <nickrud> just when does breezy expire?
[06:13] <trelayne> egad, in mandriva, you can start and stop the network
[06:13] <Madpilot> Pyru, welcome to Ubuntu, then. I'm afraid I'm going to inflict a !tell on you, though :)
[06:13] <Pyru> alright , if it helps
[06:13] <Managu> tobmoox: I can't hand-hold you through that, as it's been too long since I dealt with a 5.10 install disk.  I'd suggest reading everything, looking for "advanced" or "more options" at the very beginning
[06:13] <Pyru> ;)
[06:13] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell Pyru about java
[06:13] <IcemanV9> question about swap - i already have 828Mb swap space, should i only add 200Mb swap to make it 1Gb? OR, should i have to create 1Gb swap?
[06:13] <specialbuddy> dapper
[06:13] <torpedo|dog> crimsun, I just might say that I have to wait until Dapper before this gets fix't.
[06:13] <specialbuddy> !dapper
[06:13] <_Pulgoki> so is it simple to switch ubuntu over to kubuntu?
[06:13] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[06:13] <torpedo|dog> Thanks, all
[06:13] <dusanyu> Pyru Welcome to sanity (atleast security :) )
[06:13] <nickrud> it's almost enough to tell people they must upgrade, just for java ease
[06:14] <amphi> _Pulgoki: apt-get install kubuntu-desktop I believe
[06:14] <gnomefreak> nickrud: java 1.4 is in repos in breezy
[06:14] <IcemanV9> _Pulgoki: yes
[06:14] <_Pulgoki> im just curious if there is anything else afterward
=== _Pulgoki is now known as Pulgoki
[06:14] <Pulgoki> because gdm and such
[06:15] <Pyru> dusanyu, thanks! heh
[06:15] <nickrud> gnomefreak, true, but some plugins & more recent java dependent sotfware doesn't work with blackdown.
[06:15] <meowrose> oyee poopoo about to hit the fan
[06:15] <slackern> crimsun: not quite sure how you mean, what is 'output' supposed to be output off?
[06:15] <meowrose> see ya'll
[06:15] <gnomefreak> nickrud: i dont think its blackdown
[06:15] <Madpilot> gnomefreak, that's only blackdown - and nickrud was being too kind, very little seems to work with Blackdown...
[06:15] <nickrud> And, the pyrotechnics on -legal and -devel are entertaining
[06:15] <gnomefreak> !javadebs
[06:15] <ubotu> In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-java5-jre is in multiverse
[06:15] <crimsun> slackern: no, strace -fF -o foo.txt mpd
[06:16] <gnomefreak> j2re1.4 is blackdown?
[06:16] <Madpilot> gnomefreak, AFAIK, yes
[06:16] <nickrud> gnomefreak, yes
[06:16] <gnomefreak> k
[06:17] <nickrud> entertaining is too flippant, I really hope they do continue their sun advocacy.
[06:17] <HugLeo> What's link gerate the sources.list automatic?
[06:17] <amphi> Pulgoki: dunno, never done it - nothing worse than perhaps 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm' I expect
[06:18] <egad> trelayne, but im in ubuntu... not mandriva hehe
[06:18] <MorbidHunger> can anyone help me?
[06:18] <nickrud> java-package may end up being history :)
[06:19] <jackson> would installing an operating system on to a hard drive from an ISO via QEMU be safe and create a stable install?
[06:19] <amphi> egad: does sudo ifconfig -a not show you the interfaces?
[06:19] <Managu> !tell morbidhunger about sound
[06:19] <CCcRocK> can someone tell me how to login as the administrator? im mad new to this ubuntu thing
[06:20] <amphi> CCcRocK: use sudo
[06:20] <CCcRocK> i made the administrator account or whatever but when i try to type it in it says i can;'t login from that screen
[06:20] <trelayne> egad, sorry..  but do you have a network startup script in /etc/init.d ?
[06:20] <Managu> CCcRocK: from what screen?
[06:20] <egad> amphi: that is correct, only loopback and ethernet
[06:20] <CCcRocK> the main login screen
[06:20] <spikeb> !tell CCcRocK about root
[06:20] <slackern> crimsun: hmm mpd is usually started with 'sudo /etc/init.d/mpd start' so i guess i'll have to figure out how to do that on a commandline and another problem it won't start giving the error until i connect with a client which tells it to start playing :)
[06:20] <amphi> egad: what's missing?
[06:21] <CCcRocK> yeah root
[06:21] <CCcRocK> how do i login as that
[06:21] <egad> amphi: something like wlan0 or the like ? hehe I dunno..
[06:21] <ikor> CCcRocK: sudo su - --
[06:21] <spikeb> look at your message window
[06:21] <amphi> egad: ok, wifi
[06:21] <egad> yah
[06:21] <amphi> egad: what card is it?
[06:22] <tobmoox> i tried another cd and got the same error.  its probably just not installable for some reason.  i'll probably just find another distro to use.  thanks for trying to help.
[06:22] <amphi> egad: /etc/init.d/hotplug restart might load the module for it
[06:22] <CCcRocK> thanks so much --;
[06:22] <amphi> egad: with sudo, naturally ;)
[06:22] <egad> amphi: its not so much a card i think.. laptop.. 'unknown broadcom device'
[06:22] <CCcRocK> ps this is my first time on IRC
[06:22] <amphi> egad: dunno about that, others in here have broadcom things
[06:23] <egad> amphi: the problem is when I installed ubuntu, I was at a location without an net connection.  so I skipped all the network stuff... if i could find a way to let it autodetect, I bet i'd be in biz
[06:23] <amphi> egad: it may not be [well]  supported
[06:24] <amphi> egad: although I think some broadcoms use the ralink chipset, which has a gpl driver
[06:24] <jackson> would installing an operating system on to a hard drive from an ISO via QEMU be safe and create a stable install?
[06:24] <slackern> crimsun: ok i got it now, at the end i connected with gmpc also so it'll do something so you get the info too.
[06:24] <amphi> jackson: heh, dunno
[06:25] <amphi> jackson: why not burn a cd?
[06:26] <mcquaid> hello, is there anyway to play back a flv file with sound?
[06:26] <mcquaid> mplayer doesn't at all, and totem xine shows video but no sound
[06:26] <spikeb> jackson: yes it would
[06:26] <slackern> crimsun: http://peterj1978.no-ip.com:8080/foo.txt.bz2 i put it up there.
[06:26] <crimsun> slackern: same issue, site/port blocked from work
[06:26] <amphi> jackson: could be worth a try, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work, you might have to do some tweaking once you booted it on the real hw
[06:26] <jackson> amphi: mostly from curiosity. and that way I could still use my main OS while installing a second
[06:27] <slackern> crimsun: doh, how do i upload a bzip to pastebin?
[06:27] <MorbidHunger> what were those links?
[06:27] <crimsun> slackern: stash it on a Web site accessible via port 80.
[06:27] <egad> amphi: hmm that didnt do anything i dont believe hehe.. I did some command to get the eth0 to show.. but i forget.. can you think of similar commands I can try? hehehe
[06:27] <slackern> crimsun: kk
[06:27] <jackson> spikeb and amphi: thanks
[06:28] <VR_> hi everyone. i just tried launching firefox, and i get this  >  http://web.tampabay.rr.com/vr/firefox-error.png
[06:28] <VR_> im not sure wtf is wrong
[06:28] <MorbidHunger> still cant get my sound going
[06:28] <amphi> egad: you'd be better off to look for your laptop model at linux-laptop.net and tuxmobil.org, and see what info you get get on the card and the driver
[06:29] <dusanyu> bare in mind alot of the info on that site is out of date
[06:29] <jackson> if I'm running a LiveCD and it, say, doesn't support my wireless card, is it possible to load a module (ndiswrapper) from an external source (NOT the CD)?
[06:29] <egad> amphi: ok thanks.. but its easier than this.. i was able to manually (w/o any extra drivers) set up the ethernet device.. unfortunately the paper i wrote the terminal commands on, i have misplaced. :c/
[06:29] <Managu> egad: silly question, perhaps, but have you tried the networking config panel (System -> admin -> networking)?
[06:30] <amphi> egad: I thought you were talking about the wifi
[06:30] <tangent> how do you change the system resolution? when I change it only applies for the current user
[06:30] <lwizardl> anyone here use mythtv on a ubuntu distro ?
[06:30] <egad> Managu: hehehe yes, no dice.. :c/
[06:30] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell tangent about fixres
[06:30] <egad> amphi: I was... but they should be similar in concept.. to get showing through an ifconfig I thought ?
[06:30] <amphi> egad: how is it confgiured? manually or with dhcp? (eth0)
[06:30] <Managu> egad: and if you "dmesg | grep wlan", do you get anything?
[06:30] <tritium> lwizardl: I have
[06:30] <egad> amphi: dhcp I do believe
[06:31] <egad> Managu: just a sec let me try
[06:31] <egad> Managu: nada

[06:31] <[NP] Tangent> gnomefreak
[06:31] <[NP] Tangent> I didn't get anything from the bot

[06:32] <Madpilot> [NP] Tangent, ^^^
[06:32] <Managu> lwizardl: I run mythtv
[06:32] <[NP] Tangent> oh
[06:32] <[NP] Tangent> there's another tangent in here
[06:32] <[NP] Tangent> how unusual.
[06:32] <MorbidHunger> help to fix sound?
[06:32] <tangent> gnomefreak, fixres is not installed by default?
[06:33] <jackson> if I'm running a LiveCD and it, say, doesn't support my wireless card, is it possible to load a module (ndiswrapper) from an external source (NOT the CD)?
[06:33] <egad> amphi: I'll try.. I was on a home connection (wired ethernet) before.. now im at a diff location (wireless) sooo.. i suspect the dhcp is just going to keep searching like the energizer bunny hehe
[06:33] <amphi> egad: just kill it
[06:33] <HugLeo> Is better aptitude or apt-get in the ubuntu?
[06:33] <Managu> jackson: possible?  Almost certainly.  Easy?  I wouldn't count on it.
[06:34] <mcquaid> is there a flv flash video) player for linux that supports sound?
[06:34] <Corey> hey guys
[06:34] <jackson> hey Corey
[06:34] <mcquaid> or do i need to convert it with mmpeg, which seems to require a recent cvs snapshot but can't get through to it's cvs server
[06:34] <Corey> Im using wine to try and open a .exe file but it comes up with an error
[06:35] <jackson> Corey: what's the error?
[06:35] <MorbidHunger> can anyone help me fix my sound?
[06:35] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: where were you in troubleshooting?
[06:36] <Corey> wine client error:2d: write: Bad address
[06:36] <Corey> admin@ubuntu:~$ Process of pid=0x0000002c has terminated
[06:36] <MorbidHunger> my brother had a sound card laying around
[06:36] <MorbidHunger> sound blaster 16
[06:36] <egad> amphi: yeah I know.. I was just hoping it would find it hehe :c/  maybe I should reinstall to let it automatically since my network devices? kind of crazy but I dont know what else to do..
[06:36] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: sudo modprobe snd-sb16
[06:36] <Corey> jackson: wine client error:2d: write: Bad address
[06:36] <Corey> admin@ubuntu:~$ Process of pid=0x0000002c has terminated
[06:36] <gnomefreak> tangent: fixres is not a package
[06:36] <MorbidHunger> i can start games, and i wont get an error about sound or anything
[06:36] <egad> since=sense
[06:36] <MorbidHunger> no such device
[06:37] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: do you have any cards detected?
[06:37] <MorbidHunger> how do i check?
[06:37] <jackson> Corey: what program is it? do you have your proprietary graphics drivers installed?
[06:37] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: ``cat /proc/asound/cards''  -> pastebin
[06:37] <Managu> egad: I think "since" was the appropriate word there =p
[06:37] <Managu> egad, nm, I misread
[06:38] <Corey> jackson: im not sure its a game called Artifact it installed alright then it wont load in terminal :(
[06:38] <egad> Managu: :cP
[06:39] <egad> so lets say I have just a loopback device listed.. how would i have created the eth0 device? would the sudo dhclient eth0 done it?
[06:39] <Managu> egad: very roughly speaking, every time you boot up, all the hardware in your system should be auto-detected.  I don't believe any part of this (excepting maybe such things as pcmcia) is specific to install
[06:39] <MorbidHunger> its doing nothing
[06:39] <Managu> egad: the upshot is that if your wireless is going to work, it should work fine without you needing to install
[06:39] <egad> hmmm
[06:39] <Managu> reinstall even
[06:39] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: ``cat /proc/asound/cards'' does nothing?
[06:40] <Corey> hey guys is it possible to use some program to get windows games to work on linux /
[06:40] <Flannel> Corey: wine
[06:40] <CCcRocK> how come when i try to open system -> administration -> users and groups, "starting users and Groups" appears in the taskbar for a second then just disapears and nothing happens?
[06:40] <Managu> Corey: depending on the game, wine (free) or Cedega (commercial)
[06:40] <Corey> Flannel: I tried using wine and got an error
[06:41] <Managu> egad: so I'd attack that first.  You'll need to know what type of wifi card/chipset you've got, and whether Linux has support for it
[06:41] <Corey> Does cedega work for everything ?
[06:41] <MorbidHunger> 0 [AudioPCI       ] : ENS1371 - Ensoniq AudioPCI
[06:41] <Flannel> Corey: nope
[06:41] <MorbidHunger>                      Ensoniq AudioPCI ENS1371 at 0x20c0, irq 10
[06:41] <Managu> Corey: nope.  If you want something that runs every windows program perfectly, run windows.
[06:41] <Corey> Well the game im trying to play is fairly old
[06:41] <ic56> !cedega
[06:41] <Corey> its nothing awseome
[06:41] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: heh, that's an ensoniq rebadged as a sound blaster.
[06:41] <CCcRocK>  how come when i try to open system -> administration -> users and groups, "starting users and Groups" appears in the taskbar for a second then just disapears and nothing happens?
[06:41] <Corey> !cedega
[06:42] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: anyhow, pastebin ``amixer''
[06:42] <Corey> My freind is making a windows emulator :)
[06:42] <kioshi> cedega should work
[06:42] <Corey> and... it will be fast
[06:42] <MorbidHunger> ok that gave me alot of stuff
[06:42] <untung> hi, i have a portable usb harddrive. How to put it work in ubuntu?

[06:49] <Corey> thanks
[06:50] <Madpilot> Corey, enemy territory, if you're into first-person shootes
[06:50] <Madpilot> shooters, even
[06:50] <_nano_> Is there a way to view CNN videos on firefox in ubuntu?
[06:50] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: so tell me the url...
[06:50] <Flannel> _nano_: do you know what format they're in?
[06:50] <Corey> enemy territory ok thanks
[06:50] <Corey> anymore :D ?
[06:50] <MorbidHunger> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14573
[06:50] <dli> _nano_, I know mplayer plugin works
[06:50] <[NP] Tangent> ubotu, tell [NP] Tangent about dapper
[06:50] <_nano_> Flannel, their website says that i need windows media player 9 plugin
[06:51] <_nano_> dli, really?
[06:52] <Corey> enemy territory was really laggy on my windows machine
[06:52] <phrowzen> hmm
[06:52] <Corey> will linux run it better ?
[06:52] <chavo> Corey, once you get enemy territory that's all you wan to play
[06:52] <phrowzen> i have never gamed before on linux, i have a decent gaming machine, a 6800GT vid card, 1GB ram, a64 3500+.. is linux even slightly comparable frames wise to running in windows?
[06:52] <wizzlefish> what's enemy territory?
[06:52] <wizzlefish> a game?
[06:52] <chavo> yes
[06:52] <wizzlefish> Linux and Windows game?
[06:52] <Madpilot> wizzlefish, yes
[06:52] <toad013> what's the module to for usb headsets
[06:53] <Madpilot> free to download, too
[06:53] <wizzlefish> oohh goody!
[06:53] <chavo> a free 3d fps it was supposed to be released as expansion for return to castle wolfenstein
[06:53] <Corey> ET was laggy when i had windows going
[06:53] <wizzlefish> but my graphics card and RAM and processor probably can't handle it
[06:53] <Corey> is it faster on linux magically ?
[06:53] <_nano_> depends how linux handles your graphics card I think....
[06:53] <chavo> Corey, I get the same performance on both
[06:53] <Madpilot> Corey, no idea, I've never run it on Windows. I'd doubt it.
[06:53] <_nano_> what kind of graphics card do you have Corey ?
[06:53] <Corey> NONE shared hahah
[06:53] <_nano_> :P
[06:53] <chavo> I've got a 6600GT
[06:53] <CCcRocK> can someone tell me how to run the system --> administration programs>??
[06:53] <chavo> oh no wonder
[06:53] <phrowzen> chavo, got a decent link to it?
[06:54] <Corey> its 128 shared thoe
[06:54] <tin_nqn> hello
[06:54] <CCcRocK> hi
[06:54] <_nano_> Corey, ok you mean you don't have a "Dedicated" graphics card...
[06:54] <chavo> phrowzen, http://enemy-territory.4players.de:1041/modules.php?name=files
[06:54] <_nano_> Corey, but you must have an integrated one?
[06:54] <Corey> no i dont :(
[06:54] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: and you don't hear any audio at all?
[06:54] <Corey> yes integrated
[06:54] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, just start one, use your user pw when Ubuntu asks for one
[06:54] <phrowzen> chavo, thank you
[06:54] <_nano_> Corey, what's the make of that card?
[06:54] <chavo> It's such a great game it's like 5 years old but I started playing about a year ago
[06:54] <CCcRocK> yeah i do that, then the program never opens
[06:54] <tin_nqn> I want mount a ntfs partition from my session in ubuntu live-cd
[06:54] <Corey> ati
[06:55] <CCcRocK> just disapears
[06:55] <tin_nqn> a try
[06:55] <Corey> radeon
[06:55] <Corey> something
[06:55] <CCcRocK> and i know the pw is correct
[06:55] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, are you logged in as the user you created during install, and using the password you made during install?
[06:55] <_nano_> so it's an ATI card ...
[06:55] <CCcRocK> yes
[06:55] <Corey> yup
[06:55] <MorbidHunger> no
[06:55] <lwizardl> tritium, Managu_away on a ubuntu distro?
[06:55] <_nano_> Corey, do you happen to know the number or name ?
[06:56] <tritium> lwizardl: yes
[06:56] <Corey> how can i check ?
[06:56] <CCcRocK> its ubuntu 5.10 if that makes any diff
[06:56] <CCcRocK> i didnt dl any upgrades yet
[06:56] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, odd - your account should have admin privs w/ your user pw...
[06:56] <Corey> it was 200M or something
[06:56] <_nano_> Corey, did you get a computer from a vendor? if so, then which one?
[06:56] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, have you enabled the root pw or anything like that?
[06:56] <CCcRocK> no
[06:56] <Corey> compaq
[06:56] <CCcRocK> i dont know how to login as the root
[06:56] <Corey> compaq presario 2500 laptop
[06:56] <CCcRocK> i am trying to enable my 2nd monitor
[06:56] <kioshi> sudo -s
[06:56] <CCcRocK> and install some things
[06:56] <CCcRocK> but i cant run any administratiove progs
[06:56] <_nano_> Corey, so may be they have the name of the graphics card in the product details
[06:57] <chavo> phrowzen, in case your wondering get the Linux 2.60 full install
[06:57] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, you can't/don't need to use root w/ Ubuntu
[06:57] <lwizardl> tritium, ok did you come across any issues with setup?
[06:57] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: are the speakers plugged into the ensoniq card?
[06:57] <CCcRocK> o
[06:57] <Corey> no they dont :(
[06:57] <Eleaf> yar!
[06:57] <tritium> lwizardl: no, not really.
[06:57] <phrowzen> chavo, :) okay
[06:57] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell CCcRocK about root
[06:57] <MorbidHunger>  yeah
[06:57] <MorbidHunger> i tried all the holes
[06:57] <phrowzen> chavo, trying to find a .us direct download link without registration, but i will use that if necessary ;)
[06:57] <wizzlefish> !hibernation
[06:57] <tritium> lwizardl: I'd stay and chat longer, but I've got a flight to catch early in the morning, and have some slides to finish.
[06:57] <CCcRocK> i read that root thing but i dont understand the sudo stuff
[06:57] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: they need to be plugged into the speaker-/line-out
[06:57] <wizzlefish> ubotu, tell wizzlefish about hibernation
[06:57] <phrowzen> woohoo found one
[06:57] <chavo> ok I just know of that site because I use the forums
[06:58] <phrowzen> such a small game... 250MB?
[06:58] <ubotu> rumour has it, hibernation is started using the /etc/acpi/hibernate.sh script.
[06:58] <lwizardl> tritium, ok becuase i'm using a p650 think thats going to be fine for video (sdtv) and music
[06:58] <lwizardl> tritium, ok np
[06:58] <chavo> yes It's quake 3 engine based
[06:58] <wizzlefish> thank ubotu
[06:58] <phrowzen> ic
[06:58] <tritium> lwizardl: p650?
[06:58] <Corey> I can run quake 3 good !
[06:58] <chavo> like I said it's an old game but it rocks
[06:58] <CCcRocK> i tried typing in sudo adduser MyName admin into the terminal
[06:58] <phrowzen> good :)
[06:58] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, open a terminal (applications->accessories->terminal)
[06:58] <lwizardl> pentium 650mhz
[06:58] <CCcRocK> then it asked for my pw
[06:58] <phrowzen> i played it briefly for windows a while ago i think
[06:58] <tritium> lwizardl: ah, okay.  ;)
[06:58] <CCcRocK> i typed it and pressed enter
[06:58] <toad013> get wine... get an emulator ... live history
[06:58] <Corey> hey who told me about wesnoth ?
[06:59] <chavo> It's all about teamwork and objectives, and some fragging sprinled in too
[06:59] <CCcRocK> then the admin apps still dont run
[06:59] <spikeb> is wesnoth any good?
[06:59] <spikeb> it looks interesting
[06:59] <Corey> im not sure
[06:59] <Corey> graphics look dull but looks good if its level up and stuff :D
[06:59] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, your default account had sudo privs then, but I guess your "sudo adduser $user admin" thing messed something up...
[06:59] <Corey> do i download source of wesnoth ?
[06:59] <IcemanV9> spikeb: yes it is, but not the best like nwn or wow :)
[06:59] <MorbidHunger> yes
[07:00] <hedrek> i've got a grub prob, grub isn't there anymore and i can't get to my system (i'm on livecd now).. i've tried everything i can think of to reinstall grub.. any ideas?
[07:00] <MorbidHunger> www.wesnoth.org
[07:00] <CCcRocK> so how do i enable the sudo privs
[07:00] <Flannel> Corey: no.  It's in the repositories.
[07:00] <MorbidHunger> or you can join #wesnoth

[07:00] <Corey> 340M
[07:00] <Corey> thanks iceman !

[07:01] <hexidigital_> how do i uninstall a program installed using  ./install.pl ?
[07:01] <_nano_> Corey, did you try playing tuxracer on your notebook?
[07:01] <_nano_> Corey, how's the performance?
[07:01] <Ademan> how do you restart the x server?
[07:01] <Corey> _nano_: i dont know what that is ?
[07:02] <Ademan> X --restart
[07:02] <Ademan> ?
[07:02] <_nano_> Corey, are you on ubuntu right now?
[07:02] <Corey> yes
[07:02] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, OK, something's gone wrong. You're going to have to reboot the machine into Recovery/Safe mode and reset your account privs...
[07:02] <Corey> _nano_: yes
[07:02] <_nano_> Corey, on the games-->arcades...do you see any game called as tuxracer?
[07:02] <hexidigital_> Ademan: Control+Alt+Backspace will close X, then type startx
[07:02] <Corey> let me look
[07:02] <_nano_> Corey, ok
[07:02] <CCcRocK> how do i do that...
[07:02] <Corey> _nano_: I dont have an arcade section :O ?
[07:03] <student> I think
[07:03] <_nano_> Corey, sudo apt-get install tuxracer
[07:03] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, on startup, hold the ESC key down to get to grub's menu. Pick Recover Mode from that menu, that'll get you to a text prompt w/ root privs
[07:03] <spikeb> thats not fair
[07:03] <spikeb> the ppc edition doesnt have a recover mode
[07:03] <Corey> _nano_: its installing
[07:04] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, then type "adduser MyName admin", then "shutdown -r now" to restart the machine
[07:04] <_nano_> Corey, ok
[07:04] <student> daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[07:04] <Ademan> hexidigital_ its not working... :-/
[07:04] <student> nie apaan sie
[07:04] <Ademan> ctrl+alt+backspace anyways
[07:04] <Corey> _nano_: brb ill try it
[07:04] <student> ga jelas bnget
[07:04] <student> :P
[07:04] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, "adduser chris admin" would be what you'd want, I guess
[07:04] <Madpilot> student, quit it.
[07:04] <hexidigital_> Ademan: Gnome or Kde?
[07:04] <_nano_> Corey, k
[07:05] <Ademan> gnome
[07:05] <Madpilot> hi HedgeMage

[07:05] <HedgeMage> what's up?
[07:05] <Ademan> well i can't shut down X in the first place
[07:06] <Madpilot> HedgeMage, not much (thankfully) ;)

[07:07] <Corey> direct rendering: Yes
[07:07] <gnomefreak> alexandre: we cant help you if we dont know what you are having issues with
[07:07] <litage> hey guys, what's the difference between the "auth" and "authpriv" syslog facilities?
[07:07] <p62> hi all
[07:07] <alexandre> tido
[07:07] <Tido> I'll try my best, alexandre
[07:07] <HedgeMage> Madpilot: good to hear :)
[07:07] <Corey> _nano_: it would run et good ?
[07:07] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, with adduser $user admin
[07:07] <_nano_> Corey, it should..coz atleast there's some 3d driver working...
[07:08] <p62> how to know have i installed winbind 3.0.14 a????
[07:08] <Corey> _nano_: i installed wesnoth but where is it installed to ?
[07:08] <litage> p62: search dpkg:    dpkg -l '*winbind*'
[07:08] <CCcRocK> madpilot, do i have to reboot in safemode before I type that in? because i just tried it and got "adduser: Only root may add a user or group to the system."
[07:08] <_nano_> Corey, i haven't installed wesnoth....what is it ?
[07:08] <Madpilot> Corey, try Alt+F2 and type "wesnoth"
[07:08] <MorbidHunger> just type in wesnoth in the terminal
[07:08] <Corey> a game where do thinkg get intalled to ok
[07:08] <Corey> ok
[07:08] <Corey> thanks
[07:09] <alexandre> sorry... i m in troubles with my connection
[07:09] <Corey> woah awseome
[07:09] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, yes, because you broke sudo for your account, you need to do it in safemode, which has full root privs
[07:09] <Corey> thanks madpilot
[07:09] <Corey> :D
[07:09] <Corey> is there a command to install et ?
[07:09] <hexidigital_> Ademan: did that help?
[07:09] <Corey> enemy territory
[07:09] <Madpilot> Corey, wiki.ubuntu.com/EnemyTerritory
[07:09] <_nano_> Corey, depends if ET is in the repos
[07:09] <hexidigital_> how do i uninstall a program installed using  ./install.pl ?
[07:09] <Tido> so I've been following the documentation for the Intel C++ compiler and have gotten it installed to /opt/intel/..., but when the documentation tells me to run a test compile with the command 'icc', bash doesn't recognize what I mean with that.  How do I get bash to know when I type icc, I want it to run the icc compiler?
[07:09] <MorbidHunger> something is like really fucked up here
[07:10] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, thanks i'll go try that and come back
[07:10] <Madpilot> MorbidHunger, language, please
[07:10] <spikeb> Tido: add icc to your path
[07:10] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, good luck
[07:10] <gnomefreak> MorbidHunger: watch your language
[07:10] <Corey> Madpilot: will typing that in terminal install it ?
[07:10] <Tido> ok, I'll research paths then, thanks!
[07:10] <Madpilot> Corey, no, visit that URL for install info for ET
[07:10] <spikeb> you bet :)
[07:10] <Corey> ok
[07:10] <MorbidHunger> this damn sound card jsut making me angry

[07:11] <phrowzen> yep :)
[07:11] <MorbidHunger> im broke
[07:11] <_nano_> speaking of buying a new computer, all linux compatible laptops are really costly...
[07:12] <MorbidHunger> i hear nothing
[07:12] <phrowzen> i just bought a new laptop for school.. friggen pricy
[07:12] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: do you have any /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc* ?
[07:12] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  i just bought a Dell Inspiron B120 for school... the only thing i cannot get to work is wireless
[07:12] <IYY> hi, I need some help getting anonymous tftp server running (for u-boot)
[07:12] <phrowzen> i gotta run windows tablet pc ed. on mine though :( *sniffle*
[07:12] <_nano_> Hexidigital, well you can get the wireless to work...my woes are with the graphics card...
[07:12] <_nano_> Hexidigital, all cheap dell laptops have ati cards :|
[07:13] <Corey> awseome installing et :D
[07:13] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  i guess i lucked out :S
[07:13] <Corey> brb gonna go try out wesnoth
[07:13] <IYY> I tried using inetd and xinetd and they both just don't do anything
[07:13] <phrowzen> Corey, im almost there.. 97% done download
[07:13] <Corey> love youz :P
[07:13] <MorbidHunger> no
[07:13] <MorbidHunger> dont have that
[07:13] <_nano_> Hexidigital, what wireless card does your laptop have?
[07:13] <Corey> phrowzen: with game you talking about ?
[07:13] <phrowzen> ET
[07:13] <IcemanV9> phrowzen: then why r u here? :P   seriously, do you have ubuntu on it? does it work?
[07:13] <Corey> awseome
[07:13] <Hexidigital> broadcom 1370, _nano_
[07:13] <Corey> well ill talk to you later
[07:13] <_nano_> Hexidigital, hehe ... broadcom :P
[07:13] <phrowzen> IcemanV9, i use ubuntu on my desktop machine
[07:14] <phrowzen> IcemanV9, i dont use my tablet much yet, i will come september
[07:14] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  i tried fwcutter, but it didnt cut it...
[07:14] <_nano_> Hexidigital, yeah the fwcutter thingy is a bit erratic....i think using the ndiswrapper thingy is still a safe bet...
[07:15] <MorbidHunger> what should i do now
[07:15] <_nano_> Hexidigital, i've dell trumobile and it works with ndiswrapper... in dapper...
[07:15] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  ndiswrapper caused me to reinstall ubuntu :(
[07:15] <Commander-Crowe> HEY
[07:15] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: use the speaker-test utility (command line)
[07:15] <Commander-Crowe> I need help
[07:15] <_nano_> Hexidigital, no way!
[07:15] <egad> I can get graphcis working, cant get wireless.. heheh backwards to your problems
[07:15] <Verithrax> Does the version of Xorg that comes with Ubuntu Breezy support transluscency?
[07:15] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, apparently starting in FailSafe GNOME is not the same thing as safe mode? because thats what i did and still got the same error: only root can add a user group to the system
[07:15] <IcemanV9> phrowzen:  my bro-in-law have tablet pc for his school(work), i try to convince to install ubuntu. no luck so far. :/
[07:15] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[07:15] <CCcRocK> madpilot, how was i supposed to login cause i guess i did it wrong?
[07:15] <Commander-Crowe> I have a mac 6300CD
[07:15] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  yep... on dapper also... reverted to breezy... still no luck... then re-reverted to MS XP :(
[07:15] <Commander-Crowe> old I know
[07:16] <Commander-Crowe> and I can't get Ubuntu livecd to boot
[07:16] <Tido> hmm
[07:16] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, no, you want the safe mode/recovery mode, nothing to do w/ gnome
[07:16] <phrowzen> IcemanV9, i would like to try it to be honest, i mean im sure i could get it to work, but i dont think i would reach the full functionality as i would in windows, by installing it i thought i would only be doing it out of curiousity.. and i dont have enough time to reconfigure everything :(
[07:16] <Tido> spikeb, can you suggest a good phrase to use for my search?
[07:16] <Tido> I'm not really getting anything
[07:16] <_nano_> Hexidigital, hmm
[07:16] <phrowzen> anyways, ET is installed, gonna give it a shot! later skater
[07:16] <spikeb> Tido: actually, i can probably find something for you
[07:16] <MorbidHunger> still nothing
[07:16] <Tido> ah thanks so much!
[07:16] <Commander-Crowe> no one/
[07:16] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, that wasnt an option though the only thing i had to choose from was the sessions...was i supposed to press someting at startup ?
[07:17] <Commander-Crowe> no one?
[07:17] <Elmore> commander has a question
[07:17] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, yes, hold the ESC key during startup, you want to get into the GRUB menu before the graphical stuff starts up
[07:17] <MorbidHunger> this is stupid
[07:17] <Elmore> ask it again commander
[07:17] <spikeb> Tido: http://www.linuxheadquarters.com/howto/basic/path.shtml
[07:17] <Commander-Crowe> I can't get my MAc 6300CD to boot Ubuntu
[07:17] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, what is the GRUB menue going to ask me?
[07:18] <Tido> thanks so much!
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> what do I push
[07:18] <Elmore> I can't get my MAc 6300CD to boot Ubuntu
[07:18] <rredd4> Commander  type a C on boot up
[07:18] <spikeb> that's an old world machine
[07:18] <Elmore> good
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> I'll try that
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> hold it or type it?
[07:18] <rredd4> hold it
[07:18] <MorbidHunger> idont see why it just doesnt work
[07:18] <Elmore> if it doesn't work, come back commander
[07:18] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, nothing, it just has a list of options to boot, one of them will be recovery
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[07:18] <Commander-Crowe> brb
[07:19] <Elmore> ok
[07:19] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, it won't need any passwords to get root access
[07:19] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, ok cool brb
[07:19] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: we haven't ruled out that you plugged the speakers into the wrong jack
=== waky is now known as waky|off
[07:19] <hedrek> !grub
[07:19] <ubotu> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
[07:19] <MorbidHunger> i plugged them into all the holes
[07:19] <MorbidHunger> even the one that has a picture of a pair of speakers
[07:20] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: and ran ``speaker-test -c2 -Dplughw:0'' for each one?
[07:20] <rredd4> with dual boot system, what minimum size partition do I need for dapper?
[07:20] <MorbidHunger> yes
[07:21] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: what about -Dplug:front /
[07:21] <MorbidHunger> i ran speaker-test on all of them
[07:21] <Commander-Crowe> It didn't woprk
[07:21] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: using the -D I just gave you?
[07:21] <Commander-Crowe> but it worked for the MacOS 8.1 reinstall disk
[07:21] <rredd4> Commander  using what os #
[07:21] <rendo> Has anyone else had any trouble with .wmv files crashing Firefox 1.5?
[07:21] <Commander-Crowe> 8.1
[07:21] <MorbidHunger> said command not found
[07:21] <paradizelost> just did a dapper install, there are no icons on the menu's
[07:21] <MorbidHunger> ill just switch to fedora
[07:22] <Elmore> me rendo
[07:22] <spikeb> heh
[07:22] <spikeb> fedora is even buggier
[07:22] <rendo> Elmore: every figure out how to fix it?
[07:22] <MorbidHunger> not for me
[07:22] <Elmore> nope
[07:22] <Elmore> happens on a livecd
[07:22] <rendo> Did you install using easyubuntu as well?
[07:22] <Elmore> my hdd died so i'm running a livecd for now
[07:22] <Elmore> yes rendo
[07:22] <Elmore> same thing
[07:22] <rendo> Well what the hell is wrong with it :@
[07:23] <rendo> It worked before. :/
[07:23] <Commander-Crowe> so no one can help?
[07:23] <rredd4> commander  did you hold the c key before u started booting?
[07:23] <Commander-Crowe> yes
[07:23] <Commander-Crowe> I press it
[07:23] <Elmore> if you run firefox from terminal and it crashes a error report will be in terminal
[07:23] <Commander-Crowe> and then turned it on
[07:23] <Hexidigital> can someone help me to uninstall a program installed with ./install.pl
[07:23] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: uninstalling a program installed that way is different based on the program that you installed
[07:24] <Hexidigital> ah, i see... thanks paradizelost
[07:24] <rredd4> Commander  it will not boot off of cd though, right?
[07:24] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: sometimes there will be something like ./install --uninstall
[07:24] <rendo> Hrm
[07:24] <Commander-Crowe> yes
[07:24] <rendo> /opt/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:  6974 Segmentation fault      "$prog" ${1
[07:24] <Commander-Crowe> but it has
[07:24] <rendo> IS what it says
[07:24] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i'll check it out
[07:24] <Commander-Crowe> when I reinstalled 8.1
[07:24] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: what program?
[07:24] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  vmware server
[07:24] <sflash> i just downloaded apache for ubuntu. looks like it works. put in localhost and picks up, anyone know where this directory is on my hd or access to httpd.conf file?
[07:25] <sflash> maybe its not even set up, just seems like it
[07:25] <Elmore> rendo : if you run firefox from terminal and it crashes a error report will be in terminal
[07:25] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: then it's vmware-install.pl
[07:25] <rendo> I did that and that's what came up.
[07:25] <rendo> I want to know how to fix that :/
[07:25] <rredd4> Commander, isn't there a boot order in your control panel?
[07:25] <Elmore> oh
[07:25] <Elmore> sorry don't no how
[07:25] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, when i typed adduser chris admin it came back "group 'admin' does not exist" ... whats that supposed to mean?
[07:25] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i messed up the install.. i need to uninstall it
[07:25] <paradizelost> and it's vmware-uninstall.pl
[07:25] <rredd4> Commander, you should be able to click on the cd
[07:25] <Hexidigital> ah
[07:25] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: you just re-do the install, it'll over write
[07:26] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[07:26] <Commander-Crowe> gotta go
[07:26] <rredd4> bye
[07:26] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, that something is badly wrong with your install of Ubuntu, I suspect...
[07:26] <Commander-Crowe> tty all tomarow
[07:26] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i get an unable to execute error
[07:26] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: and not ./vmware-uninstall.pl -   from a terminal it's only        # vmware-uninstall.pl
[07:26] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: are you running as root?
[07:26] <Hexidigital> yes
[07:26] <MorbidHunger> yeah well im going to bed guys
[07:26] <paradizelost> using sudo or logged in as?
[07:27] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: are you testing dapper, or is this with breezy?
[07:27] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, if this is a new install, I'd think of reinstalling - I think you broke something, and that might be the simplest fix... (it's a drastic fix, but...)
[07:27] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, I foolishly did a manual install because i was trying to save files from windows but ended up losing them anyway, should i just re do the install but this time the default / automatic install?
[07:27] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: and EXACTLY what command are you typing?
[07:27] <rredd4> is 5 gigs enough for ubuntu partition?  dual boot
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> i think breezy
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> but im going to bed
[07:27] <crimsun> MorbidHunger: please test with current dapper when you can.
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> ill just install fedora
[07:27] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, the default install can do partitioning too, so you can save your Windows partitions
[07:27] <crimsun> or do that, whatever floats your boat.
[07:27] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, did you do an "expert" install?
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> yeah
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> thanx though
[07:27] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, yes i did
[07:27] <Hexidigital> ./vmware-install.pl
[07:27] <MorbidHunger> ill ttyl to u guys later
[07:27] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  ^^
[07:27] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, OK, just a sec. That I know how to fix.
[07:28] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell CCcRocK about expert
[07:28] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: what is the path, do a pwd
[07:28] <Corey> nearly done downloading ET :)
[07:28] <Hexidigital> /home/hexidigital/vmware
[07:28] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, write the command that the bot just sent you down, then reboot back into recovery mode and do it
[07:28] <Hexidigital> /home/hexidigital/vmware, paradizelost
[07:29] <MorbidHunger> /dev/sequencer
[07:29] <MorbidHunger> /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
[07:29] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: did you move vmware-server-distrib?
[07:29] <paradizelost> to vmware?
[07:29] <MorbidHunger> could ubuntu not have installed something i needed?
[07:29] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i renamed it, for ease of typing
[07:29] <paradizelost> k.
[07:29] <MorbidHunger> aparently i dont have sequencer
[07:29] <paradizelost> k.  do an ls -al |grep pl
[07:30] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, note that everything between "addgroup" and "admin" on that page is one long set of commands - enter them exactly as they are there, except for that last )
[07:30] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, but do i replace you_normal_username with 'chris'?
[07:30] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, yes
[07:31] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  do you want to know that whole string?
[07:31] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  nevermind, i see it
[07:31] <paradizelost> just the first part, before it says root
[07:31] <paradizelost> what's the mode?
[07:31] <paradizelost> what part were you having a problem w/ on install?
[07:32] <paradizelost> you'll need to have installed      build-essential, xinetd, linux-headers-{uname -r}
[07:32] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i didn't install the kernel headers, so i was stuck in one part
[07:32] <ubuntu> hi there.. how to install stuff o ubuntu..
[07:32] <ubuntu> i realli am new
[07:32] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: ten you don't need to do that much of a reinstall
[07:32] <paradizelost> just install the headers and run
[07:33] <paradizelost> # vmware-config.pl
[07:33] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i hope :)  thanks for your help!
[07:33] <paradizelost> it will run you through the config again
[07:33] <paradizelost> i use vmware-server on EVERY box i have.
[07:33] <Madpilot> ubuntu, start at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
[07:33] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, alright thanks again i'll be back
[07:33] <paradizelost> so i'm very familiar w/ the install process.
[07:33] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, luck
[07:33] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  if i can only get my broadcom drivers to work on my laptop...  :(
[07:33] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: wireless i take it?
[07:33] <Hexidigital> yep
[07:33] <Ademan> what IS the getty proccess?
[07:33] <paradizelost> give dapper a shot, a lot of stuff works in dapper that didn't in breezy
[07:34] <paradizelost> Ademan: that's your consoles
[07:34] <MorbidHunger> dont have a dapper cd
[07:34] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i'm on dapper
[07:34] <ubuntu> thank ahh
[07:34] <yappa> Broadcom for my Linksys worked in dapper but not breezy
[07:34] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: ahh. k.  then TECHNICALLY.... you were in the wrong room.....
[07:34] <Madpilot> MorbidHunger, if you've got a Breezy install, you can upgrade it to Dapper
[07:34] <Ademan> paradizelost: well... uh... i have like 7 instances of that... (not windows, just the proccess) does that mean those threads are orphans? and should be killed?
[07:35] <paradizelost> Ademan: no, you have 6 consoles usually
[07:35] <Madpilot> Ademan, no, the gettys like to hang out in groups. there's a reason, but I can't remember what it is... ;)
[07:35] <Hexidigital> :) paradizelost but why go in there... only 9 days left
[07:35] <paradizelost> ctrl+alt+F1-F7
[07:35] <paradizelost> F6
[07:35] <MorbidHunger> how do i do that?
[07:35] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: true true.
[07:36] <paradizelost> not like there's anyone in there atm anyways...
[07:36] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell MorbidHunger about upgrade
[07:36] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  210... still more than the Windows rooms :-D
[07:36] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: 210, but 95% idle
[07:36] <Hexidigital> hehe
[07:37] <phrowzen> chavo, around?
[07:37] <MorbidHunger> wats the diffrence?
[07:37] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: also, whatever you do, do NOT run vmware w/ the sudo command
[07:37] <chavo> im here
[07:37] <phrowzen> chavo, mind if i PM?
[07:37] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  breaks stuff?
[07:37] <chavo> go ahead
[07:37] <Ademan> paradizelost: well, i CAN't shutdown right now, the menu doesnt have that option, so i assume some other user (probably root) has a proccess running that ubuntu thinks should not be interrupted
[07:37] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: yes.  then you get to delete your vmware preferences file
[07:37] <Hexidigital> sounds like fun
[07:37] <paradizelost> Ademan: what error are you getting?
=== ubuntu is now known as SyNitE
[07:38] <paradizelost> Ademan: if you hopen a terminal and do a sudo init 0
[07:38] <SyNitE> CAn ubuntu support wireless card?
[07:38] <paradizelost> it should shut down no matter what is going on
[07:38] <paradizelost> SyNitE: yes, depends on the card though
[07:38] <MorbidHunger> it says its up to date
[07:38] <SyNitE> what if it a usb adapter?
[07:38] <paradizelost> SyNitE: depends on the card
[07:38] <paradizelost> what chipset?
=== nalioth is now known as nalioth_zZz
[07:38] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: are you trying to upgrade to dapper?
[07:39] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, success!
[07:39] <MorbidHunger> indeed
[07:39] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, excellent!
[07:39] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: have you EVER used automatix on this system?
[07:39] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, haha thank you so much, you wouldnt happen to know how to enable dual monitors now would you ?
[07:39] <voraistos> curse automatix
[07:39] <MorbidHunger> no
[07:39] <MorbidHunger> never heard of it
[07:40] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: well, then, NEVER use it.  it breaks many things
[07:40] <paradizelost> including the updates
[07:40] <MorbidHunger> ok
[07:40] <paradizelost> !upgrade
[07:40] <ubotu> from memory, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[07:40] <MorbidHunger> is there like a cd image i can dl?
[07:40] <Flannel> MorbidHunger: EasyUbuntu is better for that sort of thing.
[07:40] <paradizelost> you did the gksudo "update-manager -d" right?
[07:40] <Madpilot> CCcRocK, nope, sorry. Hang out here and ask again in a bit, there's lots of other dual monitor users
[07:40] <paradizelost> !easyubuntu
[07:40] <ubotu> it has been said that easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
[07:40] <Ademan> paradizelost: well no its just the OPTION to shutdown is not there, not that i CANT (i'm sure from the console i could)
[07:40] <MorbidHunger> easy ubuntu?
[07:40] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, I had them running in windows, then when i made the switch to ubuntu one of them just stopped displaying anything
[07:41] <CCcRocK> Madpilot, alright thanks anyway
[07:41] <paradizelost> Ademan: are you using KDE w/ the GDM login manager?
[07:41] <mustard5> Ademan, are you on gnome and when you choose the logout option the menu fails to appear?
[07:41] <paradizelost> Ademan: or Gnome w/ the KDM login manager?
[07:41] <Ademan> just what mustard said
[07:41] <Ademan> paradizelost: no i think i'm gnome with gdm
[07:42] <mustard5> Ademan, this happens to me on occasion..and I just open another window....like a folder or a terminal and the menu 'appears'
[07:42] <yappa> Since nobody is in the xubuntu room...  does anyone know if Xubuntu is going to be released along-side dapper?
[07:42] <Madpilot> yappa, I think so, yes
[07:42] <yappa> sweeet
[07:42] <Ademan> i have 2 instances of gdm if that means anything
[07:42] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: did you get vmware working yet?
[07:42] <mustard5> Ademan, that sounds interesting hehe
[07:42] <paradizelost> Ademan: that is typical
[07:42] <paradizelost> i have the same
[07:43] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  entering my key now :) much further than before
[07:43] <_nano_> Hexidigital, you there? did you check this link for wireless? http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180936
[07:43] <crazy_penguin> good morning! // jo reggelt! // buna dimineata!
[07:43] <MorbidHunger> how do u untar a .bz2?
[07:43] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: tar -xvjpf filename.bz2
[07:43] <Hexidigital> _nano_::  thank you very much... i'll check it out ina minute
[07:43] <mustard5> Ademan, what are you using to see these two instances?
[07:44] <_ami_> Hi
[07:44] <paradizelost> mustard5: if i do a ps -eaf|grep gdm i have 2 instances on 4 boxes
[07:44] <MorbidHunger> cannot stat `lang/en/EasyUbuntu.mo': No such file or directory
[07:44] <_ami_> is Ubuntu declared the List of Selected students for Google's SOC 2k6 ?
[07:44] <MorbidHunger> this mean it wont be in english?
[07:44] <mustard5> paradizelost, yeah same for me
[07:45] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: easyubuntu 3.0 final is out
[07:45] <Ademan> mustard5: just the system monitor
[07:45] <eumario> Hidey Ho peoplerinos'
[07:45] <varsendagger> anyone have a gmail acount and windows?
[07:45] <mustard5> Ademan, choose logout from the System menu and then if the grey window doesnt appear, open a terminal, from Accessories menu and see if that makes the grey window appear
[07:45] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger:   wget http://robotgeek.org/eu/easyubuntu-3.0.tar.gz
[07:46] <yappa> what comes after dapper?
[07:46] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: then tar -xvzf easyubuntu-3.0.tar.gz
[07:46] <varsendagger> parrappa
[07:46] <paradizelost> yappa: eft
[07:46] <varsendagger> the rapper
[07:46] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: then cd easyubuntu
[07:46] <yappa> hahahaha
[07:46] <eumario> Got a problem with SSH not recognizing my RSA Key that I put in the authentication_key file on one of my servers.  Anyone got experince with using RSA keys and SSH/RSYNC?
[07:46] <paradizelost> MorbidHunger: then sudo python easyubuntu.py
[07:46] <mikebot> so like, my java was working in firefox, but now i get: "exception: java.lang.nullpointerexception"
[07:46] <mustard5> Ademan, it seems to hang for some reason on my system and opening something up makes it appear
[07:46] <mikebot> ors oemthign like that
[07:46] <Ademan> well the window appears, its just i only have hibernate, switch user and logout
[07:46] <Madpilot> varsendagger, gmail yes, Windows no - I  only use it at work. Why?
[07:47] <Taru> How do I install a burning program with ctrl+alt+F1?
[07:47] <mustard5> Ademan, ah ok
[07:47] <paradizelost> Ademan: is this the original created user?
[07:47] <Taru> Because I still cannot access the terminal normally.
[07:47] <paradizelost> Taru: what do you mean?
[07:47] <eumario> Taru: Which Burning program are you looking for?
[07:47] <mustard5> Ademan, how did you start the xserver?
[07:47] <paradizelost> using apt-get install?
[07:47] <Madpilot> Taru, Applications->Accessories->Terminal doesn't work?
[07:47] <paradizelost> Taru: try alt+f2 then type in xterm
[07:47] <Taru> I just downloaded XCDroast.
[07:48] <Ademan> paradizelost: yes
[07:48] <paradizelost> Taru: i recommend k3b
[07:48] <Ademan> mustard5: on startup
[07:48] <eumario> Taru: Is it a .deb package?
[07:48] <eumario> Taru: Or a .tar.gz package?
[07:48] <Ademan> mustard5: but i've been trying to shut it down through the console and i might have screwed things up
[07:48] <Taru> eumario, tar.gz
[07:48] <Madpilot> Taru, try just putting a blank CD in your burner - you should get a popup asking what you want to do with it
[07:48] <Taru> Madpilot, nope
[07:48] <paradizelost> Ademan: did you do any messing w/ the gdm configuration options?
[07:48] <Ademan> mustard5: i know i tried "sudo startx --help" and it created an "authorization something or other"
[07:48] <mustard5> Ademan, what have you tried in console?
[07:48] <varsendagger> Madpilot, i need a realtively fast computer that has windows to test some stuff
[07:48] <Taru> Madpilot, It is a CD-RW and I want to format then use it to burn
[07:49] <mikebot> what does this mean: "** Closing Connection: Unable to transfer data (Broken pipe)"
[07:49] <Ademan> paradizelost: i edited some resolutions in xorg.conf, which was why i wanted to restart x in the first place
[07:49] <mustard5> Ademan, I'm wondering whether you started the xserver with startx, and when you logout it will just drop you back to gdm or console
[07:49] <Madpilot> Taru, for CD-RW I think you might need k3b - install it thru Synaptic or "sudo apt-get install k3b"
[07:49] <paradizelost> Ademan: FYI, if you change the config, NEVER run startx with sudo
[07:49] <eumario> Taru: Ctrl+Alt+F1, cd <directory where you have it>, tar -xzf xcdroast-x.x.x.tar.gz  (Where the x.x.x is the version number of the one you downloaded), cd xcdroast-x.x.x, ./configure, make, sudo make install
[07:49] <MorbidHunger> how is this gonna make my comp better?
[07:49] <paradizelost> actually NEVER run startx w/ sudo anyways
[07:49] <yappa> So will most people stick with Dapper as a "stable" release until eft gets its feet planted firmly on the ground?
[07:49] <Madpilot> Taru, but if you can't use the menu items in Ubuntu, there's something broken in your install...
[07:50] <paradizelost> you will hose your .Xauthority and .ICEauthority files
[07:50] <Taru> Madpilot, synaptic dont work either.
[07:50] <Taru> eumario, ok
[07:50] <Madpilot> Taru, then something is badly wrong with your install. Did you do a default install?
[07:50] <paradizelost> Ademan: do a sudo rm -Rf ~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority
[07:50] <paradizelost> scuse me, leave the R off of that
[07:50] <Taru> Madpilot, yeah my ubuntu linux is screwed, i want to reinstall it, but to do that I need a fresh cd of ubuntu, not corrupted
[07:50] <mustard5> Ademan, from console you should be able to shutdown with ...  shutdown now -h
[07:51] <Taru> Madpilot, i had a few errors during first installation.
[07:51] <Taru> Madpilot, maybe the cd, so i am trying ot burn onto a new cd.
[07:51] <paradizelost> mustard5: i'm betting his .Xauthority and such are messed up so it's not recognizing that he has permission to do those things
[07:51] <mustard5> paradizelost, k
[07:51] <paradizelost> i'd bet he gets logged off he won't be able to log in
[07:52] <paradizelost> Ademan: fyi, if you simply want to restart the X server, CTRL+ALT+Backspace is sufficient
[07:52] <Ademan> paradizelost: it never worked for me... lol
[07:52] <paradizelost> Ademan: were you by chance trying to get Xgl working?
[07:52] <Ademan> haha no
[07:53] <Ademan> i was just sick of 1900x1200
[07:53] <Ademan> and i knew i had 1600x1024 but it wasnt in the config, so i added it
[07:53] <Taru> Madpilot, It says "sudo: unable to lookup via gethostbyname()"
[07:53] <CCcRocK> Does anyone know how to enable dualies? I had dual monitors running in windows then i switched to Ubuntu and the second one is now disabled, how can i change that?
[07:53] <mustard5> Taru, I know that error well :)
[07:53] <paradizelost> Taru: you need to make sure your hostname is in /etc/hosts
[07:53] <Taru> mustard5, o.O
[07:53] <Taru> paradizelost, How?
[07:54] <mustard5> Taru, see paradizelost's comment
[07:54] <paradizelost> you'll need to get logged in w/ root privileges somehow, probably boot to rescue mode, and edit /etc/hosts
[07:54] <mustard5> Taru, most likely you will need to boot up in recovery mode..if you haven't set a root password
[07:54] <mustard5> Taru, I can pastebin instructions if you want...
[07:54] <Taru> mustard5, root password is set, but it says denied access even in root but not in safemode
[07:54] <mustard5> Taru, I've got them all written out already
[07:54] <Ademan> paradizelost: is there an alternative to ctrl+alt+backspace ? i assume its cause i have a laptop keyboard and they're screwy, but that doesnt work for me
[07:55] <Taru> mustard5, sure :D
[07:55] <mustard5> Taru, ok..hang ten..I'll be back
[07:55] <Taru> mustard5, ok :D
[07:55] <paradizelost> Ademan: it will always work unless you change the default config
[07:55] <paradizelost> make sure you are actually using control not fn
[07:56] <_smd_> Is there another email program I can use other than evolution?
[07:56] <paradizelost> Taru: did you use sudo su  - to set the root password? or are you talking the pass. you set on install?
[07:56] <Madpilot> _smd_, Thunderbird?
[07:56] <Flannel> _smd_: thunderbird.  mutt, there are tons!
[07:56] <paradizelost> _smd_: only a few thousand
[07:56] <Ademan> paradizelost: yep, and i havent touched that config
[07:56] <squiggly> GOOD BYE PRUDES
[07:56] <Ademan> its dapper beta though... maybe it starts out with a different config
[07:56] <paradizelost> Ademan: then do a killall -9 X
[07:56] <_smd_> haha thanks.  I just find evolution slow meh
[07:56] <Taru> paradizelost, i used sudo su to get onto root, but even then it still denies me to do the installation of k3b
[07:56] <mustard5> Taru, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14576   its formatted for a forum post, so you might have to ignore the forum code thats in it
[07:56] <goffa_> well... i got my ipw driver, firmware, and ieee80211 installed
[07:56] <paradizelost> scuse me - sudo killall -9 X
[07:57] <Taru> mustard5, ok thank you ^^: D
[07:57] <goffa_> but i must not have corresponding versions
[07:57] <goffa_> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14575
[07:57] <Ademan> and then after that startx?
[07:57] <Schalken> does anyone here run ubuntu on 64bit?
[07:57] <paradizelost> Taru: then you haven't actually set the root pass?
[07:57] <goffa_> that paste was my dmesg... anyone have any idea?
[07:57] <noiesmo> hey all
[07:57] <paradizelost> Schalken: i do, but i had some stability issues.
[07:57] <Schalken> ahhh
[07:57] <ubuntu> amphi: hi i see your a 24 7 man
[07:57] <Corey> ok
[07:58] <Corey> ET didnt work very well :(
[07:58] <Schalken> do you know why you cant get flash and w32codecs on 64bit ubuntu, but you can use them on a 654bit SUSE?
[07:58] <ubuntu> mustard5 how's it going?
[07:58] <mustard5> ubuntu, good thanks
[07:58] <Schalken> 64bit*
[07:58] <paradizelost> Schalken: probably just need to get hold of the packages.
[07:58] <Taru> paradizelost, root pass is set for the same as my login pass
[07:58] <Schalken> hmm the 'restricted formats' page says you cant use them on 64bit
[07:58] <paradizelost> Schalken: i find that the easier way to do the flash, just use wine, install the windows version of firefox, and install the flash8 plugin
[07:59] <paradizelost> Taru: then su - instead of using sudo
[07:59] <Schalken> hmmm
[07:59] <ubuntu> why in the gparted gui are swap partitions always shown with a lock icon?
[07:59] <khaled> hi
[07:59] <Schalken> thats a bit of hassle just for flash
[07:59] <Taru> paradizelost, i tried that
[07:59] <paradizelost> ubuntu: because it's mounted
[07:59] <snowfaked> Taru: you can use sudo -i
[07:59] <paradizelost> Taru: did you get an error trying to login?
[07:59] <khaled> how can i repartition my working filesystem ?
[07:59] <mustard5> snowfaked, his sudo is not working
[07:59] <Taru> paradizelost, no just denying access to install k3b
[07:59] <paradizelost> khaled: cannot repartion linux while fs mounted
[07:59] <Taru> snowfaked, ok
[07:59] <snowfaked> oh
[07:59] <paradizelost> Taru: just do apt-get install k3b
[08:00] <khaled> paradizelost, any solutions ? may be .. login in as safe mode ?
[08:00] <Taru> paradizelost, it gives me gethostbyname() message
[08:00] <paradizelost> khaled: you'll need to log in w/ a livecd
[08:00] <noiesmo> Taru, hows your frostwire did it all work?
[08:00] <paradizelost> Taru: not using sudo
[08:00] <ubuntu> paradizelost: whats the umount comand from a live cd please?
[08:00] <paradizelost> the same as a umount command in normal linux
[08:00] <paradizelost> umount /path/to/mount
[08:00] <Taru> noiesmo, it works, but i have more serious issues like terminal and synaptic not launching
[08:00] <Schalken> i would just like to say Ubuntu is the best distribution EVER!
[08:00] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:00] <ubuntu> ok
[08:00] <Schalken> i have only used SUSE and Damn Small, and Ubuntu owns them hasnds down
[08:00] <paradizelost> ubuntu add a -f  if its being a pain
[08:01] <ubuntu> but how can they be mounted if i am in a live cd
[08:01] <paradizelost> Taru: try doing su - , then edit /etc/hosts and add your hostanme
[08:01] <paradizelost> then see if it work
[08:01] <paradizelost> works
[08:01] <mustard5> Schalken, glad you are enjoying it
[08:01] <khaled> paradizelost, can ubuntu universal cd start in recovery mode ?
[08:01] <Schalken> :D
[08:01] <noiesmo> Taru, not good
[08:01] <Ratzilla> how do i mount a cd?
[08:01] <paradizelost> khaled: why do you want recovery mode? you just want to repartition
[08:01] <paradizelost> ubuntu the livecd will mount the swap space so that it can use it
[08:02] <noiesmo> mount -t iso9660 /dev/hdc /media/cdrom
[08:02] <noiesmo> Ratzilla, ^^
[08:02] <ubuntu> ok  silly question i guess
[08:02] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:02] <Taru> noiesmo, yeah =(
[08:02] <khaled> paradizelost, i want to repartition my /
[08:02] <paradizelost> Taru: once you have added your hostname then the getbyhostname() error should go away
[08:02] <Kr0ntab> sup Ratzilla
[08:02] <paradizelost> khaled: i think there's a gparted livecd
[08:02] <noiesmo> Taru, do you know whats happened
[08:02] <paradizelost> http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[08:02] <ubuntu> so umount /dev/hda/ whatever hda it is?
[08:03] <mormoloc> i have GTK 2.0. how can i install/compile GTK 2.6 - 2.8?
[08:03] <mustard5> noiesmo, yeah.he's fixing it now
[08:03] <Schalken> what is hde for anyway?
[08:03] <noiesmo> mustard5, cool
[08:03] <paradizelost> ubuntu: just do a    # swapoff
[08:03] <Schalken> hda*
[08:03] <Taru> noiesmo, no
[08:03] <paradizelost> # swapoff /dev/hd##
[08:03] <khaled> paradizelost, thank you
[08:03] <mustard5> Taru, paradizelost is giving you the solution :)
[08:03] <ubuntu> ok that simple thanks
[08:03] <Ratzilla> noiesmo: thanks
[08:03] <Ratzilla> Kr0ntab: pretty good :) network is great now
[08:03] <Taru> paradizelost, wont let me add /etc/hosts access denied, gotta go to safe mode then
[08:04] <Kr0ntab> :-)  cool
[08:04] <paradizelost> Taru: DO AN # su -
[08:04] <paradizelost> k?
[08:04] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:04] <paradizelost> you will now be root
[08:04] <paradizelost> once you type in the password
[08:04] <paradizelost> now, use your editor of choice, vim, nano, pico, emacs, whatever
[08:04] <paradizelost> i.e.    vim /etc/hosts
[08:04] <paradizelost> and put your hostname at the end of the line that has 127.0.0.1
[08:05] <paradizelost> if you don't know for sure what your hostname is, do a # hostname
[08:05] <ubuntu> is there a sofware prog that can repair the sectors in a hard drive if i run ubuntu no problem but sarge no way i end up having to disable usb in BIOS so it will install?
[08:05] <Taru> "DO AN # su -"?
[08:05] <paradizelost> ubuntu: that would have nothing to do w/ the sectors on the hard drive
[08:05] <paradizelost> Taru: open a terminal
[08:05] <paradizelost> Taru: type in
[08:05] <ubuntu> ok
[08:05] <paradizelost> Taru: su -
[08:06] <ubuntu> just a thought
[08:06] <Taru> ok
[08:06] <paradizelost> Taru: it asks for a password
[08:06] <mustard5> Taru, not the space between su and the '-'
[08:06] <paradizelost> Taru: when you type in the password, what does it say?
[08:06] <Taru> paradizelost, I'm in.
[08:06] <paradizelost> Taru: k.  now type hostname and press enter
[08:06] <ubuntu> last two days working  out of a live cd is no joke
[08:06] <paradizelost> write that down EXACTLY as it appears
[08:07] <paradizelost> and FYI for all who think they need recovery mode, at your grub menu, press E on the kernel line that you use
[08:07] <paradizelost> on the line that has the kernel, type e
[08:07] <paradizelost> then add init=/bin/bash at the end
[08:07] <paradizelost> press esc, then b
[08:07] <Taru> paradizelost, when i typed hostname, it just made a space and nothing.
[08:08] <paradizelost> Taru: try doing a              cat /etc/hostname
[08:08] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:08] <paradizelost> what does that say?
[08:08] <ubuntu> even grt kernel panic in recovey mode  kernel panic not sycing I/O error READING memory image
[08:09] <Taru> paradizelost, "no such file or directory"
[08:09] <paradizelost> back to the little howto.:     you then type mount -o remount,rw /
[08:09] <ubuntu> nice 2 days now
[08:09] <paradizelost> Taru: that's your problem
[08:09] <Taru> paradizelost, =(
[08:09] <paradizelost> Taru: what do you want your hostname to be?
[08:09] <mustard5> Taru, easily fixed ;)
[08:09] <Taru> paradizelost, momo
[08:09] <paradizelost> Taru: type in     echo momo > /etc/hostname
[08:09] <Taru> mustard5, hopefully lol, im a ubuntu newbie user
[08:09] <paradizelost> then add momo to the end of the line in /etc/hosts
[08:09] <paradizelost> Taru: is this a fresh install?
[08:09] <eumario> It's alright, alot of us either are, or use to be one Taru.
[08:10] <Taru> paradizelost, /etc/hosts/momo?
[08:10] <ubuntu> mustad5: sometimes i think of widows  only at night in dreams
[08:10] <Taru> eumario, ^^
[08:10] <paradizelost> Taru: cuz that sounds like either the install got hosed, or you forgot to enter a hostname when you set up the machine....
[08:10] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:10] <mustard5> ubuntu, you are dreaming of window? :)
[08:10] <paradizelost> Taru: do you use gnome?
[08:10] <Taru> paradizelost, yeah install got screwed, so i wanna burn this program again by installing kd3
[08:10] <paradizelost> Taru: ahhh.  k
[08:10] <Taru> paradizelost, Gnome terminal?
[08:11] <paradizelost> Taru: no, the window manager
[08:11] <Hexidigital> what is the apt-get command to purge an installation? (i must be rusty, if i mess up two installs in one day)
[08:11] <ic56> Taru: now that you've created /etc/hostname , does the hostname command give different output?  I would expect it to remain unchanged until you reboot.
[08:11] <ubuntu> mustard5 i am dreaming of the day when I can get out this live cd
[08:11] <Taru> paradizelost, not familiar with that, possibly.
[08:11] <endless_us> Hi guys, Need help for setting up Nexus-s DVB card. Thank you.
[08:11] <paradizelost> because if hostname and /etc/hosts aren't right, it will complain on login
[08:11] <paradizelost> Taru: it's the default when you log in to the computer running ubuntu unless your using xubuntu or kubuntu
[08:12] <mustard5> paradizelost, I believe the host name gets blanked sometimes in the network manager when people are configuring things..and this often leads to this situation
[08:12] <paradizelost> mustard5: k.  i guess i haven't seen that happen, but i'd agree it's a possibility, that needs to get fixed....
[08:12] <ubuntu> you see the thing is if you get into a tight corner here thats everybody clams up
[08:12] <Taru> paradizelost, when i do "echo momo > /etc/hostname", it says "no such file or directory"
[08:12] <Schalken> paradizelost, what stability problems were you experiencing while running 64bit ubuntu?
[08:13] <mustard5> Taru, not the spaces in the command around the '>' character
[08:13] <paradizelost> Taru: make sure you have spaces
[08:13] <mustard5> *note
[08:13] <ubuntu> all you have to do is say kernel panic and thats its death
[08:13] <Taru> mustard5, hmm
[08:13] <paradizelost> Schalken: general lockups, it would lock when shutting down, using crossoveroffice to install stuff would lock, etc...
[08:13] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:13] <Schalken> paradizelost, hmmm
[08:13] <paradizelost> ubuntu: sounds like a bad kernel image to me....
[08:14] <paradizelost> Schalken: i gave up on it, i'm gonna be reformatting and running the k7 kernel image
[08:14] <paradizelost> Schalken: i'm also running dapper
[08:14] <Taru> paradizelost, i do have spaces, still not working
[08:14] <ubuntu> tried reinstall of  kernel image yesterday  did not work
[08:14] <paradizelost> Schalken: breezy wouldn't even install on my hardware
[08:14] <Taru> paradizelost, i did "echo momo > /etc/hostname"
[08:14] <paradizelost> Taru: do you have shell access from the outside world, i can fix it in about 3 min.
[08:14] <ubuntu> do not know how to use initrd tools
[08:14] <paradizelost> :D
[08:14] <mustard5> Taru, and it worked?
[08:15] <Schalken> paradizelost, im running dapper to, right now i cant get anything that uses opengl (screensavers, games) to work
[08:15] <Taru> mustard5, nope
[08:15] <paradizelost> Schalken: what kind of card?
[08:15] <eumario> Anyone worked with SSHD and RSA Authentication
[08:15] <paradizelost> graphics
[08:15] <eumario> ?
[08:15] <Taru> paradizelost, dunno
[08:15] <mustard5> Taru, you could just open a command line text editor and do this :)
[08:15] <Schalken> paradizelost, its integrated
[08:15] <ic56> Taru, paradizelost: the spaces aren't needed around ">".  Sounds more like Taru might have literally entered the double quotes.
[08:15] <paradizelost> Schalken: intel?
[08:15] <Schalken> paradizelost, (on board)
[08:15] <ubuntu> the thing is i took the day off work to fix it
[08:15] <Taru> ic56, i didnt add any quotes
[08:15] <Schalken> paradizelost, i think, ill check
[08:15] <Taru> mustard5, hmm ok
[08:15] <mustard5> Taru, try nano /etc/hostname
[08:16] <paradizelost> Schalken: cuz intel disables opengl on their cards.
[08:16] <paradizelost> for the most part
[08:16] <ubuntu> mustard5: have you no X
[08:16] <Taru> mustard5, done
[08:16] <mustard5> Taru, put your hostname in the file and then save it
[08:16] <Taru> mustard5, ok
[08:16] <mustard5> Taru, ctrl + o to save
[08:16] <paradizelost> ubuntu: here's a howto that kinda shows how to use the initrd tools
[08:16] <Taru> mustard5, what is the layout for it?
[08:16] <paradizelost> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=80811

[08:16] <Pyru> I am very new to linux
[08:17] <Taru> mustard5, ok
[08:17] <Schalken> paradizelost, its a SiS chipset, if that helps

[08:17] <mustard5> Taru, ctrl + o to save it   ctrl + x to exit nano
[08:17] <Taru> paradizelost, "error, writing to /etc/hostname: file or directory does not exit"
[08:17] <paradizelost> Schalken: not all sis cards support the current version of opengl
[08:18] <ubuntu> thanks i will take a look
[08:18] <khaled> Pyru, get amsn using apt-get
[08:18] <mustard5> Taru, doh
[08:18] <paradizelost> Taru: type in te following
[08:18] <Pyru> i used a script to install it, followed a tutorial khaled
[08:18] <paradizelost> touch /etc/hostname
[08:18] <Taru> ok
[08:18] <Taru> in nano?
[08:18] <Schalken> paradizelost, hmm it worked in SUSE 10.1, maybe SUSE happened to use a supported version while ubuntu doesnt?
[08:18] <paradizelost> Taru: no,
[08:18] <Taru> wait let me get out of nano
[08:18] <mustard5> Taru no
[08:18] <khaled> Pyru, i had problem downloading the TLS using amsn
[08:18] <paradizelost> Schalken: probably
[08:18] <Pyru> khaled,  this tutorial http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75276
[08:18] <khaled> Pyru, so i got it installed using apt-get.. it works fine now
[08:19] <ic56> Taru,paradizelost: sounds like /etc/ doesn't exist.  That system is seriously brain damaged.  I recommend you install from scratch rather than trying to fix it bit by bit.
[08:19] <Taru> "cannot touch /etc/hostname"
[08:19] <ubuntu> sure you got the correct url re initrd tools?
[08:19] <paradizelost> ic56: he's trying to get to a spot he can burn an ISO to do the reinstall
[08:19] <Taru> ic56, yeah, but i need the burning program installed, i got nothing in linux that i am aware of for burning this image file
[08:20] <Schalken> paradizelost, thats not very good news. is there some sort of way i can get my SiS card to support the version? a new driver parhaps?
[08:20] <paradizelost> Taru: do you have cdrecord? it would be in the terminal
[08:20] <paradizelost> Schalken: if you do some looking
[08:20] <Taru> paradizelost, how do i open terminal if it doesnt launch?
[08:20] <eumario> Taru: Type which cdrecord
[08:20] <paradizelost> Schalken: do an lspci and look up the model number of the card
[08:20] <paradizelost> Taru: in order to be doing what we've been doing so far, you're in a terminal
[08:20] <ubuntu> 400 posts for a release thats going to happen in nine days time wow
[08:20] <Pyru> khaled, do you know how i can change the icon for amsn
[08:20] <ic56> Taru: I see.  Nevertheless, if you don't have /etc , there are hundreds of things you'll need to fix before you can start burning CDs.
[08:20] <Taru> paradizelost, i press ctrl+alt+f1
[08:21] <paradizelost> Taru: then your at a terminal
[08:21] <Taru> ic56, yeah im pretty screwed since i have no way to burn on my computer, and no other burners
[08:21] <paradizelost> type cdrecord, does it do anything
[08:21] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:21] <khaled> Pyru, nope.. did not try
[08:21] <paradizelost> Taru: are all the computers desktops?
[08:21] <Pyru> khaled, do you use amsn? or have u used it b4
[08:22] <ubuntu> paradizelost: i feel unwell just looking at the url 400 posts for ubs dapper thats going to released in nine days time
[08:22] <Taru> paradizelost, yes.
[08:22] <paradizelost> Taru: then just move your cd burner to a functional computer
[08:22] <paradizelost> you can move it back when done
[08:22] <Taru> paradizelost, i type cdrecord it gives me options, but i need to pull the ubuntu image file from shared docs.
[08:22] <Schalken> i just saw those chinese characters. boy, the wonders of unicode
[08:23] <ubuntu> no mention of intrd tools
[08:23] <Taru> paradizelost, possible ot format CD-RW in terminal?
[08:23] <paradizelost> Taru: just move the cd burner to a functional computer, download the cd image to that machine, then burn it, then move the burner back
[08:23] <paradizelost> Taru: because burning may not work at all w/ how hosed that system is
[08:23] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: vmware is running beautifully, btw... thanks again
[08:24] <Pyru> anyone help me out with amsn, it freezes and stops responding at random.
[08:24] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: np.  i should write a howto on the wiki
[08:24] <paradizelost> !vmware
[08:24] <ubotu> Please check this out, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingVMWare adjusting kernel versions to your own, to get the number replace the numbers with " `uname -r" The ` is a Backtic
[08:24] <ic56> Taru: your setup is blowing my mind.  Run this for me: "ls -ld /etc".  What does it say?
[08:24] <paradizelost> nm.  already done
[08:24] <Taru> paradizelost, good idea, i thought of it, but hmm
[08:24] <bur[n] er> Taru: by chance do you have a burner and a reader in that pc?  you could boot a livecd to the reader and burn
[08:24] <siccness> Pyru: Checked error logs?
[08:24] <paradizelost> Taru: it's gonna be easier to do that than try to get what you have working
[08:24] <Taru> bur[n] er, reader? i just have the burning dvd/cd drive
[08:24] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: yeah, but you explain so people can actually understand:)
[08:24] <Taru> paradizelost, true
[08:24] <Pyru> siccness, Im new to linux this is my second day
[08:25] <Taru> ic56, one sec
[08:25] <Pyru> no clue on how to do so.
[08:25] <siccness> Ah ok
[08:25] <ubuntu> whats the sawpoff command there -hv -a and -v?
[08:25] <Pyru> siccness, you could guide me , would be much appreciated hehe
[08:25] <bur[n] er> Pyru: it's msn... their servers have been goin nutz the past day
[08:25] <bur[n] er> Pyru: it's been affecting me with gaim too
[08:25] <siccness> Heh, now I'm trying to work out the command..hmm
[08:25] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: and that wiki is for workstatino
[08:25] <Hexidigital> how about you make !vmserver
[08:25] <Hexidigital> :)
[08:25] <Pyru> bur[n] er, my gaim has worked fine for the passed 2 days, but amsn just stops responding and i cant seem to find th eprocess to kill as well
[08:26] <paradizelost> !vmserver
[08:26] <ubotu> paradizelost: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[08:26] <bur[n] er> Pyru: i'll find the process to kill for ya... one sec :)
[08:26] <siccness> ps, kill -9 [PID] 
[08:26] <Pyru> bur[n] er, thanks
[08:26] <ubuntu> i know about vmserver beta ask
[08:26] <Pyru> bur[n] er, i tried a killall gnome-panel didn't work to kill it but killed all my other apps
[08:27] <ubuntu> i have a script that will make bb 5-10 server ready to install
[08:27] <siccness> Heh
[08:27] <bur[n] er> Pyru: it's definately not gnome-panel ;)
[08:27] <Pyru> as I said im new hehe sorry
[08:27] <bur[n] er> Pyru: did you try a "ps ax |grep msn" in a term?
[08:27] <Taru> ic56, drwxr-xr-x 104 root root 4096 May 24 07:04 /etc (in blue letters)
[08:27] <kuja> Pyru: Mike?
[08:27] <kuja> Oh, nevermind.
[08:27] <neal_> how do u restart samba in ubuntu
[08:27] <kuja> Taru: Mike?
[08:27] <Taru> ic56, /etc in blue letter
[08:27] <Pyru> kuja, nope
[08:27] <Taru> kuja, yes?
[08:27] <kuja> Pyru: Sorry
[08:27] <Pyru> bur[n] er, I just typed that.
[08:27] <bur[n] er> i dont' have amsn installed, and i'm too lazy to install it... can anyone else tell Pyru and i the binary name?
[08:28] <kuja> Taru: Did you reburn yet?
[08:28] <bur[n] er> Pyru: any results?
[08:28] <ic56> Taru: that means /etc exists and my interpretation of your setup is wrong.
[08:28] <endless_us> any one here who can help me with nexus-s setup? PLEASE\
[08:28] <ic56> Taru: I see no reason why you should be unable to create /etc/hostname
[08:28] <Pyru> bur[n] er, check pm.
[08:28] <Taru> ic56, o.O
[08:28] <Taru> kuja, not yet
[08:29] <neal_> Does anyone know how to restart samba?
[08:29] <paradizelost> neal_: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
[08:29] <ic56> Taru: type this for me: "mount |grep ' / '" (the spaces around the slash are important).  There should be one line of output.  What does it say?
[08:30] <kuja> ic56: He had problems yesterday with his host* files being broken symlinks.
[08:30] <Taru> ic56, ok
[08:30] <kuja> ic56: The culprit being `lessdisks'
[08:30] <Taru> single quotes around the slash?
[08:30] <kuja> Taru: Yeah
[08:30] <kuja> mount | grep ' / '
[08:30] <Taru> kuja, ok
[08:30] <ic56> kuja: I see.  Thanks for the background.
[08:30] <kuja> np
[08:31] <paradizelost> ubotu tell Hexidigital about vmserver
[08:31] <ubuntu> paradizelost take a peak at this please http://pastebin.ca/58581
[08:32] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: good man!
[08:32] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k and what am i looking at?
[08:32] <ubuntu> how to trun off swap
[08:32] <neal_> Paradizelost how do u add a user to samba
[08:32] <paradizelost> ubuntu: ok,  in a terminal,   sudo swapoff /dev/hda2 && sudo swapoff /dev/hda5
[08:33] <siccness> Pyru: in terminal, type: locate amsn
[08:33] <paradizelost> neal_: i do mine w/ no authentication
[08:33] <paradizelost> i'm in a trusted LAN
[08:33] <neal_> how do u do that
[08:33] <paradizelost> w/ only me and a select few others
[08:33] <paradizelost> change security to share instead of user
[08:33] <Taru> ic56, "rootfs on / type rootfs (rw) /dev/hda1 on / type ext3 (rw)
[08:33] <paradizelost> there's a spot that says            security = share
[08:33] <paradizelost> ubuntu: why do you have 2 swap partitions on the same drive?
[08:34] <ubuntu> good question there are two distros ubuntu and srage?
[08:34] <ic56> Taru: ok.  Are you booted from an install CD?
[08:34] <paradizelost> ubuntu: the swap space can be shared
[08:34] <paradizelost> *shared
[08:35] <Taru> ic56, I am running w/o cd atm.
[08:35] <ubuntu> what do you suggest ?
[08:35] <neal_> paradizelost how do i do that
[08:35] <ic56> Taru: so my mount |grep command gave you 2 lines of output, right?
[08:35] <Taru> ic56, my original install cd is corrupt, i meant to reburn it on a new cd, on this comp, but i may have ot move burner to another computer like paradizelost mentioned.
[08:35] <Taru> ic56, yes
[08:35] <paradizelost> neal_: it's in your /etc/samba/smb.conf file
[08:36] <paradizelost> neal_: or are you using the POS swat???
[08:36] <paradizelost> ;)
[08:36] <ubuntu> the thing i cannot access my ubuntu server on hda1 its on fluxbox wirh vmware o dear my poor data well i will keep on trying that nasty sarge install upset my disk
[08:37] <paradizelost> ubuntu: are you saying you used vmware, gave it physical access to the hard drive, and did another linux install?
[08:37] <paradizelost> please say no.....
[08:37] <ic56> Taru: you've done something wierd with the way you booted.  You have two filesystems overlapping each other.  I know Linux can handle this under special circumstances but I don't know if you've done it right.
[08:37] <Taru> ic56, cdrecord version does not support CD-RW/DVD-R.
[08:38] <zukero> how can I list all my IDE drives in ubuntu, to make sure a new is well detected ?
[08:38] <Taru> ic56, yeah screwed up somewhere, i encountered some errors while installing it and skipping some.
[08:38] <paradizelost> zukero: most of the time open a terminal and do a #dmesg|grep hd
[08:38] <paradizelost> zukero: or you can install gparted and use it to pull up a list of drives
[08:38] <zukero> paradizelost : even if not a hd (DVD Burner)
[08:38] <ic56> Taru: is this a new install?  How did you install if you don't have a readable CD?
[08:39] <paradizelost> zukero: a dvd burner would show up as hd##
[08:39] <paradizelost> something
[08:39] <zukero> k
[08:39] <Taru> ic56, this was installed a few days ago, and it probably was a corrupted cd.
[08:39] <Taru> ic56, i wish to re-install it on a new cd and hope there is no problems.
[08:39] <zukero> paradizelost : great, found it :)
[08:39] <zukero> thx
[08:40] <Taru> ic56, i just found a random cd that happened to be blank, and i guess it wasnt in good condition ; ;
[08:40] <paradizelost> Taru: just make sure you use the same burner that you use in both comps.  i have a burner that's going out, it works fine w/ its own cd's, but if i  burn an install cd w/ it, and try to use it in another machine, it doesn't work
[08:40] <Schalken> paradizelost, this is what the SiS site has to say: "Linux Kernel 2.4.20 (Redhat 9.0) has default driver for SiS741" (my card)
[08:40] <Taru> paradizelost, ok
[08:40] <paradizelost> Schalken: they mean the low end, no accelleration driver.
[08:40] <ic56> Taru: do you have the option of installing something else that will let you burn CDs?  That might save you a lot of grief.
[08:40] <Taru> paradizelost, i probably will just move the burner now.
[08:40] <ubuntu> what i am saying is that vmware is on bb server hda1, i did a sarge install on a small bit of my disk just to see if a howto would work some project i am going to try and but the grub back on hda1 so my server bb will maybe boot without error or good ness must phone work to get another days hoilday well thats linux
[08:40] <paradizelost> Taru: would probably be the fastest
[08:41] <Taru> ic56, a windows CD that has a burning program, but not sure if its linux friendly,
[08:41] <Taru> paradizelost, :D
[08:41] <paradizelost> ubuntu: what's your fstab for your ubuntu install?
[08:41] <paradizelost> is /dev/hda1 your /boot on ubuntu?
[08:42] <ubuntu> just a sec i pastbined it yesterday
[08:42] <distanceisdeath> hello?
[08:42] <Schalken> paradizelost, oh, well thats no good
[08:42] <ic56> Taru: So long as you choose to burn an "ISO image", windows will work fine.  But try paradizelost's suggestion to read using the same CD drive that burned the CD.
[08:42] <ubuntu> no  but i wold like it to be it was before
[08:43] <distanceisdeath> Is it possible to install linux on the same hd?
[08:43] <Schalken> paradizelost, does Ubuntu use Xfree86 or X Server?
[08:43] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: same hd as waht?
[08:43] <distanceisdeath> hard drive
[08:43] <paradizelost> Schalken: uses xorg now
[08:43] <Taru> ic56, windows is gone from this computer, i will just move my burner to another computer and try from there.
[08:43] <paradizelost> XFree86 is essentially dead...
[08:43] <Schalken> humph
[08:43] <paradizelost> xorg is the fork, the BETTER version
[08:43] <Taru> Be back later, see ya, and thanks for all your help guys. ^^
[08:43] <ic56> Taru: out of curiosity, try this for me (it may crash your computer): sudo umount /
[08:43] <ic56>  sudo mount /dev/hda1 /
[08:44] <tillicollaps3> can someone help me toremove a wrong installation of wine...i can't find the files
[08:44] <distanceisdeath> is it possible to have linux and xp on the same hard drive? and dual boot?
[08:44] <paradizelost> well, Hexidigital, tomorrow, i'm gonna get started on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingVMWareserver
[08:44] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: yes
[08:44] <distanceisdeath> how would i go about doing this?
[08:44] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: you just need to have some free space on the drive
[08:44] <kuja> ic56: Err, forgot to tell him to burn it at 2x.
[08:44] <paradizelost> and then you run the installer
[08:44] <kuja> ic56: Last time he burned it at 4x.
[08:44] <distanceisdeath> i have plenty of space
[08:45] <distanceisdeath> where is the installer?
[08:45] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: UNPARTITIONED space?
[08:45] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: THE CD
[08:45] <paradizelost> :D
[08:45] <distanceisdeath> i just sent a request for the cd
[08:45] <gnuyen> Hi guys, is the new nvidia driver going to make it into Dapper?
[08:45] <Hmmmm> guys, is ubuntu stable release for 1st june confirmed?
[08:45] <distanceisdeath> is there a way without the cd?
[08:45] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: then you could download the cd?
[08:45] <ic56> kuja: is that an issue w/ linux CD-R/RW drivers or with the hardware?
[08:45] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: not that i know of
[08:45] <distanceisdeath> do i have to burn it?
[08:46] <bur[n] er> gnuyen: i think it already did... and the kernel driver didn't get updated yet... though I'm not positive
[08:46] <kuja> ic56: Well, it's generally safer to burn at a lower speed.
[08:46] <paradizelost> gnuyen: don't know for sure, but i just use easyubuntu to install it
[08:46] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: yes
[08:46] <distanceisdeath> dvd? or cd rom?
[08:46] <tillicollaps3> can someone help me toremove a wrong installation of wine...i can't find the files
[08:46] <kuja> ic56: I think it's an issue with the hardware, but I'm not sure. I've heard it a lot.
[08:46] <paradizelost> CD
[08:46] <distanceisdeath> okay
[08:46] <gnuyen> where can someone look to see progress or notes on a particular pacage
[08:46] <distanceisdeath> and i just place the files on the cd?
[08:46] <distanceisdeath> or on different cds?
[08:46] <ic56> kuja: thx
[08:47] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: you download the ISO file, and burn the image to a CD
[08:47] <distanceisdeath> one iso file per disc?
[08:47] <paradizelost> w/ nero or whatever burning software you use
[08:47] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: there will be 1 iso total to do the install
[08:47] <paradizelost> !install

[08:48] <gnuyen> even though they fixed a rather severe bug
[08:48] <ic56> tillicollaps3: try apt-get remove <package name>
[08:48] <paradizelost> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d14583
[08:49] <paradizelost> neal_: there you go ^
[08:49] <paradizelost> you can use that, and just make the appropriate changes
[08:49] <tillicollaps3> i've tried but it says that wine it's not installed
[08:49] <ic56> gnuyen: try /join #ubuntu+1
[08:49] <tillicollaps3> the installation was from sources
[08:49] <paradizelost> tillicollaps3: how did you install wine?  w/ apt-get ?
[08:49] <paradizelost> !dapper
[08:49] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[08:50] <tillicollaps3> no from sources
[08:50] <paradizelost> tillicollaps3: .deb sources or from tar sources?
[08:50] <tillicollaps3> tar
[08:50] <ubuntu> paradizelost; here is fstab  http://pastebin.ca/58582
[08:50] <paradizelost> tillicollaps3: from the wine site?
[08:51] <paradizelost> ubuntu:  k.  use cfdisk and make /dev/hda1 bootable again
[08:51] <tillicollaps3> no, i just took it from a cd of linux-magazine
[08:51] <paradizelost> tillicollaps3: look in the stuff you got from their site and check the readme for removal instructions
[08:51] <paradizelost> what distro you using?
[08:51] <ubuntu> paradizelost not use cfdisk befor might need some help
[08:52] <tillicollaps3> ub dapper
[08:52] <ic56> tillicollaps3: do this: "tar tf <tar file> |xargs rm".  It gets the list of files from the tar files and removes each one from the disk.
[08:52] <neal_> thanks
[08:52] <paradizelost> tillicollaps3: try #ubuntu+1 or #wine
[08:52] <neal_> how do u edit a file
[08:52] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k
[08:53] <Schalken> paradizelost, Ubuntu using Xorg must be the problem then, because according to the SiS site there are no Xorg gfx accelleration drivers for my card. does that mean im screwed?
[08:53] <paradizelost> Schalken: for the time probably
[08:53] <sola6662> yo all i have a prob
[08:53] <ic56> tillicollaps3: run it without the  "|xargs rm" to see what it's gonna remove.
[08:53] <Schalken> lol

[08:53] <ubuntu>  here is a good url for vmware on bb 5-10 server with fluxbox its two fantastic scripts anybody need it
[08:54] <paradizelost> ubuntu: getting vmware server running on breezy using blackbox for the gui should be no different than getting it running otherwise
[08:54] <tillicollaps3> ok now i'm trying
[08:54] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k. open a terminal
[08:54] <Schalken> paradizelost, if openGL doesnt work, should I ever expect to get video playback working either?
[08:54] <paradizelost> Schalken: video's should work
[08:54] <ubuntu> ok have cfdisk in my view
[08:55] <paradizelost> Schalken: don't need opengl for playback, it certainly helps though
[08:55] <sola6662> i was useing the howto to get into my NTFS format HDD i used for storeing files i tired to get into it in windows XP to do some school work and it didit want to work how can i unmount hdb1?
[08:55] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k, you did a sudo cfdisk /dev/hda correct?
[08:55] <tillicollaps3> i have to give the command from the extracted sources?
[08:55] <paradizelost> sola6662: sudo umount /dev/hdb1
[08:55] <ubuntu> i am in root then cfdisk hda1 is mounted
[08:55] <sola6662> life saver
[08:55] <ic56> tillicollaps3: come again?
[08:55] <ubuntu> at /mnt
[08:55] <Schalken> paradizelost, damn. i need one of those awesome nVidia cards that have good Linux driver support
[08:55] <paradizelost> ubuntu: mounted shouldn't be an issue
[08:56] <ubuntu> ok
[08:56] <paradizelost> Schalken: i have a mix of nvidia and ati, i do like the nvidia better
[08:56] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k.  select hda1
[08:56] <tillicollaps3> what?
[08:56] <paradizelost> should already be selected
[08:56] <ic56> tillicollaps3: I did not understand your question.
[08:56] <ubuntu> yes it is
[08:56] <paradizelost> ubuntu: and is bootable selected at the  bottom?
[08:56] <ubuntu> yes
[08:57] <paradizelost> ubuntu: k press enter
[08:57] <ubuntu> ok
[08:57] <paradizelost> ubuntu: just to confirm, /dev/hda1 is your ubuntu install that you want to boot, correct?
[08:57] <paradizelost> before we write the changes
[08:57] <ubuntu> correct
[08:58] <Schalken> does anyone have any reccommendations on a low-end graphics card with good support for Linux (and Xorg)?
[08:58] <paradizelost> ubuntu:  k.  now use the L & R arrow keys and select write
[08:58] <paradizelost> Schalken: an nvidia geforce mx4000 should suffice....
[08:58] <paradizelost> ubuntu: then quit
[08:58] <Schalken> paradizelost, thnx. ill look it up
[08:58] <paradizelost> ubuntu: then you reboot
[08:59] <salman> Intel 815, 855, 915
[08:59] <paradizelost> Schalken: it will work, but not the best
[08:59] <salman> Schalken: Intel 815, 855, 915
[08:59] <sflash> how can i run a .deb file?
[08:59] <paradizelost> Schalken: i'd go higher end personally, but $$$ gets up there
[08:59] <sflash> or can
[08:59] <paradizelost> sflash: dpkg -i filename.deb
[08:59] <paradizelost> will install it
[08:59] <sflash> cool
[08:59] <ubuntu> write is hightlighted
[08:59] <paradizelost> salman: who is that directed to?
[09:00] <paradizelost> ubuntu: press enter
[09:00] <paradizelost> ubuntu: then highlight quit and press enter again
[09:00] <paradizelost> ubuntu: then reboot to see that it worked
[09:00] <ubuntu> are you sure you wnt to write partition table o disk
[09:00] <Schalken> paradizelost, considering there aren't many games for linux, i dontwant to spend anymore money than i need to to get a screensaver going
[09:00] <paradizelost> ubuntu: yes
[09:01] <Schalken> paradizelost, and maybe play some bzflag
[09:01] <paradizelost> Schalken: there are getting to be more.  Unreal Tournament and Quake 4 for example
[09:01] <paradizelost> Schalken: plus you have Xgl to look forward to
[09:01] <Schalken> paradizelost, whats xgl?
[09:01] <paradizelost> !xgl
[09:01] <ubotu> XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/
[09:01] <paradizelost> look at the pretty videos
[09:01] <ubuntu> ok more than one primary partition is marked as bootable DOS MBR cannot boot this
[09:01] <neal_> How do u edit a file
[09:02] <Schalken> neal_, you, like, click on it
[09:02] <paradizelost> neal_: gvim, vim, nano, pico, gedit, emacs, to name a few
[09:02] <MorbidHunger> hey how do i change the master volume?
[09:02] <neal_> whenever i click on them their read only
[09:02] <ubuntu> paraizelost: see my post just now
[09:02] <paradizelost> ubuntu: unmakr /dev/hda3 from bootable
[09:02] <paradizelost> *unmark
[09:02] <ubuntu> how please
[09:02] <sola6662> i did and it came up it wasnt mounted
[09:02] <bur[n] er> neal_: you might need to be sudo
[09:03] <paradizelost> ubuntu: select it in the window using the up/down arow keys, and unmark it the exact same way we marked /dev/hda1
[09:03] <sola6662> if this is true all i need todo is boot in windows and try to get in
[09:03] <Hexidigital> vmware installation successful.... hopefully laptop Dapper install goes just as well
[09:03] <Schalken> neal_, probably a permissions problem then. try going into the files properties and check the 'edit' boxes under 'permissions'
[09:03] <sflash> is there anyway to add .deb file to synaptic?
[09:03] <ubuntu> ok selected but bootable is highlighted below
[09:04] <Schalken> neal_, otherwise you might need to execute the editing program with sudo
[09:04] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: if i knew how to do a .deb, i'd make one for vmware server, but it's still beta so it changes all the friggin time
[09:04] <paradizelost> ubuntu: yess, press enter now, this will unmark the bootable flag
[09:04] <ubuntu> how to unmark
[09:05] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: yes.. i got it to do what i need... running a ms machine for my printer :)
[09:05] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: what printer?
[09:05] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: lexmark x75
[09:05] <paradizelost> to all newbies, something for you to try sometime, a command called screen
[09:05] <paradizelost> !screen
[09:05] <ubuntu> ok boot flag has dissaped
[09:05] <ubotu> I guess screen is a terminal multiplexer http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[09:05] <paradizelost> Hexidigital: you need a sledgehammer
[09:05] <paradizelost> ubuntu: now try writing
[09:05] <ubuntu> but in label section its stil has the / sign
[09:05] <paradizelost> ubuntu: make sure that /dev/hda1 is still flagged bootable
[09:05] <ubuntu> ok
[09:06] <paradizelost> ubuntu: don't worry about the label
[09:06] <camilo> night
[09:06] <ubuntu> yes hda 1 is flaged as botable
[09:06] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: and i got a free dell 710, because i called and screamed at them for losing my laptop
[09:06] <Hexidigital> but it's a lexmark in disguise
[09:06] <tillicollaps3> ic56: it has removed nothing
[09:06] <paradizelost> dell 710 printer?
[09:06] <paradizelost> it's a lexmark
[09:06] <Hexidigital> yes
[09:06] <ubuntu> ok here is what it says
[09:07] <ubuntu> wrote partirion table , bur re-read table failed  reboot to update table
[09:07] <paradizelost> ubuntu don't worry about that
[09:07] <paradizelost> just quit and reboot
[09:08] <ubuntu> ok is hda1 ok now or?
[09:08] <camilo> someone knows how to properly configure a keyboard on an ibook ? thnx
[09:08] <paradizelost> ubuntu should be
[09:08] <paradizelost> you have a livecd handy just in case?
[09:08] <ubuntu> it has boot flag but did we write it?
[09:08] <vook> I seek direction or guidance on making flash work in firefox on amd64.  I've tried many times and failed.  Anyone have any links or resources that may help?
[09:09] <paradizelost> ubuntu: it says it wrote it, it just needs to reboot for it to completely take effect
[09:09] <Schalken> ubuntu is such a beautiful distro
[09:09] <sola6662> be back in a few days
[09:09] <paradizelost> vook: install the windows firefox in wine, then install the flash8 plugin
[09:09] <paradizelost> :D
[09:09] <ubuntu> remember it could not write it as hda3  was bootable at the time yes hda3 is not bootable now
[09:10] <paradizelost> ubuntu: basically, it's like back in DOS, you did an FDISK but had to reboot before the system saw the change
[09:10] <paradizelost> ubuntu: corret
[09:10] <paradizelost> correct
[09:10] <vook> paradizelost, there must be a better way.
[09:10] <paradizelost> do a cfdisk /dev/hda again and make sure it looks like you want
[09:10] <Schalken> paradizelost, is that REALLY only way to get flash working on AMD64?
[09:10] <ubuntu> yes that sounds correct
[09:10] <paradizelost> vook- it's the only way if you want flash 8 on linux
[09:10] <Schalken> paradizelost, how come SUSE can do it though?
[09:10] <paradizelost> Schalken: the only flash actually avaialable for linux is 7 or lower
[09:10] <vook> I don't think so, I know it can be done.
[09:11] <paradizelost> there is no flash8 for linux.
[09:11] <paradizelost> look all you want
[09:11] <paradizelost> you can get flash 7
[09:11] <paradizelost> i'm not just talking amd64 either
[09:11] <ubuntu> so lets asume that hda1 is now bootable
[09:11] <Schalken> paradizelost, well can flash 7 be used on AMD64?
[09:11] <paradizelost> ubuntu: then reboot
[09:11] <paradizelost> Schalken: never tried it....
[09:11] <vook> paradizelost, i understand that, but there must be a way to get it going in firefox on amd64 without wine.
[09:11] <paradizelost> :D
[09:11] <Schalken> hmmm
[09:12] <ubuntu> ok i hope it works should i delete sare plus swap make no diffrence i guess
[09:12] <paradizelost> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=112418
[09:12] <ubuntu> sarge
[09:12] <vook> I've heard of success from the gentoo camp, but who knows what kind of trivial process they'd put me through.
[09:12] <paradizelost> ubuntu: not for the moment, don't change more at 1 time than you have to.  makes troubleshooting easier
[09:12] <paradizelost> vook: see above link
[09:13] <paradizelost> !flash
[09:13] <ubotu> Installation & troubleshooting for Flash is covered in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[09:13] <ubuntu> o must  umount hda1 first
[09:13] <Schalken> how good are the free alternatives to flash i hear about?
[09:13] <paradizelost> ubuntu - the reboot process does that for you
[09:13] <paradizelost> Schalken: never used them
[09:13] <neal_> paradizelost i can't access anything
[09:13] <ubuntu> ok see you later with the results
[09:13] <twager> Can anyone tell me if I can alter the file availability colours in ktorrent ?
[09:13] <paradizelost> neal_: did you put that file in place, make the appropriate changes to make it point to your locations and then restart samba?
[09:14] <neal_> yes
[09:14] <vook> paradizelost, bless you.  I'm on it.
[09:14] <paradizelost> !samba
[09:14] <ubotu> samba is probably https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba or http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba2/book/toc.html
[09:15] <twager> neal_ yes to colours ?
[09:15] <paradizelost> twager: yes to my question
[09:15] <twager> sorry..
[09:16] <paradizelost> man, i'm gonna have to head to bed soon.  i have to be to work in less than 6 hours
[09:16] <varsendagger> hey is ther a gui to creat .zip files?
[09:16] <joe__> How do I get firefox to use the mplayer plugin instead of totem to play video files in the browser?
[09:16] <paradizelost> varsendagger: archive manager probably can
[09:16] <paradizelost> joe__: install the mplayer-plugin
[09:16] <paradizelost> !mplayer
[09:16] <ubotu> rumour has it, mplayer is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MplayerInstallHowto  For compiling, see: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31061
[09:16] <varsendagger> paradizelost, i don't think it does
[09:16] <paradizelost> !mplayer-plugin
[09:16] <ubotu> paradizelost: Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[09:17] <paradizelost> varsendagger: is there a reason you want .zip and not .tar .tar.gz or .bz2?
[09:17] <tonyyarusso> Okay, I'm going to need to have aptitude upgrade run for a while, but cut it off before it's done, and just pause it where it is.  What's the safest way to do that?  shutdown, kill aptitude, kill wvdial, other?
[09:17] <Schalken> boy, i wish i didnt exceed my download limit by downloading linux distros so many times. now im on dialup speed! its killing me!
[09:17] <joe__> paradizelost: I've installed that, but firefox still tries to use the totem plugin
[09:18] <paradizelost> Schalken: i download 40-60GB of data/mo
[09:18] <paradizelost> joe__: try removing the totem plugin
[09:18] <Schalken> paradizelost, crap thats most of my (80gb) HD
[09:18] <paradizelost> joe__: my brain is too fried tonight to be of much more help...
[09:18] <tonyyarusso> Schalken: Well, I'm trying to do Dapper updates on dialup now, so I can almost relate.
[09:18] <paradizelost> Schalken: mostly tv shows - watch then delete, or linux ISO's, or all the damn dapper updates...
[09:19] <Schalken> tonyyarusso, omg thats what im doing aswel it says its going to take 9 hours
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-work
[09:19] <paradizelost> luckily my ISP doesn't put a limit on the bandwidth
[09:19] <paradizelost> i'm in the middle of nowhere...
[09:19] <tin_nqn> from a newbie: how can I know my IP inside my net?
[09:19] <varsendagger> paradizelost, yes i want my friend the windows user to access it
[09:20] <Schalken> paradizelost, and i thought 12GB was practically no limit. i thought wrong.
[09:20] <paradizelost> tin_nqn: open a terminal, type ifconfig eth0
[09:20] <tonyyarusso> Schalken: 13 here.  Problem is I can't still be connected in the morning in case someone else wants to get on, so I have to figure out how to stop it after a few hours.
[09:20] <Schalken> lol!
[09:20] <tin_nqn> thanks
[09:21] <paradizelost> tonyyarusso: you could write a script to start the program, track the pid, then have a cron job kill the pid at a specified time
[09:21] <paradizelost> but that would kill it not pause it
[09:22] <tonyyarusso> paradizelost: Well, aptitude seems to be smart enough to resume where it left of with package downloading.
[09:22] <paradizelost> tonyyarusso: then that might be the way to go
[09:22] <tonyyarusso> paradizelost: All right, we'll give it a shot.
[09:22] <paradizelost> it'll be a fun script though.....
[09:22] <Schalken> paradizelost: so, flash can be used on AMD64 by replacing 64bit firefox with a 32bit one?
[09:23] <paradizelost> Schalken: i would think so
[09:23] <paradizelost> you can run both types of binaries IIRC
[09:23] <Schalken> paradizelost, do you think that would work with w32codecs?
[09:23] <paradizelost> possibly
[09:23] <paradizelost> but the codecs will involve the player more than the browser
[09:23] <paradizelost> ubuntu: did it work for ya?
[09:24] <ubuntu> ok went to boot but hda3 is still showing as boot first not hda1
[09:24] <joe__> Schalken: There's a howto somewhere in the ubuntu forums about installing 32bit firefox with flash and java
[09:24] <Schalken> joe_: yeah paradizelost showed me it, thanks
[09:25] <paradizelost> ubuntu: try doing what we did earlier, just w/ the partitions unmounted
[09:25] <sflash> i dont know what i did to my synaptic, but there are no packages

[09:27] <ubuntu> ok its showing hda 1 asboot
[09:27] <ubuntu> just write it?
[09:27] <paradizelost> ubuntu: and not hda3?
[09:27] <sflash> i dont understand
[09:27] <paradizelost> ubuntu: if so, yes, then quit, and see if it gives you the error
[09:27] <kaoticorder> Does anyone know what file to modify to change the modules loaded at startup?
[09:28] <paradizelost> sflash: that sounds like your /etc/apt/sources.list is messed up
[09:28] <ubuntu> no hda3 has no flag but has a / label
[09:28] <paradizelost> kaoticorder: /etc/modules
[09:28] <sflash> i tried to install a .deb file when this happened
[09:28] <paradizelost> ubuntu: thats fine, ubuntu doesn't mount by label,
[09:28] <paradizelost> sflash: was it an ubuntu deb?
[09:28] <kaoticorder> thanks!
[09:28] <sflash> it says that there is -1 installed packages now
[09:28] <paradizelost> sflash: that sounds like a bit of an ooops
[09:28] <sflash> im not sure, i got it off of
[09:28] <paradizelost> what package?
[09:28] <sflash> http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/torrentflux
[09:28] <ubuntu> ok i write hda1?
[09:29] <paradizelost> ubuntu: yes
[09:29] <sflash> torrentflux
[09:29] <paradizelost> sflash: ok, that's a debian deb, not necessarily an ubuntu-compatible deb...
[09:29] <sflash> now am i screwed ;)
[09:29] <Obst> hi
[09:29] <sflash> will my computer detonate
[09:30] <paradizelost> sflash: and i'll be of no use even w/ a fresh mind on that one...
[09:30] <ic56> !justask
[09:30] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[09:30] <ubuntu> ok same as before wrote partirtion table but re-read table failed  reboot to update table --what about update-grub command
[09:30] <paradizelost> ic56: who was that directed to
[09:30] <sflash> how would i get my packages back in synaptic?
[09:30] <paradizelost> ubuntu: update-grub has nothing to do w/ the partitino table
[09:30] <ic56> paradizelost: Obst seemed to need encouragement.
[09:30] <ubuntu> ok
[09:31] <paradizelost> ic56: ahh.  was gonna say, he just said hi.
[09:31] <Obst> kubuntu dont want to login as root to kde, i have activated the root accound but no effect
[09:31] <paradizelost> :P
[09:31] <Obst> shell login work
[09:31] <ubuntu> so what about what i just posted
[09:31] <paradizelost> Obst: you need to edit /etc/X11/kde3/kdm/kdmrc and enable root logins
[09:31] <ic56> Obst: tell us more.
[09:31] <paradizelost> Obst: but i HIGHLY don't recommend doing it that way, and just use gksudo
[09:31] <sflash> can i reinstall synaptic you think?
[09:32] <ubuntu> paradizelost: : ok so it reboots its not updateing the tablemaybe
[09:32] <paradizelost> sflash: its an issue w/ the entire apt system on yours, but i don't know how to fix.
[09:32] <Obst> hm.. the problem: i cant change folder permisssions with kruser root mode
[09:32] <Hobbsee> Obst: use kdesu kruser
[09:32] <paradizelost> ubuntu: you were booting to the livecd right?
[09:32] <Obst> i want to set /media/ acessable to my normal user
[09:33] <paradizelost> Obst: it should already be that way
[09:33] <ubuntu> i am now yes and was before
[09:33] <paradizelost> Obst: read acess at least
[09:33] <paradizelost> ubuntu: back up your vmware virtual machines, and fresh load.... ;)
[09:34] <Obst> no i have installed the system on my hdd
[09:34] <Obst> and i want full access for my normal user
[09:34] <Obst> kdesu krusader dosent work too
[09:34] <paradizelost> Obst: to /media itself or the stuff you mount under there?
[09:34] <ubuntu> not sure how to backup vmware but will ask at vm forum
[09:34] <Obst> the stuff what i have mounted
[09:34] <paradizelost> ubuntu: copy the files to a different system
[09:34] <Obst> eg. a ext3 partition
[09:34] <ubuntu> fresh load meand what?
[09:35] <elknof1> odes anybody knows how to play a movie allocated in other serv on the network without pausing each 15 secs for buffering??
[09:35] <Obst> no drives or so..^^
[09:35] <paradizelost> ubuntu: usually stored in /var/lib/vmware/ or something
[09:35] <elknof1> im using totem
[09:35] <ubuntu> ok thanks
[09:35] <paradizelost> elknof1: copy it locally then open it
[09:35] <paradizelost> Obst: it's gonna be the permissions of the drive when you mount it
[09:35] <ubuntu> DBO: hows life?
[09:36] <Obst> root can rw all files
[09:36] <sola6662> help once more
[09:36] <paradizelost> Obst: i.e.  here's a line for my reiserfs partition thats a public area
[09:36] <paradizelost> /dev/hdb1       /media/public   reiserfs defaults        0       2
[09:36] <ic56> Obst: btw, /media is meant for removable media.  For fixed harddisks, pick a different mount point.
[09:36] <DBO> ubuntu, sleepless...  still havent got fixed huh?
[09:36] <sola6662> im booted in windows but i still cant get in my G drive
[09:36] <paradizelost> ic56: i use /media because they automatically show up on the desktop when mounted.
[09:36] <Obst> ic ok if that have any effects thx
[09:36] <Obst> *whaa*
[09:36] <paradizelost> Obst: just make sure to change reiserfs to ext3
[09:37] <elknof1> paradizelost, is the only solution??
[09:37] <sola6662> it says its unmounted when i last tried to unmount but i still cant get in
[09:37] <Obst> ok
[09:37] <ubuntu> DBO: me to  yep still trying my boss said why not go to FC5 --what why?
[09:37] <paradizelost> elknof1: not necessarily, you may have to change the buffer percentage, which i don't know howto change

[10:40] <noiesmo> I am running an rsync between two systems and everytime all the files are resent not what I expected from rsync has anyone got any idea what could be going on?
[10:40] <noiesmo> and no the files havent changed and the rsync locatations are the same
[10:40] <noiesmo> running ubuntu and debian
[10:41] <bliss_> DBO: ok try the pm please
[10:41] <DBO> bliss_, what pm?
[10:41] <bliss_> DBO: i have registed was ubuntu
[10:42] <dli> noiesmo, rsync -uv
[10:42] <Ryuujin> What's the default resolution for X on dapper drake flight 7 during install?
[10:43] <noiesmo> dli, using rysnc -rv with some excludes and includes
[10:43] <dli> noiesmo, rsync -rvu
[10:43] <asdx> hi, i configured a dhcp server on ubuntu, my client computer is windows xp, windows detects the dhcp server (on ubuntu) and it get an assigned ip address, when i ping the ubuntu machine it works, but when i ping from ubuntu to xp it dosn't, why could be that?
[10:43] <dli> noiesmo, "man rsync" for more
[10:44] <jo_e> hi, i'm getting an error when trying to update my package lists, but i'm not using the us servers
[10:44] <Ng> asdx: windows firewall?
[10:44] <Ryuujin> It'd seem that during the installation when installing X, it suddenly blanks the screen (like starting up X) and then it just diaplays two rectancles at the middle and the left edge of the screen.. Anyone would know how to solve this problem?
[10:44] <asdx> hm, could be
[10:44] <noiesmo> dli, will give it a go with the u flag
[10:44] <dli> Ryuujin, do you mean twm ?
[10:45] <Ademan> is there a way to clear out synaptic's cache? because clearly it downloaded a corrupt file
[10:45] <Healot> dapperists: #ubuntu+1
[10:45] <Ryuujin> dli: I don't know what I mean, this is my first try with ubuntu.
[10:45] <dli> Ademan, sudo apt-get clean
[10:45] <noiesmo> dli, thought if I did rsync -rv /home/blah --include="blah" --exclude="*./" user@remote it would only update whats changed but maybe the u flags the go thanks for that
[10:46] <asdx> Ng: no it dosn't work, windows xp says it has 192.168.0.5, the dhcp server assigned it, but when i put a statically ip address i can ping from ubuntu
[10:46] <Ryuujin> dli: I'm guessing it's running too high a resolution, because X works fine on freebsd.
[10:46] <jo_e> "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/breezy/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz: Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)" i get this error message
[10:46] <Ademan> thanks
[10:46] <Ng> asdx: weird
[10:46] <asdx> Ng: yeah
[10:46] <dli> Ryuujin, Ctl-Alt-F1 back to a console, login, " sudo less /var/log/Xorg.0.log "
[10:47] <Ryuujin> dli: it's during install.. and I can't press anything.
[10:47] <Ryuujin> (I'm guessing it's frozen)
[10:47] <mormoloc> im looking for something similar to Nero fo Ubuntu
[10:47] <mormoloc> any hints?
[10:47] <dli> Ryuujin, if X breaks during installation, you can reboot ( at least, other parts should work)
[10:48] <Healot> try k3b? cdrecord is sufficient enough for pros
[10:48] <dli> mormoloc, k3b
[10:48] <Healot> gnomebaker is cool too
[10:48] <Ryuujin> dli: tried rebooting, got "boot error".
[10:48] <noiesmo> dli, thanks very much that worked like a charm :)
[10:48] <asdx> Ng: wait, it dosn't work with static ip address even now
[10:48] <asdx> WTF
[10:49] <dli> noiesmo, so, try " man rsync " next time, I know it's a long man page
[10:49] <dli> Ryuujin, maybe you can install in expert mode
[10:50] <l1lk1ll> Hello everyone, I'm new - to linux and ubuntu... First things first, where can I get a better IRC client?
[10:50] <Ryuujin> dli: maybe not. I haven't been using anything except FreeBSD for.. hum.. 4 years. And I never ran linux before that.
[10:50] <l1lk1ll> I'm in the terminal
[10:50] <Ng> l1lk1ll: xchat-gnome
[10:50] <noiesmo> dli, I did look at the man, but I was under the impression that rsync only copied files that had changed and didnt see the need for update flag but doh I was wrong
[10:50] <l1lk1ll> Thanks Ng
[10:50] <Healot> l1lk1ll: by default, xchat in ubuntu is sufficient
[10:50] <l1lk1ll> Thank you Healot :)
[10:51] <dli> Ryuujin, I don't think expert mode would show much weirdness to you, except you may have to choose ext3 fs, instead of ufs, kernel is auto
[10:51] <Healot> for a start, the default installation is good
[10:52] <dli> Ryuujin, I would think " bsd n00b mode > ubuntu expert mode"
[10:52] <Ryuujin> I think I'll just go back to my trusted FreeBSD.
[10:52] <Healot> once you are thinking of customization, choose expert
[10:52] <l1lk1ll> I'm so excited about this, I still have some mud on my shoes...30 minutes ago I was in windows :-S
[10:52] <Ryuujin> dli: well, I can't say I'm a bsd newbie..
[10:52] <dli> Ryuujin, try gentoo-fbsd :)
[10:54] <Ryuujin> dli: maybe not, no.
[10:54] <Insup> does anyone know when the next release of ubuntu is?
[10:54] <Ng> Insup: 9 days or so
[10:54] <Corey> um
[10:54] <Corey> I have  problem
[10:54] <lukketto> is there a way, in KOPETE, to reduce the chat-window in the system tray?
[10:54] <Insup> hmm, wondering whether to install today or wait, is upgrading quite painless?
[10:54] <Corey> when i try to install a program it says "configure error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
[10:55] <l1lk1ll> Good question Insup, I just installed today
[10:55] <dli> Insup, install dapper, and keep it updated
[10:55] <Ng> Insup: upgrading should indeed be pretty easy, but a fresh install is always nicer imho. It's entirely up to you though. Create a separate partition for /home/ and you can install the new version next week with little or no pain :)
[10:56] <Ng> Corey: you probably need to install the build-essential package
[10:56] <Corey> hen i try to install a program it says "configure error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
[10:56] <Corey> build essential
[10:56] <l1lk1ll> Ng, You seem like the guy I need to be talking to :)
[10:56] <Corey> where is that ?
[10:56] <l1lk1ll> I'm confused, I can't even install this xchat client. :)
[10:56] <Ng> Corey: in synaptic or apt-get'able
[10:56] <dli> Corey, sudo apt-cache search build-essential
[10:56] <Ng> dli: you don't need sudo to apt-cache search :)
[10:57] <dli> Ng, I don't know :( because I always use root, while some smart asses want to keep using root as a top secret
[10:58] <noiesmo> dli, from looking at the man page if I add the --delete flag then anyfiles that the sender does not have will be removed from  the recievers system?
[10:58] <Ng> dli: they're not smart asses and it's not a top secret. It's a good idea, but this is not the place to debate  the merits of sudo
[10:59] <Corey> ok it came up with stuff
[10:59] <Corey> dli: it came up with stuff now what
[10:59] <Ng> Corey: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[10:59] <mo^> where can i find the standard xmodmap for ubuntu?
[10:59] <Corey> Ng: I did that and i have a list of stuff now what ?
[10:59] <dli> noiesmo, better test to make sure it's what you want
[11:00] <Ng> Corey: no, the command dli gave you just listed the available package, I dunno why he said that. The command I just gave you is different.
[11:00] <noiesmo> dli, ok :)
[11:00] <Corey> Ng: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:00] <Corey> oops
[11:01] <Corey> Ng: You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these:

[11:01] <Arnia> (Dapper)

[11:01] <Corey> ok

[11:03] <Corey> in snypatic it says i have a broken package
[11:03] <B1zz> sadley no i think misplaced.... :(
[11:04] <noiesmo> dli, thank you for your help the --delete cleared only what I explected ;)
[11:04] <Ng> Corey: I think it'd be a good idea to tell synaptic to reload its package lists, then quit it and do "sudo apt-get -f install" in a terminal - somehow the package system looks a bit confused
[11:04] <dli> B1zz, but why #ubuntu ?
[11:04] <B1zz> idk  i will shut up now :-p
[11:05] <Corey> ok i fixed the broekn package wich was gimp
[11:05] <Corey> cause im trying toi nstall gimpshop
[11:05] <dli> noiesmo, have a look at rsnapshot , maybe, it's something helpful to you
[11:06] <Corey> Ng: i got the build-seesential done
[11:07] <Ng> Corey: you should have a compiler installed now :)
[11:07] <noiesmo> dli, ok I will, I mainly what to sync my home folder less a couple of things to my back server so if I get sick of this install I can just run my script then blow the install away without loosing emails and any other files etc I 'll chceck out the rnapshot to.

[11:30] <ompaul> xxyyzz, rather than answering that question how about we get your printer working?
[11:31] <Senilix> xxyyzz: ubuntu ships with drivers for a lot of printers, but some won't work with linux at all. don't know if that's the case with any epson printers

[11:35] <CokeNCode> good morning, is there a linux version of googletalk?
[11:35] <Corey> uh sorry..that is what it is in terminal
[11:35] <xxyyzz> ompaul, okay, I will try that out, thanks
[11:36] <xxyyzz> Also, my computer only has 64MB of RAM, and as much as I love Ubuntu, it runs very slowly...
[11:36] <ompaul> Corey, what are you trying to install?
[11:36] <CokeNCode> hahahha
[11:36] <dli> Corey, oh, I didn't realize that
[11:36] <Senilix> CokeNCode: no, but you can use Gaim, Gajim and others
[11:36] <CokeNCode> xxyyzz, any operating system will run slow on 64 megs of ram
[11:36] <xxyyzz> A friend told me I could get a window manager that was much faster than GNOME or KDE... where would I find these, and a manual on how to install them?
[11:36] <Corey> gimpshop
[11:36] <CokeNCode> you can try just running console, and shutting down gdm
[11:36] <dli> xxyyzz, stop X :)
[11:36] <Hobbsee> !tell xxyyzz about xfce
[11:36] <zcat[1] > damn small linux will run fine in 64M of ram.. :)
[11:36] <ompaul> xxyyzz, that is a really small amount of ram, you would be be better advised to get more ram and run xubuntu-desktop
[11:37] <xxyyzz> How does xubuntu-desktop differ from Ubuntu?
[11:37] <CokeNCode> Senilix, thanks ...
[11:37] <ompaul> ohh nooo the Hobbsee is here we are all doomed or something morning Hobbsee  :-)
[11:37] <Corey> alright lets see if it works this time :)
[11:37] <Senilix> CokeNCode: how to configure gaim: http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073
[11:37] <zcat[1] > xubuntu uses xfce instead of gnome .. it's much smaller
[11:37] <xxyyzz> aaaah, k
[11:37] <xxyyzz> You guys are great - thanks :-)
[11:37] <ompaul> xxyyzz, get your printer going first
[11:37] <Hobbsee> ompaul: hehe
[11:37] <Corey> ok guys I need GTK+
[11:38] <mantice> Any one know of any good games that are windows / linux
[11:38] <dli> Corey, go to packages.ubuntu.com , search yourself
[11:38] <ompaul> Corey, question, what are you trying to compile
[11:38] <mantice> And they would run on a 700mhz / geforce4 64 mb
[11:38] <zcat[1] > mantice: what kind of games?
[11:38] <Corey> ompaul: GIMPSHOP
[11:38] <pedrocr> I installed ubuntu with software raid+LVM between two sata disks. Lilo was installed in /dev/md/0 I've done this before but this time the machine won't boot as it won't find any boot devices
[11:38] <pedrocr> anyone have any idea?
[11:39] <zcat[1] > torcs is not bad..
[11:39] <ompaul> Corey, just checking, a lot of people start to compile things that are already build
[11:39] <ompaul> Corey, s/build/built
[11:39] <DBO> ompaul, can I pm you?
[11:40] <ompaul> Hobbsee, for values of ubotu a \ needs to be escaped :-)
[11:40] <ompaul> DBO, certainly
[11:40] <Corey> ompaul: what is that directory you just sent ?
[11:40] <berkes> hello, I have an ati radeon card, and afaiks all the modules and drivers aer loaded and working correct, however, libGL is having trouble
[11:40] <berkes> it is extremely slow and stutters. libGL tells me it cannot open DRM.
[11:40] <Corey> DRM rofl
[11:40] <berkes> but lsmod shows me drm is loaded and working
[11:41] <asdx> Corey: run synaptic
[11:41] <ompaul> Corey, (A) it was not me (B) you were shown a directory that has all the packages that come with ubuntu (C) you can find these by searching in menu: System Administration Add Application
[11:41] <tubbie> any way to increase the gnome window titlebar size?
[11:41] <berkes> Corey: yes that is called drm after direct rendering machine
[11:41] <Corey> ompaul: dont worry got t isntalled :)
[11:41] <Healot> there is a workaround at ati's site and ubuntu wiki for ati fglrx drivers especially for 64bit ubuntu
[11:41] <berkes> ~manager
[11:42] <berkes> running kubuntu, so meby kdm is making this harder then it should be?
[11:42] <Corey> oops
[11:42] <Corey> i did this
[11:43] <Corey> JPEG libary failed...
[11:43] <Corey> hmm
[11:43] <Corey> libjpeg
[11:45] <Healot> faileD? details?
[11:45] <Corey> I ned a JPEG plug-in..
[11:46] <tubbie> any way to increase the gnome window titlebar size?
[11:47] <Healot> you want to compile one, or use the existing? Corey?
[11:47] <Ng> tubbie: make the titlebar font larger with System->Preferences->Fonts
[11:47] <dooglus> tubbie: you can use a different window manager theme - in system -> (something) -> themes
[11:47] <Ng> Corey: I would think you probably need to install libjpeg62-dev
[11:48] <dooglus> tubbie: or run gnome-theme-manager from the command line
[11:48] <Corey> im installing ptex-jtex
[11:49] <Corey> it will be worth the work photoshop on linux :)
[11:50] <tubbie> the theme is ok
[11:50] <tubbie> I only want to change the titlebar size
[11:50] <Ng> tubbie: make the font larger, like I said
[11:50] <tubbie> I did and it worked
[11:50] <tubbie> :)
[11:51] <Ng> :)
[11:51] <xxyyzz> Okay, I got my printer working :)
[11:51] <Healot> try GIMP, Corey, it's the mother of graphics editors on Linux
[11:51] <xxyyzz> Do I type "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" into a terminal, or a console?
[11:51] <ompaul> xxyyzz, either
[11:51] <xxyyzz> Will it automatically disable gnome?
[11:51] <dli> Corey, try, " sudo apt-get build-dep gimp ", since gimpshop is based on gimp anyway
[11:51] <xxyyzz> Or do I have to type something to turn gnome off?
[11:51] <miranda82> xxyyzz, u just choose on gdm login screen
[11:52] <Corey> yeah i have gimp installed already thoe
[11:52] <xxyyzz> miranda82, my computer doesn't ask me to login to anything... it just automatically opens gnome on startup
[11:52] <miranda82> ummm
[11:52] <ompaul> xxyyzz, until you install xubuntu it will
[11:52] <green-mouse> somebody know why 1.7Gz CPU  always work only on 600Hz? I tryd to use frequency scaling but kernel say "CPU frequency scaling not supported"... I have MSI laptop and 2.6.15 kernel insalled... any ideas?
[11:53] <miranda82> when you install a new desktop
[11:53] <miranda82> a dialog should appear
[11:53] <zcat[1] > Corey: 'build-dep' will install the things necessary for gimb to compile... that should be 99% the same things gimpshop needs..
[11:53] <xxyyzz> miranda82, and the dialog lets you choose between xubuntu and gnome?
[11:53] <miranda82> xxyyzz, yep
[11:54] <Corey> o.
[11:54] <miranda82> ompaul, correct me if not
[11:54] <xxyyzz> Oh, okay, I see how it works
[11:54] <xxyyzz> Thanks heaps :-)
[11:54] <zcat[1] > Corey: that might save you tracking down one dependency after another..
[11:54] <xxyyzz> When I install xubuntu, will I still be able to alt+f7 to go to xubuntu (same as gnome)?
[11:54] <Ng> yes
[11:54] <Subhuman> zcat[1] , what is "build-dep", ive never heard of it.
[11:54] <xxyyzz> k, thanks
[11:55] <Ng> Subhuman: man apt-get :)
[11:55] <Corey> it says couldnt find package build-dep
[11:55] <zcat[1] > apt-get install -- installs a program    apt-get build-dep  installs all the things you need to compile a program.
[11:55] <Corey> got it now
[11:55] <Subhuman> Ng, ahh :D , that could be useful, I've been stuck in dependency hell a few times building from source :D
[11:56] <Corey> i know
[11:56] <Corey> its coming up one after another
[11:56] <Corey> lol
[11:56] <Corey> said something about XGN
[11:56] <asdx> someone here configured a dhcp server on linux?
[11:56] <Corey> wish me luck compiling gimpshop once again
[11:56] <Healot> build-dep requires a deb-src repos
[11:57] <asdx> do i have to specify the gateway ip address on dhcpd.conf to let my dhcp clients know that i'm a gateway?
[11:57] <xxyyzz> "sudo apt-get install xfce4" and "xubuntu-desktop" both give me the message "Could not find package: <a>"
[11:57] <tubbie>  like the final version of the ubuntu wallpaper :)
[11:57] <xxyyzz> Where <a> is the package I try to install...
[11:57] <xxyyzz> Is there another command I should use?
[11:57] <Corey> zcat i love you
[11:57] <Corey> :D
[11:57] <Ng> asdx: yes
[11:57] <Corey> working :)
[11:58] <Corey> alright make is proccesing !
[11:58] <ubuntu> DBO; now grub menu tried all enties on hda1 did not work hda3 for other os could not boot into as they are no longer there but acording to fdisk they are
[11:58] <ompaul> miranda82, so tell me how can I communicate with you on that if your right :-)
[11:58] <miranda82> ompaul, ?
[11:58] <DBO> ubuntu, =(  so the first entry doesnt work at all?
[11:59] <DBO> ubuntu, do you know how to edit hd numbers in grub?
[11:59] <miranda82> ey DBO :) haven't noticed u!
[11:59] <Healot> (hd,0) for /dev/hd?1
[12:00] <Corey> zcat that worked so much thanks man !
[12:00] <xxyyzz> Does anybody know why "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" is saying "Could not find package"?
[12:00] <Corey> zcat[1] , thanks
[12:00] <ompaul> miranda82, you were right about the gdm thing
[12:00] <Healot> xxyyzz: update your repos first

[12:00] <Corey> xxyyzz, because its gnome
[12:00] <xxyyzz> Corey, I typed the command in a console

[12:01] <DBO> miranda82, im burned out right now... sorry, but whatever you need, the answer is probably no =/
[12:01] <ubuntu> DBO: its ohe recovery  os on hda1allk as i will delete hda3 at some point and the recovery on all hda1 gave same ouput as before
[12:01] <Corey> xxyyzz its called gnome not ubuntu desktop
[12:01] <Ng> Corey: xubuntu-desktop is a valid package, it's for something that isn't gnome
[12:01] <Corey> doing the make install now :D
[12:01] <miranda82> DBO, just saying hello to ya!!! bad boy...
[12:01] <Corey> Ng: soryr haha
[12:01] <DBO> miranda82, oh, hey

[12:01] <miranda82> DBO, 
[12:01] <CokeNCode> hey, how do i start a telnet or ftp daemon in ubunut ?
[12:01] <Corey> Ng: you know XGL ?
[12:02] <ubuntu> DBO: recovery on hda1 same output as before
[12:02] <Ng> Corey: the silly wobbly window thing?
[12:02] <Healot> CokeNCode, how about installing one first :)
[12:02] <Insup> id use openssh over telnet tbh
[12:02] <Ng> CokeNCode: are you sure you want a telnet daemon? it's not at all secure
[12:02] <Corey> Ng: yeah
[12:02] <DBO> ubuntu, nuts, you got me beat man, something is gone, but Ill be fubared before I figure out what it is... just recover data and reinstall...
[12:02] <asdx> how do i specify the dns on dhcpd.conf?
[12:02] <CokeNCode> Ng,  yeh, i know, i'm just fooling around, there's nothing on this pc
[12:02] <Ng> Corey: then no, but there is #ubuntu-xgl for people who do
[12:02] <Corey> Ng: ok
[12:02] <Healot> asdx: the fastest way , "man dhcpd.conf"
[12:02] <CokeNCode> Healot, doesn't it come installed ... weird
[12:03] <Corey> oh noes :'( make install failed !
[12:03] <Healot> CokeNCode, if you meant sshd, yes...
[12:03] <CokeNCode> oh k
[12:03] <Ng> CokeNCode: the default install is pretty minimal and doesn't install any remotely accessible services for security reasons
[12:03] <Healot> while ftpd/telnetd nay
[12:03] <CokeNCode> well, i guess i could use that for now
[12:03] <ubuntu> DBO: no i am sorry nway i will stay untill , there is more chance of the mooon interchaging with sun than me reinstalling
[12:03] <CokeNCode> Healot, how do i run sshd ?
[12:03] <Corey> Ng: can i pm you i have a big error
[12:03] <Ng> Healot: sshd is not installed by default

[12:08] <Healot> how do I break a mirror
[12:08] <Ng> Corey: before you ran "make" you should have run "./configure" - just do that again with "--disable-mmx" after it
[12:08] <Corey> Ng: ./configure --prefix=/usr    <-- that is what i was using
[12:09] <CokeNCode> anyone else getting alot of errors with apt-get recently ?

[12:09] <Bilford> how is Linux different from Windows as far as the underlying system goes
=== Sola_Kusanagi is now known as sola6662
[12:10] <Ng> Bilford: completely :)
[12:10] <njan> Bilford, they're completely different OSs.
[12:10] <Corey> Ng: because i got up to make install
[12:10] <njan> Bilford, the kernels are fundamentally different.
[12:10] <Bilford> is Windows more integrated with everything?
[12:10] <njan> Bilford, different kernel designs, different lineage, different design philosophies..
[12:10] <Corey> Ng: using the command i had before i got up to make install and it nearly worked..
[12:11] <njan> Bilford, windows is designed different and it's a proprietary OS. Some things are more integrated, some aren't, it's not quite that simple.
[12:11] <mjr> Bilford, that question is nonsensical

[12:11] <Bilford> well, Windows has a registry
[12:11] <Bilford> I dont have to
[12:11] <Bilford> I already switched all my computers over to Dapper
[12:12] <sangenfant> Julin: what's up?
[12:12] <Bilford> I dont know how to phrase my question better

[12:12] <Julin> sang. hi got some prob on how to install a .jar file.
[12:12] <Corey> yeah thats what im dong now
[12:12] <Corey> what does that do anyway ?
[12:12] <Julin> u think u could help?
[12:13] <sangenfant> julin: that's a java archive file
[12:13] <Bilford> to me Windows seems like it's totally controlling and integrating, while Linux is more like a freeform structure shell
[12:13] <Julin> yes. I'm trying to install javadc...
[12:13] <Bilford> if that makes any sense
[12:13] <ndlovu> anyone managed burning a dvd over the network with ubunt?
[12:13] <Bilford> oh well nm
[12:13] <Corey> dli: howd oes that help /
[12:13] <sangenfant> julin: have you tried 'fastjar -x myjarfile.jar'?
[12:14] <Insup> well, does windows have any control of what/who modifies the registry and config files?
[12:14] <Ng> of course
[12:14] <Julin> sangefant: no but i will ;) new to linux...

[12:14] <munzir_> Hi, any one managed to let this xfishtank works? It gives nothing here!
[12:14] <sangenfant> Julin: It may not be there, I had to install the javavm for linux and it may have come with that package
[12:14] <ranpha> HI, when you connect to a network server with the internal gnome function..it always uses a nobody:nogroup ID..can you change this?
[12:15] <Ng> munzir_: afaik xfishtank draws onto the root window (ie the desktop), but nautilus will be displaying the gnome background on top of that
[12:15] <ubuntu> is there a cluster manager in ubuntu command line?
[12:15] <Julin> sangenfant oh. ok. I'm trying now..
[12:17] <slackern> Ubugtu: cman - cluster manager perhaps?

[12:36] <p3t3r> gedit /etc/apt/source.list
[12:36] <ompaul> dli, as I said noted
[12:36] <Schalken> can anyone see a privacy policy regarding the personal information required to have Ubuntu CDs shipped?

[12:36] <Corey> just taking a long time
[12:36] <Corey> its like streaming through paragraphs of code lol
[12:36] <tubbie> Schalken, why not just download the iso?
[12:36] <l1lk1ll> Anyone feel like helping a new user install xchat?

[12:37] <l1lk1ll> The problem is I'm completely new to linux, and I have no idea what I'm doing :D

[12:37] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, do u know what a terminal is?
[12:37] <l1lk1ll> Yes, that's how I got here
[12:38] <l1lk1ll> typing irc in terminal
[12:38] <CokeNCode> what's the "us." ?
[12:38] <tubbie> u can issue the comand sudo apt-get install xchat
[12:38] <Corey> ./configure --prefix=/usr --xxm
[12:38] <Schalken> tubbie: also because i want to give x86 versions to my friends and i have x86_64, so i would have to download 2 isos

[12:38] <tubbie> Schalken, I c feel sorry for you
[12:38] <l1lk1ll> no package named xchat
[12:38] <dli> Corey, --disable-mmx
[12:39] <slackern> CokeNCode: right now i run withou se. though.
[12:39] <CokeNCode> ok, can you paste me a copy of your sources.list file ? or something like that ?
[12:39] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, you have to eneble the repo first
[12:39] <l1lk1ll> What tubbie? heh
[12:39] <CokeNCode> or send it to me over irc ?
[12:39] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, are you in a GUI?
[12:39] <l1lk1ll> My typing fingers are at your command, sir.  Yes I'm in UbuntuDappo
[12:39] <l1lk1ll> Er, Dapper
[12:39] <tubbie> CokeNCode, mine use the us servers too
[12:39] <slackern> CokeNCode: sure but beware that im running dapper and not breezy
[12:39] <krio> How much Ram does xubuntu 6.06 require ?
[12:39] <sangenfant> dli: installing the package? Because dpkg --status shows status 'install ok installed'
[12:40] <CokeNCode> oh .. ok
[12:40] <p3t3r> Hi codeNcode,u cat get a source.list from here :  http://apt.ubuntu.org.tw
[12:40] <sangenfant> dli: the one thing I know is that the fonts.alias file is missing from the misc directory
[12:40] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, system -. administration -> synaptic package manager
[12:40] <Healot> krio: a lightweight desktop usually needs 64MB... or more, are you tryign tu run xubuntu on some old pc?
[12:40] <dli> sangenfant, I think X should start as far as xfonts-base is installed
[12:40] <CokeNCode> oops, i'm using breezy
[12:40] <slackern> CokeNCode: and that might break stuff for if you choose to use it as it is, i have universe and multiverse enabled also.
[12:40] <Doctorconfucius> Hey I've installed Auctex using synaptic, but can't seem to find it anywahere

[12:41] <dli> sangenfant, it's not really a good practice, but I like my n00b way, "apt-get -f remove xfonts-base", and reinstall X again

[12:41] <w-mute> Hey, folks. I have problems connecting to a WPA WLAN AP by Network Manager. Anybody into this?
[12:42] <l1lk1ll> Tubbie I found xchat-gnome on this list
[12:42] <tubbie> !tell l1lk1ll  sources
[12:42] <sangenfant> dli: Well, bad part about that is I think I've done that a couple times already
[12:42] <l1lk1ll> should I check box it?
[12:42] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, yep
[12:42] <tubbie> and then apply
[12:42] <dli> sangenfant, my way? or your way?
[12:42] <krio> Healot: i'm going to install xubuntu 6.06 on a notebook ( 350mhz, 64Mb RAM, HD 3Gb)...i'd like to know if it will work...
[12:42] <l1lk1ll> This is all so easy :)
[12:43] <tubbie> yes it is :)
[12:43] <dli> sangenfant, then, sit back, double check your sources.list first, easysource, maybe
[12:43] <l1lk1ll> I really love this so far, this is the first time I've been brave enough to go with linux
[12:43] <w-mute> krio: Breezy did work on such a low-end machine.
[12:43] <l1lk1ll> is with ubuntu
[12:43] <krio> tnx a lot
[12:43] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, feel free to ask your questions here :)
[12:43] <krio> i will try
[12:43] <w-mute> krio good luck.
[12:43] <sangenfant> dli: your way.
[12:43] <l1lk1ll> I'll be right back on xchat - I hope
[12:44] <krio> i thik i'll be back here soon :D
[12:44] <l1lk1ll> :D
[12:44] <l1lk1ll> back to civilization!
[12:44] <dli> sangenfant, and now ? pastebin.com the fatal error in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[12:44] <ScarecroWork> Hi. I have installed Mono and the mono_mod installed for Apache2 .. but when I try and view the aspx file in the browser I just tries to download it (I use the Ubuntu Dapper Drake Beta)

[12:44] <PuGz> hey guys... i am trying to get my DLINK wireless PCI card to work in ubuntu dapper. it shows up as interface wlan0 with description ACX... I have tried configuring the device with iwconfig and then using dhclient to get an ip... but it wont work. can anyone offer their help?
[12:45] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, u might want to read this to. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats

[12:46] <l1lk1ll> Here is another simple question , tubbie, I was trying to install a plugin for firefox, but I didn't know where it was.
[12:46] <dli> PuGz, what's the error message? maybe, pastebin.com iwconfig output

[12:46] <l1lk1ll> flash player 7
[12:46] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, just go to a site with flash
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> Idownloaded it, and can run it from terminal
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> but then it asks for firefox directory
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> and that's where I get lost
[12:47] <tubbie> wait, l1lk1ll read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> I can't find it
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> ok, reading now
[12:47] <tubbie> on that page, there is a howto install flash
[12:47] <l1lk1ll> for dapper?
[12:47] <sangenfant> l1lk1ll: You try a 'locate firfox' from shell?
[12:47] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, are u o dapper?
[12:48] <sangenfant> s/firfox/firefox
[12:48] <l1lk1ll> yes
[12:48] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, then do the steps for dapper ;)
[12:48] <l1lk1ll> thanks, sorry if I ask easy questions at first
[12:48] <l1lk1ll> I learn fast I promise
[12:48] <Healot> l1lk1ll: good
[12:48] <dli> sangenfant, I said , " apt-get -f remove xfonts-base "
[12:49] <dli> sangenfant, since you have messed up, try, " apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg " also
[12:49] <guerra> hail all, im looking for a simple term to use with fluxbox with transparency available, what do u recomend?
[12:49] <ScarecroWork> Anyone got any idea why my mono_mod for apache2 doesn't work? (it wants to download the aspx file instead of showing it)
[12:49] <dli> sangenfant, it's much easier to get a fresh restart now
[12:49] <l1lk1ll> oh wow so the only way to run flash is with windows?
[12:50] <dli> sangenfant, again, this is a rather silly approach, but works for me most of time
[12:50] <guerra> im usint aterm, do u know any better?
[12:50] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, nope

[12:51] <l1lk1ll> oh ok I read the wrong section, sorry again :)
[12:51] <l1lk1ll> I hate being new :D
[12:51] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, the repo is where you get all the osftware from suing apt-get/synaptic package manager
[12:51] <l1lk1ll> thanks :D
[12:51] <dli> l1lk1ll,  easysource works great for n00bs
[12:52] <sangenfant> dli: now just do an 'apt-get install xfonts-base'?
[12:52] <Corey> this is still making !
[12:52] <barrigatenplatea> hi
[12:52] <barrigatenplatea> alguien habla espaol
[12:52] <dli> sangenfant, no, " apt-get install ubuntu-desktop "
[12:52] <dli> sangenfant, the simple idea is to remove from the bottom and to install from the top, thanks to apt
[12:53] <l1lk1ll> This is funny, the site is saying that flash support only for AMD64 and PPC when I installed the non-AMD64 for the specific reason that my friend said AMD64 version couldnt do flash :)
[12:53] <macsim> hi, I'm unable to restaure my thunderbird mail form my backup anybody got a link about this ?
[12:53] <barrigatenplatea> you know how i can to put in red mac osx and 1 pc with ubuntu, the SO in my mac os x is 10.3.9
[12:54] <barrigatenplatea> thanks
[12:54] <MiniJames> how did you backup?
[12:54] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, that's right. flash on Ubuntu amd64 is very buggy
[12:54] <tubbie> but you can still use Ubuntu 32bit
[12:55] <Corey> it is installiing !
[12:55] <munzir_> Ng: I was disconnected before I can reply to your answer. I am not using nautilus since  I am booting in kde
[12:56] <PuGz> dli: there is no error message as such - the device appears to work... but doesnt actually work... if you know what i mean? iwconfig: http://pastebin.com/734828
[12:56] <dli> Corey, just carious, does gimpshop provide debian/rules ? scripts to build .deb
[12:57] <Spoc> heyas
[12:57] <Spoc> hmm support channel.. woops
[12:58] <CrippsFX> has anyone here ever had sound problems after a kernel upgrade?
[12:58] <Ng> munzir_: then whatever it is that draws KDE's desktop is on top of the fishtank
[12:58] <PuGz> dli: it is a DLINK wireless PCI card that uses the ACX 111 driver
[12:58] <dli> PuGz, can you " iwlist scan " ?
[12:58] <munzir_> Ng: so how can I disable it?
[12:58] <rencrash> i have a printer installed on a xp pc on the network and want to print to in from my ubuntu xwin

[01:00] <barrigatenplatea> the mac say me
[01:00] <dli> PuGz, the driver is in kernel, right?
[01:00] <PuGz> dli: yes... acx drivier
[01:00] <nataes> irc.pl
[01:01] <PuGz> dli: and it is loaded

[01:01] <siccness> Has anyone managed to get fglrx to work in Ubuntu?
[01:01] <dli> barrigatenplatea, be more specific ?
[01:02] <dli> !tell siccness about ait
[01:02] <Hexidigital> they should incorporate the bcm43xx-fwcutter into the EdgyEft release....
[01:02] <dli> !tell siccness about ati
[01:02] <PuGz> dli: there are a bunch of messages saying "firmware version=default" and "firmware 2.3.1.31 does not work well with this driver"
[01:02] <siccness> Pointless, dli, seem all of them and still can't get it to work
[01:02] <siccness> Ahh well, thanks anyway
[01:02] <l1lk1ll> I have flash :D
[01:02] <dli> PuGz, haha, then, I suggest you to try another version of kernel/firmware
[01:03] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, :)
[01:03] <l1lk1ll> tubbie, this link is awesome.
[01:03] <pedrocr> is the amd64 port fully 64 bits or will 32 bit applications run as well?
[01:03] <dli> PuGz, you can simply download firmwares to /lib/firmware/
[01:03] <PuGz> dli: yeah... a kernel upgrade might do it
[01:03] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, yes it is. you might want to do the mp3 steps too ;)
[01:03] <PuGz> dli: sweet... there are a bunch of acx firmwares at that location
[01:03] <dli> PuGz, don't forget the firmware, that's why I really hate all binary drivers
[01:04] <MyNameIsNotBob> j
[01:04] <PuGz> dli: cool... cheers for that... can i use the firmware off my dlink install cd? i think i can...?
[01:04] <l1lk1ll> Tubbie, my friend told me using linux was not practical.   I told him that with ubuntu it isn't.
[01:04] <l1lk1ll> He challanged me to use it for a month as my main OS
[01:05] <l1lk1ll> so, I am going to try :)
[01:05] <dli> PuGz, just try it, also, get updates from acx100.sf.net
[01:05] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, if you'r not a gamer, you will like it!
[01:05] <l1lk1ll> er - that with ubuntu it is.
[01:05] <PuGz> dli: yeah... its just all very difficult seeing as i am not connected to the network on that computer!
[01:05] <l1lk1ll> I am a gamer I had to make that exception, I said I'd only switch to windows for gaming heh
[01:05] <PuGz> dli: might have to use cdrw i think
[01:05] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, what viden card do you have?
[01:05] <l1lk1ll> 6800GT
[01:05] <tubbie> video*
[01:05] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, awosme!
[01:05] <dli> l1lk1ll, you can run your ubuntu desktop for one month without a reboot :)
[01:05] <tubbie> mine is fx5200 :)
[01:06] <l1lk1ll> a64 3500+ 3gb DDR
[01:06] <ollo82> how can i resize the apt cache?
[01:06] <l1lk1ll> er 2gb**
[01:06] <dli> PuGz, I see, catch 22
[01:06] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, u also might want to try Xgl if you like desktop eye candy
[01:06] <dli> PuGz, get a usb-stick
[01:06] <l1lk1ll> I LOVE desktop eye candy
[01:07] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, try out Xgl ;)
[01:07] <PuGz> dli: ahh... i didnt even think of that! hehe - i will use my ipod!
[01:07] <l1lk1ll> I will, I'm so excited :D
[01:07] <l1lk1ll> is it hard to setup?
[01:07] <dli> l1lk1ll, yes, windows vista is still a long way, but you cat get Xgl with ubuntu now
[01:07] <l1lk1ll> I'm not even that hyped with vista anymore
[01:07] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, not really. first make sure you have a working driver for your gfx card
[01:07] <PuGz> dli: silly me :)
[01:08] <dli> l1lk1ll, don't try it :( it's for alpha testing only
[01:08] <l1lk1ll> yes, I did an apt-get nvidia glsomething
[01:08] <ollo82> no ideas about resizing apt cache?
[01:08] <l1lk1ll> I had my other friend walk me through increasing my resolution - it was so complicated
[01:08] <dli> ollo82, why do you want to resize it?
[01:08] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, do glxinfo | head
[01:09] <MiniJames> screen res is easy
[01:09] <MiniJames> :)
[01:09] <MiniJames> system > preferences > screen resolution
[01:09] <ollo82> because i use apt-cacher on this machine, and there is no need to have the packages twice
[01:09] <munzir_> Ng: np thanks anyway
[01:09] <MiniJames> oh lol
[01:09] <MiniJames> misread
[01:09] <dli> l1lk1ll, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg , but you can do System -> Preferences -> Screen resolution , in the gnome menu
[01:10] <l1lk1ll> I did dli but the resolution I wanted wasn't there
[01:10] <barrigatenplatea> i put the adress ssh of my mac in to contec with servidor (in Places) but isn detected at i cant open the archives
[01:10] <MiniJames> i had this problem
[01:10] <l1lk1ll> so he made me edit all this stuff in xorg or something :-s
[01:10] <l1lk1ll> and then it was there
[01:10] <MiniJames> external screen to laptop?
[01:10] <_ClouD_> hello i need a client for msn messenger? what's the better?
[01:10] <MiniJames> make sure the screen is plugged in before boot
[01:10] <MiniJames> gaim is the best msn client
[01:10] <dli> OlliK, then, "apt-get clean " , maybe, autoclean
[01:10] <MiniJames> if not use amsn
[01:10] <l1lk1ll> Tubbie did you get my /msg ?
[01:10] <sangenfant> dli: It didn't work!
[01:10] <tubbie> nope
[01:11] <MiniJames> msn messenger: amsn / gaim

[01:21] <dli> johannes__, not sure about converting, I know mencoder can convert everything, but it's for movie mostly
[01:21] <jpotex> and what if that doesn't work?
[01:21] <jpotex> i'm running ubuntu breezy through vmplayer right now
[01:21] <DBO> jpotex, well then you have to compile a kernel
[01:21] <DBO> !compilekernel
[01:21] <ubotu> You will probably find info about this at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto
[01:21] <Hexidigital> is it possible to view .chm files in ubuntu?
[01:21] <DBO> !chm
[01:21] <ubotu> DBO: NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[01:21] <DBO> Hexidigital, yes
[01:22] <Corey> guys i just installed gimpshop..and its the same as gimp..
[01:22] <kahuuna> hello, can anyone help me with multimonitor setup using driver fglrx, but not dualhead?
[01:22] <Corey> is there some weird directory ?
[01:22] <rencrash> is samba client installed on ubuntu as default?
[01:22] <Hexidigital> DBO: do i need to install restricted drivers or such/
[01:22] <jpotex> DBO: and I can do that and then use it in the installation program?
[01:22] <PuGz> dli: i upgraded to a 686 kernel (the latest one) and the restricted drivers as well... no such luck... still doesnt work
[01:23] <DBO> Hexidigital, google chm linux, there are plenty of progs to do that
[01:23] <Hexidigital> thanks DBO
[01:23] <DBO> jpotex, not really no...  you would have to get relaly tricky on your install, see if dapper drake can help you
[01:23] <dli> PuGz, dapper kernel /firmware?
[01:23] <jpotex> DBO: ok, because having support in the installation is the only way as it seems.
[01:24] <PuGz> dli: what are you saying sorry? i am using the firmware that comes with the dapper kernel if thats what you mean
[01:24] <johannes__> dli i want to put it on the ipod nano but gtkpod doesnt include this wma->mp3 feature like the apple itunes software. anyway thx
[01:24] <Healot> Hexidigital: you can decompile that compiled HTML help first
[01:24] <rencrash> is samba client installed on ubuntu as default?
[01:24] <DBO> jpotex, yes, if you want to install to that drive directly
[01:24] <jpotex> DBO: which is what I want, hm
[01:24] <DBO> rencrash, yes
[01:24] <Hexidigital> Healot: using, like, bluefish or something?
[01:24] <rencrash> thanks DBO
[01:25] <jpotex> DBO: However, I'll try Dapper and hope it works
[01:25] <jpotex> Thanks
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[01:26] <dli> johannes__, try the package, bladeenc
[01:27] <dli> PuGz, let me have a look at the newest vanilla kernel
[01:27] <kahuuna> Can anyone help me with multimonitor setup using driver fglrx, but not dualhead, as in MergedFB for 3d purposes?
[01:27] <Healot> kahuuna, installed the fglrx-control package yet?
[01:28] <kahuuna> Healot, yes
[01:28] <rencrash> in which directory is samba
[01:28] <kahuuna> how can I access fglrx-control options?
[01:28] <kahuuna> just updated the package with upgrade in fact
[01:29] <PuGz> dli: what do you mean? u gonna check out whether it should work?
[01:29] <dli> PuGz, acx100 is not in stable kernel :(
[01:30] <Corey> guys i just installed gimpshop and its exactly the same as gimp
[01:30] <Corey> is there something i need to do ?
[01:30] <PuGz> dli: yeah i know... its not been accepted yet... but it is in the resitricted drivers package
[01:30] <dli> Corey, don't repeat :( heard
[01:31] <kahuuna> Can anyone help me with multimonitor setup using driver fglrx, but not dualhead, as in MergedFB for 3d purposes?
[01:31] <lobstu> hi all .. i've just configured svn on ubuntu (went fine) and then configured svn+ssh. that went not so fine .. something i did caused my non-root user to lose sudo privileges (user can not use /bin/bash as root), and when i authenticate with svn, i have to enter the password 3 times .. every time
[01:31] <lobstu> can anyone help me?
[01:31] <Corey> dli: sorry i went away what was said ?
[01:31] <rencrash> where can i find samba?
[01:31] <lobstu> i can provide a list of the commands i entered to configure svnssh
[01:31] <lobstu> rencrash : type 'which samba'
[01:32] <dli> PuGz, hard time then :( you may have to read bugs/mailing list at acx100.sf.net
[01:32] <PuGz> ok
[01:32] <Corey> dli: it starts up and has the gimpshop logo but then its the same as gimp... and its clearly not the same on the website
[01:32] <rencrash> lobstu, samba is installed as default on a ubuntu installation how do you find it to use it then?
[01:33] <dli> Corey, I suppose nobody cares much about gimpshop, or even gimp, I remember #debian people say, "nobody uses gimp, even the gimp developers"
[01:33] <kahuuna> Can anyone help me with multimonitor setup using driver fglrx for MergedFB (not dualhead) for 3d purposes?
[01:33] <kahuuna> I hate that ati's linux support is so poor
[01:33] <kahuuna> my god.
[01:33] <lobstu> rencrash, i know that one executes '/etc/init.d/samba restart' to restart the service, and that the config files are in /etc/samba/
[01:33] <Corey> dli: GIMPSHOP is an almost replica of photoshop
[01:33] <lobstu> that should get you started
[01:33] <Corey> dli: http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294
[01:33] <dli> kahuuna, fsf.org recommends intel video cards
[01:34] <lobstu> otherwise, if you want GUI, it's represented as Shared Folders in administration
[01:34] <Corey> dli: ill be back in a minute dont say anything i need to hear yet please
[01:34] <kahuuna> dli, not an option to use other cards
[01:34] <kahuuna> dli, I'm using 2xati,1xmatrox atm
[01:35] <dli> kahuuna, intel cards have fully GPLed drivers for linux
[01:35] <kahuuna> dli, yes but I'm not going out and buying another video card
[01:35] <kahuuna> it's not a solution to the problem
[01:36] <dli> kahuuna, I don't even think you could, because intel cards are indeed integrated (on-board)
[01:36] <kahuuna> plus I wouldn't be able to play with xgl/compiz :D
[01:37] <dli> kahuuna, if you check how many questions about nvidia/ati drivers asked here, you understand why intel cards are valued
[01:37] <saquib> >> Can anyone Suggest a few fun/action filled gamed on OpenGL available for FREE? Will be better if available through Synaptic !!!
[01:37] <kahuuna> dli, and?! they don't offer good enough 3d support - therefore I don't value them
[01:38] <dli> kahuuna, intel cards support Xgl, and should continue being so, because of GPLed drivers
[01:38] <kahuuna> yea but not good enough performance for my tastes - why you trying to convert me to intel anyway? lol :D
[01:38] <gholen> can I remove OO.org, without having to remove ubuntu-desktop?
[01:39] <Corey> dli: im back
[01:39] <dli> saquib, flightgears
[01:39] <Corey> has anyone used gimpshop !?
[01:39] <dli> gholen, should be okay to go ahead
[01:40] <saquib> dli, thanks.... and any FPS???
[01:40] <kahuuna> Can anyone help me with multimonitor setup using driver fglrx for MergedFB (not dualhead) for 3d purposes?
[01:40] <dli> saquib, what fps ?
[01:40] <Corey> what is a very good program like photoshop ?
[01:40] <saquib> dli, something like quake 2 or something
[01:41] <selinium> Corey: GIMP
[01:41] <gholen> when I am in synaptic, it tells me that ubuntu-desktop will be removed as well, thats why I'm asking.
[01:41] <dli> saquib, I don't know :( you may try googling " linux games "

[01:56] <l1lk1ll> tubbue :D
[01:56] <l1lk1ll> can't msg you on that name
[01:58] <bwbettin> Is it a bad idea to use Aptitude and Synaptic to install/remove packages.  I had read a while back (year?) in some Debian docs that mixing the two could break your system.  I just switched to Ubuntu, and was curious if this was a problem or if I could freely switch between the two depending no whether or not I'm in X?

(i *could* afford to get another card... but i cant justify spending that money if this one is working! i like the idea of supporting the better manufacturers for linux... but i just cant right now)

[02:10] <dli> saquib, I suppose so, you can write a script to do import, but that's nothing but stupid, there should be a way
[02:12] <saquib> dli... hehe, ok. cmon im just a newbie. i was wjust wondering, so i could show some fancy linux stuffs to my frnds.

[02:31] <JoaoJoao> hello
[02:31] <fulldisclosure> hi
[02:31] <momozone> I am installing asterisk on ubuntu but i need the following packages bison libncurses-dev and libssl-dev but apt-get can not find them
[02:31] <H080J03> i feel like god looking at a ntfs file system on linux
[02:31] <JoaoJoao> is there a minimal "server" installation CD somewhere?
[02:31] <fulldisclosure> my ubuntu dapper gets frozen if I try to start X with nvidia driver
[02:31] <ompaul> rencrash, thats system administration printing
[02:31] <babo> linux_galore, neither of them seem to handle .gif files very well. It's a shame that gimp doesn't do diagrams .... :-(
[02:31] <fulldisclosure> screen gets frozen, somebody know the problem?
[02:32] <JoaoJoao> fulldisclosure: I usually freeze screen doing Ctrl+S
[02:32] <henry54> House_MD: Asus A8V deluxe here...
[02:32] <linux_galore> babo: kivio does gif
=== tuxinafedora is now known as tuxtheslacker
[02:32] <momozone> can anyone help
[02:32] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[02:32] <babo> linux_galore: how do I get kivio ?
[02:32] <rencrash> ompaul,  sorry?
[02:32] <fulldisclosure> JoaoJoao: here if I try to start X with nvidia driver screeen gets frozen
[02:33] <fulldisclosure> :/
[02:33] <tuxtheslacker> I'm officially in the process of joining your ranks :-)
[02:33] <tuxtheslacker> let's hope this works :-D
[02:33] <tuxtheslacker> btw, what driver will ubuntu use out of the box for an ATI card?
[02:33] <ompaul> rencrash, thats system administration printing you were asking the bot about printing
[02:33] <linux_galore> babo: apt-get install kivio
[02:33] <RichiH> ompaul: oi
[02:33] <RichiH> ompaul: how are you?
[02:33] <johannes__> i want to open a photo file
[02:34] <ompaul> JoaoJoao, there is a server cd check it out in the release
[02:34] <johannes__> by default it uses kwickshoe but it takes so long for loading
[02:34] <rencrash> ompaul, i just want to get to print on a officejet 6213 hp
[02:34] <babo> linux_galore: makes sense I guess ... :-)
[02:34] <ompaul> RichiH, learning more and more about less and less, eventually I will know everything about nothing :)
[02:34] <JoaoJoao> is it a bad idea to put ubuntu sources in my newly installed minimal debian stable system
[02:34] <johannes__> how can i make kwickshow faster or change to a faster program
[02:34] <rencrash> but the problem is the officejet 6213 hp is on a windows pc
[02:34] <DBO> JoaoJoao, only if you want it to stay stable
[02:35] <RichiH> heh
[02:35] <johannes__> dli sry i havent tried out yet
[02:35] <ompaul> rencrash, then you want to print from a samba client, and that I have no idea about
[02:35] <johannes__> dli but i will report as soon i know more
[02:35] <zizie> question : what is the best control panel like webmin... ( i mean i need the free one except webmin ... ) if there is an option i prefer the packaged that i can install using apt-get install
[02:35] <abimanyu> ubuntu fools try some nice distors and leave ubuntu
[02:35] <linux_galore> babo: http://www.thekompany.com/projects/kivio/
[02:35] <JoaoJoao> DBO: heh I got shocked when I realized debian stable *still* uses kernel 2.4
[02:36] <rencrash> ompaul,  no print for anything in xwindows
[02:36] <DBO> JoaoJoao, thats because debian releases on a geological time cycle, but it is quite stable and secure
[02:36] <Lunarctic> hola
[02:36] <Lunarctic> what's the sound driver directory in ubuntu?
[02:36] <JoaoJoao> DBO: So, using ubuntu sources won't hurt me right?
[02:36] <dou213> how can i see the model of my vireo card? and the CPU architecture of the machine?
[02:37] <zizie> hello
[02:37] <Ng> dou213: /var/log/Xorg.0.log should contain video card information (along with lots of other stuff, it's a fairly big log usually) and the CPU information is in /proc/cpuinfo
[02:37] <eggzeck> dou213, lspci
[02:38] <henry54> linux_galore: kivio is pretty cool, just tried it for the first time, thanks!
[02:38] <zizie> question : what is the best control panel like webmin... ( i mean i need the free one except webmin ... ) if there is an option i prefer the packaged that i can install using apt-get install
[02:38] <DBO> JoaoJoao, if you want to use ubuntu sources, install ubuntu
[02:38] <DBO> JoaoJoao, otherwise do not use those sources, you will fubar stuff
[02:38] <Ng> zizie: I've yet to see one that isn't horrible ;)
[02:38] <babo> ok, so my command line can't connect to my x server. I think I might have unset the display variable ... what should I set display to, in order to get it to work ... ?
[02:38] <zizie> :((
[02:38] <ompaul> DBO, find unusable beyond all recognition
[02:38] <henry54> linux_galore: can you get stencils for network diagrams as well? e.g. router symbol, firewall, server etc.?
[02:38] <zizie> except cpanel for sure
[02:38] <zizie> lolz
[02:39] <zizie> Ng : is zope is good enough ?
[02:39] <DBO> ompaul, yeah, lets go with that
[02:39] <babo> henry54: are there any 'people' in there ... ?
[02:39] <Ng> zizie: zope isn't a control panel, it's more like a web application framework
[02:39] <Ng> babo: export DISPLAY=:0.0
[02:39] <henry54> babo: people? where?
[02:39] <babo> henry54: thought bubbles would be nice as well ... I guess thats hoping for too much ...
[02:39] <babo> in kivio ...
[02:39] <zizie> Ng : so what is your suggest the best of the worse ?
[02:40] <dou213> eggzeck, i did lspci, where can i see the CPU architecture? i'm on a laptop
[02:40] <tuxtheslacker> hey guys, cross your fingers on this one :-P
[02:40] <henry54> babo oh, the stencils.... yep, pretty basic from what I can see...
[02:40] <eggzeck> dou213, then do this: cat /proc/cpucinfo
[02:40] <babo> Ng: now I'm getting ... Xlib: No protocol specified
[02:40] <babo>   ?
[02:40] <Ng> zizie: my honest suggestion would be not to use one - you will learn a lot more if you do things by hand
[02:40] <JoaoJoao> oh well I'll use debian testing then
[02:41] <babo> henry54: ah well ...
[02:41] <henry54> babo: well, I just installed it seconds ago.. have no clue if other stencils can be imported.
[02:41] <Ng> JoaoJoao: don't run testing
=== rapha_ is now known as rapha
[02:41] <JoaoJoao> why not?
[02:41] <zizie> Ng : yes that correct but in bad situation this box will use by other person :((
[02:41] <babo> henry54: I'm surprised that gimp doesn't have a plugin for this ....
[02:41] <Ng> JoaoJoao: because it can be broken for significantly longer than unstable
[02:41] <DBO> JoaoJoao, running anything but a stable release on a server is a genuinely bad idea
[02:41] <babo> Does anyone know what Xlib: No protocol specified
[02:41] <babo>  ... means in relation to connecting to the xserver and being refused ... ?
[02:41] <henry54> babo: hmm, gimp has a different concept.
[02:42] <dou213> hmm, yes my CPU is Pentium 4, but how can i see if it's with Hyper-Threading or without?
[02:42] <JoaoJoao> never had serious issues with testing myself
[02:42] <Ng> dou213: check /proc/cpuinfo in the flags section for "ht"
[02:42] <linux_galore> henry54: not sure, I use it mainly for project line charts nothing fancy
[02:43] <dou213> Ng, i did "cat /proc/cpuinfo
[02:43] <JoaoJoao> But I'd rather use Ubuntu, but I need a server ISO
[02:43] <DBO> JoaoJoao, the regular ISO has a server install
[02:43] <Ng> JoaoJoao: if a package is broken in testing and a new version is uploaded to unstable, there is a period of time it *has* to wait before it can get into testing. if another version is uploaded within that time it resets and starts again. Keep doing that and you can go weeks/months without a new version making it into testing.
[02:43] <henry54> linux_galore: hmm, ok.
[02:43] <eggzeck> dou213, then check what he said under FLAGS man
[02:43] <dou213> and there is ht
[02:43] <Ng> dou213: then I would say that your CPU supports hyperthreading
[02:43] <JoaoJoao> yup, but then it takes much longer to d/l here
[02:43] <dou213> ok thx
[02:44] <linux_galore> henry54: aah looks like you can buy them -> http://www.thekompany.com/products/kivio/stencils.php3
[02:44] <linux_galore> henry54: seems to be his income stream are the templates
[02:45] <Ng> JoaoJoao: you could do an install with debootstrap or similar
[02:46] <LOLDIKKY> hi what is the mplayer codec dir on ubuntu???
[02:46] <bluetooth_azimut> hi
[02:46] <babo> linux_galore, Kivio asks me wether I want to open an xml doc or a kivio doc, it doens't recognize anything else ...
[02:47] <dou213> hmm... how can i see exactly the model of my video card? i did "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log", but it returns a lot of ATI video card models
[02:47] <bluetooth_azimut> anybody well-experienced with ubuntu here?
[02:47] <RandolphCarter> dou213: lspci -vv | less
[02:47] <bung> bluetooth_azimut: I very much doubt it.
[02:47] <linux_galore> babo: you print the image to file, once you have done that you have a postcript file you can make into anything
[02:48] <DBO> bluetooth_azimut, we try not to be, slows up the work, but ask anyhow =)
[02:48] <gnomefreak> bluetooth_azimut: just state your problem/ask your question and someone in here will attempt to help
[02:48] <bluetooth_azimut> my friend got problem
[02:48] <ompaul> LOLDIKKY, look in /usr/lib/codecs/
[02:48] <bluetooth_azimut> X server doesn't start on his PC
[02:48] <bluetooth_azimut> he gor 64-bit AMD CPU
[02:48] <DBO> bluetooth_azimut, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:48] <ompaul> bluetooth_azimut, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[02:49] <DBO> jinx
[02:49] <Skye_> anyone knows how to adjust screen brightness/contrast/gama in gnome?
[02:49] <gnomefreak> bluetooth_azimut: depending on the type of card will depend on if he needs driverse for it
[02:49] <dou213> RandolphCarter, the command u gave me returned a lot of info.. where do i see the model?
[02:49] <DBO> gnomefreak, vesa should work on anything though...
[02:49] <gnomefreak> Skye_: montior buttons do that here
[02:49] <bluetooth_azimut> and I got a pronlem using Skype
[02:49] <dou213> i'm on a laptop
[02:50] <gnomefreak> DBO: :( yeah it should
[02:50] <Skye_> my lcd is too bright
[02:50] <bluetooth_azimut> it says problem with your sound device
[02:50] <RandolphCarter> dou213: it'll be on the line that starts with "VGA compatible controller"
[02:50] <bluetooth_azimut> uses OSS
[02:50] <phreekbird> sup guys
[02:50] <dou213> aham ok thx
[02:50] <ompaul> bluetooth_azimut, the bot sent you a how to for skype have a look at that
[02:50] <bluetooth_azimut> ok
[02:51] <tuxtheslacker> hey, how do I set the root password?
[02:51] <ompaul> !root
[02:51] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[02:51] <_mason> How can i setup a proxy with username & login using a script ? (  i dont care about password being plaintext, nothing important )
[02:51] <zizie> question : what is the best control panel like webmin... ( i mean i need the free one except webmin ... ) if there is an option i prefer the packaged that i can install using apt-get install
[02:51] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, ^^ up a few lines
[02:51] <phreekbird> so .,.. tried a fresh install of xubuntu last night .... following the guide, typing server on the boot option didnt work.(kernel paniced and crashed) and running the install from the live cd after it booted didnt work (couldnt alocate HD spave) ... any other options?
[02:52] <ompaul> phreekbird, what version?
[02:52] <kyath> tuxtheslacker:system,admin,"user,groups"
[02:52] <phreekbird> dapar7
[02:52] <phreekbird> opnly version of xubuntu i saw that i could d/l
[02:52] <tuxtheslacker> umm, root is definetly not showing.
[02:53] <phreekbird> unless someone has a link for a stable release
[02:53] <bluetooth_azimut> thanks. seems useful
[02:53] <bluetooth_azimut> :)

[02:54] <CzarAlex`> Hello. Id like to change the local ports used for making outbound telnet connection to remote machines from the current 30000 - 60000 range to perhaps the 10000 - 15000 range. Can I do this? If so, how?
[02:54] <phreekbird> DBO: how? i looked up the update manager tryng to find xfce stuff but had no luck ... id rather go with a full new install anyway
[02:54] <ompaul> kyath, I gave him the root sudo page, he can then make his own mind up
[02:54] <henry54> linux_galore: the on board ones are quite extensive though.
[02:54] <_mason> How can i setup a Proxy with Username & Password via Terminal ?
[02:54] <kyath> lol think he got it now
[02:54] <rencrash> What is backports??

[02:55] <Kyral> damn you ompaul
[02:55] <rencrash> What is backports??

[02:57] <we2by> how do u bring back the title bar of gnome when u lost it when trying to setup Xgl? i can't remember the command
[02:57] <DBO> PuGz, just put it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[02:57] <PuGz> DBO: cheers
[02:57] <movies1978> does anyone know which is the right layout for an iboo keyboard?
[02:58] <tuxtheslacker> hey, it didn't let me change the root pass....
[02:58] <ompaul> kyath, it is the default "how you do stuff" in ubuntu behaviour that should be encouraged, that means when a person comes in here we can pretty much assume where they are starting from
[02:58] <henry54> oops, wrong shortcut..
[02:58] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, the page has that info on it
[02:59] <ph8> hey all, can anyone tell me if it's possible to get firefox/xchat opening on startup? They can't be saved with the rest of the session for some reason (which is annoying)
[02:59] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, use sudo its more fun, 1 week and you will wonder how you got on without it
[02:59] <ompaul> Riddell, is there a "gksudo" like thing for kde?

[03:01] <bigcx2> hey all

[03:01] <ubotu> skype is probably http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeHowto/ Breezy deb: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages/
[03:01] <bigcx2> i've got a question about launching things from the menu
[03:02] <bigcx2> i've installed a custom app to my menu bar
[03:02] <linux_galore> ph8: logout with both running
=== subsinker is now known as sub|afk
[03:02] <linux_galore> ph8: next time you login it will auto run them
[03:02] <Ng> ph8: System->Preferences->Session has an option for explicitly starting things manually
[03:02] <bigcx2> running from the command line yields success
[03:02] <bigcx2> but running from the menu dies with no output
[03:03] <bigcx2> i also tried toggling run from the terminal
[03:03] <bigcx2> this promptly brings up a terminal, then closes it without running anything
[03:03] <DBO> bigcx2, what command are you using to start from terminal?
[03:03] <henry54> linux_galore: yep, krita looks _really_ good too. koffice is catching up big time!
[03:03] <bigcx2> the same binary that i'm trying to run in the menu
[03:03] <tuxtheslacker> wow, this is soo much faster than fedora.
[03:03] <gnomefreak> ompaul: i think its kdsu/kdsudo but im not sure anymore
[03:03] <tuxtheslacker> the only problenm I have is that the root password does not want to stick.
[03:04] <ompaul> gnomefreak, thanks
[03:04] <gnomefreak> everything is faster than fedora
[03:04] <aLd> too true
[03:04] <gnomefreak> yw
[03:04] <tuxtheslacker> gnomefreak, this is true...
[03:04] <we2by> how do u bring back the title bar of gnome when u lost it when trying to setup Xgl? i can't remember the command
[03:04] <bigcx2> i was kinda just wondering if there was any other debugging i could put it through
[03:04] <tuxtheslacker> I was used to slackware.
[03:04] <tuxtheslacker> I went to fedoar, and cried...
[03:04] <tuxtheslacker> hahahah!
[03:04] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, you don't need it, use sudo, and it will if you read that info I gave you it is about half way down the page
[03:04] <linux_galore> yeah Ive been using Koffice for the last few weeks to generate odf files, koffice is way faster than OpenOffice
[03:04] <bigcx2> it seems like it just gets blackholed
[03:04] <gnomefreak> we2by: #ubuntu+1 or #ubuntu-xgl please
[03:04] <eggzeck> tuxtheslacker, "the root password does not want to stick"?
[03:04] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, you really don't need it, honestly
[03:05] <tuxtheslacker> oh okay.
[03:05] <tuxtheslacker> so long as the default accnt. has sudo?
[03:05] <eggzeck> But I would like to know what he meant by that :)
[03:05] <zeelot> hi everyone
[03:05] <bigcx2> no one?
[03:06] <JoaoJoao> it needs more glue
[03:06] <linux_galore> one thing I noticed about ubuntu is it needs to create more "groups", having to use sudo to open a usb music player is dumb, why isnt there a usb group by default
[03:06] <Ng> bigcx2: does it need to be run from a certain directory? or called with the full path?
[03:07] <bigcx2> the binary is in /usr/bin
[03:07] <alfredn> install question is this the right place
[03:07] <gnomefreak> linux_galore: i dont have to use sudo to open a music player
[03:07] <bigcx2> so it shouldn't
[03:07] <Ng> linux_galore: removeable devices are accessible to users in the plugdev group
[03:07] <bigcx2> need a full path
[03:07] <zizie> anyone pls
[03:07] <linux_galore> gnomefreak: I dont either but i had to edit the setup to get that
[03:07] <Ng> bigcx2: that's kinda strange. It might be outputting an error to the end of ~/.xsession-errors
[03:08] <gnomefreak> i didnt :(
[03:08] <zizie> question : what is the best control panel like webmin... ( i mean i need the free one except webmin ... ) if there is an option i prefer the packaged that i can install using apt-get install
[03:08] <alfredn> zizie: what was the question
[03:08] <bigcx2> yea i know
[03:08] <lhb> eggzeck: i guess what you get when you use sudo -i
[03:08] <bigcx2> hold on i'll check that
[03:08] <zizie> alfredn : that is  my prob :((
[03:08] <zeelot> i just migrate to ubuntu recently and there are some questions that i'm wondering....if there's anyone can give me some little help....i'm currently install ubuntu breezy,but i found that there's xubuntu existing and what's the mainly difference between the two version? just the X ? or there are some more?
[03:08] <gnomefreak> zizie: what is your problem?
[03:08] <zizie> question : what is the best control panel like webmin... ( i mean i need the free one except webmin ... ) if there is an option i prefer the packaged that i can install using apt-get install
[03:08] <Ng> zeelot: xubuntu just installs xfce instead of gnome as the desktop
[03:08] <lhb> !xububtu
[03:08] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, lhb
[03:09] <eggzeck> lhb, that's a bad explanation to what he said. Then he musn't have enabled root password ;)
[03:09] <linux_galore> gnomefreak: do you have a creative zen media player
[03:09] <alfredn> zizie: what is wrong with webmin
[03:09] <eggzeck> lhb, not that it's needed.
[03:09] <lhb> oops
[03:09] <bigcx2> hey thanks Ng! that spit out some useful info
[03:09] <gnomefreak> linux_galore: no
[03:09] <bigcx2> thats what i was lookin for
[03:09] <zizie> i cant setup it lolz
[03:09] <linux_galore> gnomefreak: borrow one and try and run gnomad2, it wont allow it without using sudo
[03:09] <gnomefreak> theres also kubuntu
[03:10] <alfredn> if you want to use webmin untar it from there web site not the apt-get way
[03:10] <gnomefreak> and a number of desktop enviornments
[03:10] <linux_galore> gnomefreak: all the other distro will allow gnomad2 to work as long as you add the user to the usb group
[03:10] <zizie> alfredn : i cant setup it lolz cause im newbie ... is that ok if i use webmin ?
[03:10] <mslade> well I'm already in the middle of it, but...
[03:10] <mslade> is it possible to have a root raid1 setup without a /boot part?
[03:10] <alfredn> zizie: that is how I started, sometimes I would use it and then look at the files it changed
[03:10] <zeelot> thanks Ng, another question, how's this xfce performance? sorry i never used that before....just want to try something new...
[03:10] <pussfeller> is thaere a rar client that supports multipart rars
[03:10] <dou213> anybody here who can guide me through a ATI driver installation?
[03:10] <gnomefreak> !webmin
[03:10] <ubotu> See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported
[03:11] <tuxtheslacker> hmm, the firefox plugin installer appears to have broken after trying to install the flash plugin.
[03:11] <Ng> zeelot: it's faster than gnome, but has way fewer features
[03:11] <tuxtheslacker> I'm also running software updates, maybe that caused a problem?
[03:11] <zizie> alfredn : is that enough install webmin ... cause i need apache and mysql either...
[03:11] <alfredn> zizie: just go to the website, download, untar ie tar xzvf and in it's folder will be a setup file just go sh setup and it will walk you through it
[03:11] <linux_galore> ubuntu's usb plugin setup works only with set device types, winder outside that and the user cant access the usb device
[03:11] <zizie> alfredn : is that enough install webmin ... cause i need apache and mysql either... or maybe i need install apache first ?
[03:11] <alfredn> zizie: yes webmin is it's own server no apache needed no mysql
[03:11] <zizie> alfredn : can i use apt-get install webmin ?
[03:12] <gnomefreak> zizie: you can have apache and mysql without having webmin
[03:12] <zeelot> thanks again Ng, i think i got it!:-)
[03:12] <alfredn> you can but I have better luck on their site, it is easy
[03:12] <zizie> verywell ty
[03:12] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell zizie about webmin
[03:12] <alfredn> zizie: from reading and experience the debian package was know to be buggy
[03:12] <zizie> i c

[03:17] <tenco> hi
[03:18] <tenco> how can i append kernel options to each kernel line in the grub config file menu.lst?
[03:18] <tenco> i tried kopt, but that didn't work
[03:18] <Ng> tenco: you can just put them on the end of the lines that start "kernel"
[03:19] <Ng> tenco: e.g. the root=, ro and so-on bits that are there already are kernel options
[03:19] <tenco> Ng: i know, but this gets overwritten each time a new kernel image gets installed or updated
[03:19] <Ng> tenco: that's a good point. If kopt isn't working then I'm not sure
[03:20] <tenco> Ng:  i need sth i can put outside the section marked with the automagic lines
[03:20] <CarlFK> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/ now only has "Alternate install dapper-alternate-i386.iso" - where is 'normal' ?
[03:20] <linux_galore> tenco:  sudo gedit /path/to/file

[03:20] <linux_galore> tenco: yeah but not everyone knows vim

[03:21] <linux_galore> not really, not everyone wants to know how to change a spark plug on a car, so not everyone wants to learn vim

[03:22] <ubotu> Dapper daily build CD images are available from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/
[03:22] <tenco> linux_galore: i only search for a grub config option with which i can append kernel options to each kernel line in menu.lst. strangely, the grub docs do not mention kopt

[03:22] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: um... then what is http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ ?
[03:23] <CarlFK> gnomefreak: and even if it is, where is 'normal' ?
[03:23] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: they will be stopping that if not done already

[03:49] <tuxtheslacker> wow, I DEFINETLY just found my favorite distrobution.
[03:50] <tuxtheslacker> Corey: what they're saying is that you can't log in as root.
[03:50] <ubuntu> joedj, I dont have the CD here
[03:50] <tuxtheslacker> Corey, ubuntu only lets you use sudo, which gives you access to root, but won't log you in as root.
[03:50] <Corey> you cant
[03:50] <Corey> um
[03:50] <Corey> ok
[03:51] <Ng> you can activate the root user if you really want to
[03:51] <Ng> it's just disabled by default
[03:51] <Ng> (and it's recommended to leave it that way)
[03:51] <mariuz> or is the wrong channel - no canonical admins here
[03:51] <mariuz> ?

[03:51] <spikeb> SUDO
[03:51] <DBO> nobody here works for canonical (as far as we know) mariuz
[03:51] <tuxtheslacker> Corey: u should use sudo. anyhting you need to do with root just type "sudo <command here>"

[03:51] <Corey> whats -i ?

[03:52] <Ng> Corey: man sudo :)
[03:52] <h2> is there a scp/sftp frontend for ubuntu?

[03:58] <Ng> tuxtheslacker: it's a systray icon, so you'd need to move the systray panel applet to another panel (right click on it and untick "Lock", then you can drag it around, possibly with the middle mouse button)
[03:58] <spikeb> tuxtheslacker: the entire top panel? right click on it and select delete this panel

[04:00] <Ng> !tell tuxtheslacker about RestrictedFormats
[04:00] <lemsx1> tuxtheslacker: enabled universe and multivers and do: apt-cache search java
[04:00] <Ng> tuxtheslacker: it's pretty easy
[04:00] <lemsx1> !java
[04:00] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[04:01] <Ng> the javadebs factoid tells you to install 1.4, which is blackdown, and sucks. Install the Sun one from the RestrictedFormats page :)
[04:02] <Corey> thanks
[04:02] <Corey> for anyone who needs to install java just type this in terminal
[04:02] <Corey> sudo apt-get install j2re1.4

[04:02] <Corey> its ont he ubuntu site.

[04:09] <fgarrido> ola ablas espaol
[04:09] <Ng> azimuth: there is an ubuntu laptop team (search the wiki), perhaps they can shed some light on the issue?
[04:10] <Celestianpower> Ng: That was it - what does it want in the server field?
[04:10] <Celestianpower> Evolution that is
[04:10] <fgarrido> ola
[04:10] <endless_us> hi guys. I need how to for installing irtrans. Please help.
[04:10] <Ng> Celestianpower: that's probably asking for your email settings. you don't have to give it any, you can just leave that unconfigured if you want and use the local calendar
[04:10] <Marlun> can I write some command to see what version of ubuntu I've got installed?
[04:11] <fgarrido> adios
[04:11] <Ng> Marlun: lsb_release -a
[04:11] <Celestianpower> Ng: No, because it won't let me continue
[04:11] <Ng> Celestianpower: is it a wizard thing? can you just cancel it?
[04:12] <Marlun> Ng: thanks, I'll try it.
[04:12] <Celestianpower> Ng: It just closes if I press cancel
[04:12] <snowfaked> is there a way to monitor if users run command on specific files?
[04:12] <snowfaked> e.g. if i wanted to log all commands when users read/write files in etc from command line?
[04:14] <njan> snowfaked, there is capacity in the kernel to perform onaccess actions of various sorts, but you'd probably have to go for something like rootsh and just log everything..
[04:14] <zeelot> hey there thanks for your help i'm using xfce4 now and it's really simple UI!
[04:14] <njan> snowfaked, unless you felt like some coding. I'm not sure if there's anything that will do specific file-by-file auditing.
[04:14] <Frogzoo> snowfaked: take a look at dnotify
[04:15] <Corey> um..i just tried to install and it said something about i should become a non-rootuser !?
[04:15] <Ng> zeelot: :)
[04:15] <zeelot> thanks Ng~
[04:16] <zeelot> you guys are nice~
[04:16] <Ng> we try :)
[04:16] <Corey> You are real root -- unfortunately, some Java distributions have
[04:16] <Corey> install scripts that directly manipulate /etc, and may cause some
[04:16] <Corey> inconsistencies on your system. Instead, you should become a
[04:16] <Corey> non-root user and run:
[04:16] <Corey> fakeroot make-jpkg /home/admin/jdk-1_5_0_06-nb-5_0-linux.bin
[04:16] <Corey> which will allow no damage to be done to your system files and
[04:16] <Corey> still permit the Java distribution to successfully extract.
[04:16] <Corey> sorry !
[04:16] <zeelot> i got to get familiar with this interface right now~ha
[04:16] <Frogzoo> !enter
[04:16] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[04:16] <Ng> snowfaked: bash logs user commands to a file called .bash_history in their home directories - you can override that in the global bash settings, so you could have them log somewhere else and grep them repeatedly for whatever you're looking for, but that's a bit hacky
[04:16] <snowfaked> njan: ok, i guess i just need to use process account for logging eveything and parse the file to suit my needs
[04:16] <njan> Ng, it's hacky and insecure
[04:16] <Ng> Corey: install the fakeroot package and do what the error says
[04:17] <njan> Ng, it's very, very trivial to bypass
[04:17] <Corey> fakeroot package?
[04:17] <njan> Ng, either using history -c or unsetting the history variable
[04:17] <endless_us> Is any one ever setup irtrans? Need help on how to. PLEASE
[04:17] <Ng> njan: you can prevent users from changing given variables, but yes, it's still possible to work round it easily enough
[04:17] <Ng> Corey: the package called fakeroot. install it with synaptic or apt-get
[04:17] <njan> Ng, to the point at which it's not really worth bother with, unfortunately.
[04:18] <Corey> ok
[04:18] <Ng> njan: depends how much you trust your users and how much you actually want to monitor them I suppose
[04:18] <shadowman> sup linux lovers ;-)
[04:18] <njan> Ng, sure - but messing around with .bash_history is just as hard as just setting up rootsh, and rootsh actually is half-way secure. At least compared to .bash_history :)
[04:19] <Ng> Corey: any time someone tells you to install some package or other, we mean use synaptic or apt-get :)
[04:19] <njan> rootsh syslogs, too, which means you can log it off the box, so even if it isn't secure, it's at least logged offbox, so you have some sort of tamperproofing.
[04:19] <Corey> Ng: yeah fakeroot wal aready installed and newest version
[04:19] <Ng> excellent
[04:19] <Corey> Ng: when i try toinstall something it gives me an erorr sayingi shouldnt bea  root
[04:20] <Frogzoo> Corey: and are you logged in as root?
[04:21] <Corey> my uuser has root settings
[04:21] <Corey> I went to usergroups and changed my thing to root
[04:21] <Frogzoo> Corey: synaptic should be run as nonroot - apt-get install as root
=== revolations2525 is now known as revolver
[04:22] <Frogzoo> Corey: ubuntu prevents root access for a reason, btw
[04:22] <Corey> its an apt-get thing !
[04:22] <sohmestra> for some reason, I cannot type the character 'b' in gnome terminal
[04:22] <shadowman> lol
[04:23] <Ng> Corey: that's ok, it's just because of the way the sun java deb making process works
[04:23] <sohmestra> i can in any other program..
[04:23] <Frogzoo> Corey: 'apt-get install' should work
[04:23] <rencrash> in synaptic is there a C compiler i can install?
[04:23] <Frogzoo> sohmestra: have you changed key maps? or is your kb just broken?
[04:23] <Corey> its coming up with abort
[04:23] <Ng> rencrash: build-essential includes most of the basics you need to compile things
[04:23] <Corey> im going to try another thing :>
[04:23] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: no, I switched keyaords and the prolem persists
[04:24] <rencrash> thanks ng
[04:24] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: would my keymap e different in gnome terminal than in the rest of gnome?
[04:24] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: any way to check that out?
[04:25] <Frogzoo> sohmestra: check you haven't got 'b' bound to anything - eg -> Edit -> Current Profile
[04:25] <interprb> cant figure this one out. when i boot u-box our dns records show that the ubuntu box request an a record for hotmail.com. we dont use hotmail??
[04:26] <sohmestra> an interesting data point: I can type 'b' if I turn on capslock then type shift 'b'
=== beyond is now known as beyond-out
[04:26] <phreeza> i've got a toshiba sattelite M40X and i'm trying to get the play pause stop etc keys working, does anyone have an idea how to do that?
[04:26] <Ng> interprb: someone using an MSN messenger client maybe?
[04:26] <Frogzoo> sohmestra: so I double suspect 'b' is bound to something
[04:26] <interprb> no
[04:27] <interprb> we see dns in real time
[04:27] <Ng> interprb: trace the packets and see what they are then
[04:27] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: that was it
[04:27] <Frogzoo> interprb: can you run ethereal from another box to capture a trace?
[04:27] <Frogzoo> sohmestra: ta da!
[04:27] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: it was bound to the paste function
[04:27] <interprb> yes and i have
[04:27] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: muchas gracias
[04:27] <Frogzoo> sohmestra: yw, enjoy
[04:28] <Frogzoo> interprb: and nothing?
[04:28] <interprb> ip match hotmail
[04:28] <Frogzoo> interprb: yes, but is there any mail sent? if so, which address? just looking for giveaway clues
[04:29] <miter> how to search/filter in "ps -aux" for a special term (ex. "firefox")
[04:29] <Ng> miter: ps auwx | grep firefox
[04:29] <interprb> no mail sent
[04:29] <Ng> interprb: I'd be extremely surprised if a default install is sending packets to hotmail.com, so something must be installed that someone is using to check their mail or use MSN or similar
[04:29] <Ng> or you've been rooted or something
[04:29] <Frogzoo> interprb: so _some_ process looks up a hotmail address, but doesn't do anything with it? kinda wierd

[04:36] <Joene> Hey all! I've just installed a Conexant Accesrunner PCI ADSL modem in my ubuntu box. Setting up driver was no problem, the modem works fine. But when i'm putting the line it, the thing won't synchronize. Does someone know if this modem is compatible with an ISDN ADSL line?
[04:36] <Celestianpower> It now does this: "Host lookup failed: pop.gmail.com port 995: Name or service not known"
[04:36] <anil> But forgzoo I use sudo pppd call gprs instead of pon
[04:36] <Frogzoo> Joene: there's no such thing as ISDN ADSL.... ?!
[04:36] <anndy> thatz guys...it seems my problem got solved
[04:37] <anil> But Frogzoo I use sudo pppd call gprs instead of pon, will poff work?
[04:37] <sohmestra> Celestianpower: ISDN and ASDL are two totally different things
[04:37] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: make sure incomming is set to ssl and outgoing is set to tls
[04:37] <Frogzoo> anil: it will if you setup pon properly :)
[04:37] <gnomefreak> or tsl or whatever its called
[04:37] <anil> Frogzoo pleas tell me
[04:37] <sohmestra> Celestianpower: is it ISDN or ASDL?
[04:37] <tijn_> its an isdn line
[04:37] <anil> hwo to setup pon for gprs?
[04:37] <tijn_> so its adsl delivered over isdn
[04:38] <Joene> Frogzoo: it's a splitted isdn line
[04:38] <Frogzoo> tijn_: you need a TA/ISDN modem - not an ADSL modem
[04:38] <Celestianpower> gnomefreak: Where do I do that?
[04:38] <tijn_> Frogzoo: nope
[04:38] <Celestianpower> I can't see a field that asks me that
[04:38] <anil> How to clear channels ? I use sudo pppd call myscript
[04:38] <tijn_> we have alwayes used a normal adsl router
[04:38] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: in the prefferences/account prefferences  i think its accounts
[04:38] <Corey> java installed !
[04:38] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: you should see a choice when you search through the options
[04:39] <anil> Frogzoo tell me please
[04:39] <anndy> yes i have added that
[04:39] <Celestianpower> gnomefreak: I can't see one
[04:39] <Frogzoo> anil: just configure pon to use your settings
[04:39] <Celestianpower> I'm there
[04:39] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: normally the same area where you set the ports
[04:39] <interprb> thanks
[04:39] <tijn_> Frogzoo its works ok with a zyxel
[04:39] <Frogzoo> tijn_: ISDN & ADSL over the same pair? wierd, but nice - news to me
[04:39] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: its beena while since i used evo but the settings are the same for all gmail and most mail clients
[04:40] <anndy> anil: http://turtiainen.dna.fi/GPRS-HOWTO

[04:40] <Celestianpower> gnomefreak: I'm here: www.clematis.plus.com/Evolution.png

[04:41] <anndy> anil: http://easyconnect.linuxuser.hu/modules/index/
[04:41] <Frogzoo> tijn_: Joene: do you need a specific high pass filter between the modem & the ISDN line?
[04:41] <gnomefreak> DBO: ?
[04:41] <tijn_> Frogzoo: nope
[04:41] <azimuth> when is next release?
[04:41] <anndy> anil: try reading these links....may be you can get your problem solved
[04:41] <Frogzoo> tijn_: but you will need a high pass filter - that's standard for ADSL...
[04:42] <Corey> cross over office work good for dreamweaver ?
[04:42] <Frogzoo> so Joene - have you got a high pass filter installed?
[04:42] <sohmestra> Frogzoo: it's standard, but not always necessary for ADSL over POTS.
[04:43] <Joene> Frogzoo: i've you are mening the splitter ... yes
[04:43] <Joene> *meaning
[04:43] <Frogzoo> Joene: depends what the splitter does really
[04:43] <topyli> azimuth: june 1st
[04:43] <Frogzoo> Joene: take it up with your isp at this stage
[04:43] <azimuth> ok
[04:44] <Joene> Frogzoo: yep ... calling atm ;)
[04:44] <azimuth> have I to reinstall the OS at all?

[04:50] <ubotu> I heard frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
[04:50] <Corey> frost wire is a cheap ripof of limeiwre !

[04:51] <azimuth> when it will be possible to work with NTFS partitons in full access mode??
[04:51] <topyli> Corey: haven't seen limewire in a while, but it did seem to be pretty much crack
[04:51] <apokryphos> Corey: it's not a "rip-off", read their mission statement. Also, please drop the caps.
[04:51] <kOpter> Because I want to run XGL, I need a new videocard (PCI). Now I know I need an Nvidea, but I also read most ATI problems are now fixed.. Who knows more about this?
[04:51] <ringe> dpkg-reconfigure grub configures the wrong root partition, using (hd0,5) which is home in stead of (hd0,1) which is root. What can I do about it?

[04:53] <Corey> Is it possible for the linux world to make a huge partition and send into developers such as adobe so they port all there software to linux.
[04:53] <topyli> ringe: hrm, then it should be fixed properly
[04:54] <kOpter> azimuth: Never, because it's closed source
[04:54] <YoussefAssad> afternoon folks

[04:55] <kOpter> azimuth: You can run it via Wine, but then you're just using a windows DLL for which you need a full windows licence
[04:56] <krang> k0pter: I see no profile in there
[04:56] <gnomefreak> Celestianpower: did you enable pop access from your gmail settings?

[04:59] <Frogzoo> !tell Corey about wine
[04:59] <tijn_> it should work, a few config files need to change
[04:59] <kOpter> Corey: It's not that simple..
[04:59] <Corey> Frogzoo i know wine lol
[04:59] <krang> !tell krang about wine
[04:59] <kOpter> Corey: You need to emulate the ENTIRE windows API
[04:59] <Kwerty> I tend to get on quite well with toffee-nosed, stuck-up wine critics.
[04:59] <kOpter> Corey: Which is mostly closed source
[04:59] <Corey> indeed.
[05:00] <topyli> kOpter: you don't need to emulate it, you need to rewrite it :)
[05:00] <krang> Kwerty: jolly good, but you can't deny that they make incredibly boring websites
[05:00] <Kwerty> krang: True.
[05:00] <bjorn_ar> help
[05:00] <CatalinuX> Hi ... how can I make a script in ubuntu that runs a given command ad infinitum ?

[05:00] <anil> is debian better than ubuntu?
[05:00] <anil> is debian better than ubuntu?
[05:00] <Mortal`> Hey. I just downloaded a Skype for Debian package, it's a .deb-file. Do they usually work with Archive Manager? It couldn't open it since the "package type is not supported".
[05:01] <Ng> anil: they're different.
[05:01] <Ng> anil: and please don't repeat your questions, it's kind of rude ;)
[05:01] <spikeb> Mortal`: use gdebi instead of archive manager
[05:01] <Mortal`> Okay, thanks
[05:01] <kOpter> krang: edit /etc/passwd
[05:01] <tuxtheslacker> in an ln... do I do ln-s /path/that/is/the/package /place/that/links

[05:02] <CatalinuX> Ng: What extension should it have ?
[05:02] <Kwerty> Ow
[05:02] <Corey> Do you think if we started up a gaint partition of people who want it ported they would do it /
[05:02] <Ng> CatalinuX: extension? you want to put this in a script?
[05:02] <anil> hey my c progrmans in vi dont have colors
[05:02] <anil> hey my c progrmans in vi dont have colors

[05:03] <krang> k0pter: oh, are those path dirs on the ends? Still, I see stuff in my root path that isn't there
[05:04] <Frogzoo> Corey: you don't - but it's a - 'petition' - not a 'partition' I think you mean
[05:04] <Ng> CatalinuX: put the first line of the script as "#!/bin/sh" and chmod +x the file
[05:04] <Ng> CatalinuX: no extension needed
[05:04] <Corey> ok
[05:05] <tubbie> how do I configure shotcut-keys?
[05:05] <kOpter> krang: If you don't know what you're doing.. to go messing with your root account :)

[05:06] <Iam8up|lpy> is nautalus the app that controls the dir/file browing? similar to explorer in windows?
[05:06] <krang> k0pter: Live CD's make broken passwd files come back happy!
[05:06] <mjr> Iam8up|lpy, yes
[05:07] <mjr> (though "nautilus")
[05:07] <kOpter> krang: true :)
[05:07] <Iam8up|lpy> mjr - then why doe sit crash when i click on files an try to archive them?
[05:07] <Iam8up|lpy> i highlight a bunch of files, right click create archive, and it crashes _every_ time
[05:07] <kOpter> krang: But what don't you understand about the password file?
[05:07] <mjr> Iam8up|lpy, apparently there's a crash
[05:07] <mjr> umm, a bug I mean
[05:07] <anil> Tell me how to have colorful syntax for c progs in vi
[05:07] <krang> k0pter: what all the fields are

[05:07] <Subhuman> anil, in /etc/vim/vimrc
[05:07] <anil> why ppl are not answering me
[05:07] <Ng> anil: did you not read what I said earlier about repeating questions?
[05:08] <mjr> Iam8up|lpy, you can report it via http://www.ubuntu.com/support/bugs
[05:08] <Iam8up|lpy> is there some other easy gui way to make a bz2?
[05:08] <krang> k0pter: I know the username, password/shadow
[05:08] <Subhuman> anil, jus look through and youll see a commented line to enable colour, itz just a case of reading it
[05:08] <keiaah> Hi all. I have a question about doing a server install. I just to run fluxbox, now I am going to switch (for Openbox). After the corepackages is installed, can I do "sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core openbox obconf gdm eterm"? Do I have to generate the menu myself, or is it done automaticlly, like with Fluxbox?
[05:08] <krang> k0pter: that's it
[05:08] <anil> ok
[05:08] <YoussefAssad> keiaah: IIRC I think there's a generated menu
[05:09] <YoussefAssad> keiaah: it's actually a submenu off menu.xml calld Debian
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[05:09] <keiaah> YoussefAssad, thanks
[05:09] <jay> hi
[05:09] <YoussefAssad> I tend to ignore it. Frequent apps in a handmade submenu, the rest launched form the ever present aterm
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[05:10] <richiefrich> Flannel: u here ?
[05:10] <keiaah> yeah, aterm is the best. using eterm for the wallpaper thou
[05:11] <anil> which line or option in /etv/vim/vimrc?
[05:11] <Iam8up|lpy> mjr - is nautilus included in it's own package? or is it part of gnome?
[05:11] <Ng> Iam8up|lpy: it's in its own package, but it's also part of gnome
[05:11] <Ng> (in that gnome isn't a package, it's a collection of software)
[05:11] <Iam8up|lpy> ok, thanks
[05:11] <phreeza> is there a way to create links from nautilus?
[05:11] <Iam8up|lpy> oh, ok
[05:12] <Ng> phreeza: right click on something and choose Make Link
[05:12] <anil> which line or option in /etv/vim/vimrc to get color for syntax for c porgs?
[05:12] <Corey> anybody used cedega before ?
[05:12] <LiQuiD8468> hey guys
[05:12] <keiaah> Corey, I did
[05:12] <LiQuiD8468> anyone know where i can get the latest version of aircrack ?
[05:12] <Corey> keiahh: did it work good ?
[05:12] <Frogzoo> Corey: currently wine is 'better' than cedega
[05:12] <phreeza> \me slaps himself, Ng
[05:13] <keiaah> Corey, It really does.
[05:13] <phreeza> \ slaps himself, Ng
[05:13] <Corey> really...
[05:13] <phreeza> lol
[05:13] <Ng> LiQuiD8468: 2.3 is in dapper, which is out a week tomorrow
[05:13] <Corey> Frogzoo: I couldnt get wine to open game..
[05:13] <Frogzoo> Corey: which game?
[05:13] <LiQuiD8468> im going to get the live cd tonight
[05:13] <LiQuiD8468> so where can i get it tonight?
[05:13] <pez> Is there anyone that can help me with my installation of Ubuntu 5.10 on my AMD 64 with Nvdia 6800GS graphics card? I can't see anything when it kicks after login
[05:13] <LiQuiD8468> so i can use it on my live cd?
[05:14] <Ng> LiQuiD8468: it's unlikely to be in the default live cd because it's in the universe repository
[05:14] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, its not on the LiveCD, its in the repos
[05:14] <Frogzoo> pez: run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' should fix it in most cases
[05:14] <Corey> Frogzoo: Artifact www.samugames.com/artifact
[05:14] <anil> hey it worked nice!!!!
[05:14] <LiQuiD8468> okay, so in using the live cd, can i go to the repos, and get it, and be able to use it?....ive never used a live cd before
[05:14] <Ng> LiQuiD8468: I'm not sure, I haven't really used the live CDs either
[05:14] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, yes you can, but it will be gone once you restart
[05:15] <Corey> it doesnt even open the file..
[05:15] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, also be aware that it will have to sit in ram, so you will be eating lots of RAM that way
[05:15] <Frogzoo> Corey: artifact mage?
[05:15] <anil> latest Firefox avalilable in reposirories?
[05:15] <LiQuiD8468> okay
[05:15] <LiQuiD8468> well thanks for the help
[05:15] <Corey> Frogzoo: what ?
[05:15] <pez> Frogzoo: thanks :-) what does that command do?
[05:15] <DBO> anil, dapper yes, breezy no
[05:15] <anil> ok
[05:15] <LiQuiD8468> its been a while since i used linux...how do i go about gettin it from the repos?
[05:15] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, sudo apt-get install <package>
[05:16] <anil> also which package is need for firefox to run in breezy?
[05:16] <Ng> anil: search the repositories and find out :)
[05:16] <Frogzoo> Corey: have you looked in appdb.winehq.org ?
[05:16] <Kennie> apt-cache search firefox
[05:16] <Kennie> ;)
[05:16] <Frogzoo> pez: customises your xorg.conf
[05:16] <r0xoR> does wget send files also?
[05:16] <LiQuiD8468> what is the actual package name for aircrack ? do you know ?
[05:16] <Corey> no
[05:16] <Ng> r0xoR: probably not, but curl should be able to
[05:16] <r0xoR> or is there a utility that perfroms the reverse function of wget
[05:16] <Ng> LiQuiD8468: just aircrack
[05:16] <LiQuiD8468> oo okay
[05:17] <r0xoR> Ng, curl, really... huh, i thought that was a "URL library"
[05:17] <LiQuiD8468> so i can just search for that, and use it....anyone here used it before?...
[05:17] <Ng> r0xoR: that's libcurl, curl is a tool that uses libcurl :)
[05:17] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, yeah, but if you are wanting a security audit live boot, why not get Backtrack?
[05:17] <Frogzoo> LiQuiD8468: has to be aircrack? considered kismet?
[05:18] <LiQuiD8468> thats waht i was thinking, backtrack, but i have had a lot of problems gettin linux to recognize and work with my wireless, ubuntu was the eastier to get working
[05:18] <LiQuiD8468> so i was going to use that
[05:18] <pez> frogzoo: what can i run the command 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' from as i cant see the screen?
[05:18] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, check out nubuntu then
[05:18] <LiQuiD8468> what is kimset?
[05:18] <LiQuiD8468> nubuntu comes with aircrack?
[05:18] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, I believe so
[05:18] <Frogzoo> pez: ctrl alt F1 - should bring up a terminal
[05:18] <Corey> how do you run something in wine ?
[05:19] <LiQuiD8468> hmm okay....what is kimset, does the same thing as aircrak?
[05:19] <pez> thanks Frogzoo :-)
[05:19] <topyli> wine windows-app.exe
[05:19] <Corey> its not working
[05:19] <Corey> its just waiting for ever
[05:19] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, dismet is a 802.11b monitoring too
[05:19] <DBO> l
[05:19] <anil> when I do ctrl + alt + f1, it goes to text mode! but after that when I do ctrl + alt + f7, it shows blank scrren with ony mose pointer
[05:19] <Frogzoo> Corey: 'wine app.exe'
[05:19] <topyli> Corey: well. sol.exe will probably work, something else might well fail
[05:19] <Corey> Frogzoo: not working :(
[05:19] <anil> when I do ctrl + alt + f1, it goes to text mode! but after that when I do ctrl + alt + f7, it shows blank scrren with ony mouse pointer? what is problem
[05:19] <LiQuiD8468> so do i need that and aircrack in order to crack networks?
[05:20] <phreeza> where is the automounting of usb sticks handled?
[05:20] <Frogzoo> Corey: 'wine notepad'  works?
[05:20] <topyli> LiQuiD8468: you don't crack networks around here
[05:20] <Frogzoo> phreeza: it's called hotplug
[05:20] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, cracking network encrypting is illegal
[05:20] <LiQuiD8468> o ok
[05:20] <Corey> Frogzoo: no
[05:20] <Frogzoo> DBO: not if it's your network :D
[05:20] <Corey> Frogzoo: it like goes the next line in terminal and does nothing
[05:21] <DBO> Frogzoo, well yes...  which is why these tools are legal =)
[05:21] <Frogzoo> Corey: well wine's broken - did you install the sourceforge deb?
[05:21] <LiQuiD8468> ya i was just using my own network, just trying to gain information, not use it for anything else
[05:21] <LiQuiD8468> trying to learn stuff
[05:21] <Corey> no ?
[05:21] <LiQuiD8468> not use for illegal purpose
[05:21] <lym> HI
[05:21] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, I suggest running ethereal at the same time then, that way you can view the logs of what went on
[05:21] <anil>  help me! when I do ctrl + alt + f1, it goes to text mode! but after that when I do ctrl + alt + f7, it shows blank scrren with ony mouse pointer? what is problem
[05:21] <topyli> Corey: are you actually giving the right executable as the argument for wine?
[05:21] <Frogzoo> Corey: wine --version      0.9.12?
[05:21] <topyli> Corey: give it the full path to the exe
[05:21] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, but aircrack is more offensive, kismet is more defensive, but both work on wireless networks
[05:22] <phreeza> Frogzoo: is there a specific script? theres a bunch of them in /etc/hotplug
[05:22] <Corey> i am and its not working !
[05:22] <aLPHa_LeaK> tach
[05:22] <topyli> Corey: then it's not working
[05:22] <LiQuiD8468> so, lets say that i was wanting to crack my own wireless network key, what program would u recomend that i use?, what do you think would be easier?
[05:22] <Frogzoo> LiQuiD8468: I rec'd kismet
[05:23] <anil>  help me! when I do ctrl + alt + f1, it goes to text mode! but after that when I do ctrl + alt + f7, it shows blank scrren with ony mouse pointer? what is problem
[05:23] <topyli> LiQuiD8468: i would suggest you should know your own network key
[05:23] <r0xoR> hehe
[05:23] <r0xoR> wput is opposite of wget
[05:23] <r0xoR> whod'a thunk it
[05:23] <anil> I am noob
[05:23] <DBO> topyli, hehe...  good point =P
[05:23] <aLPHa_LeaK> LiQuiD8468, aircrack? airsnort? wepcrack? the list is nearly endless
[05:23] <LiQuiD8468> ya i forgot what it was
[05:23] <LiQuiD8468> i wass just wondering what you guys thought was the best
[05:23] <LiQuiD8468> i just assumed aircrack since i have seen that one the most
[05:23] <topyli> no help here
[05:24] <ph8> hey all, can anyone tell me if it's possible to get firefox/xchat opening on startup? They can't be saved with the rest of the session for some reason (which is annoying)
[05:24] <DBO> LiQuiD8468, we are crossing over to a rather grey area, if you wish to persue aircrack you might be better off doing so privately
[05:24] <topyli> ph8: they're not gnome-session compatible apps. you need to add them to the session
[05:24] <phreeza> Frogzoo: ok found it
[05:25] <Frogzoo> ph8: system -> prefs -> sessions - startup programs
[05:25] <ph8> thanks
[05:25] <Blue89> nevermind, I found what I was looking for
[05:26] <benoy> Is it possible to have an operating system run off an external hard drive?
[05:26] <ubuntuneil> !repositories
[05:26] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[05:27] <topyli> benoy: i would guess it is, as long as your bios knows about it
[05:28] <Frogzoo> topyli: benoy don't know if lilo/grub support usb...
[05:29] <benoy> oh
[05:29] <topyli> yeah it will run just fine but something has to boot it :)
[05:30] <topyli> anyway there are linux distros that boot from usb flash memory so why not a hard drive
[05:32] <sc0ty> files list file for package `libuuid1' is missing final newline
[05:32] <willert> #ubuntu-legal
[05:32] <sc0ty> this appens every time i try to install a program in ubuntu
[05:32] <icheyne> anyone tried xubuntu? is it any good? is it fast?
[05:33] <Iam8up|lpy> is there a way to mount a windows share on the live cd?
[05:33] <sc0ty> how can i fix this?
[05:33] <Iam8up|lpy> icheyne - it's just like ubuntu or kubuntu with a different desktop
[05:33] <apokryphos> icheyne: it's ok enough if you like xfce. Personally I'd really rather not confine myself to xfce
[05:33] <apokryphos> (or gnome, for that matter, really)
[05:34] <icheyne> I might use it on my wife's P3 256RAM
[05:34] <icheyne> i quite like xfce
[05:34] <apokryphos> it's better for lower-end systems, yeah
[05:34] <Iam8up|lpy> icheyne - i think that gnome should well with that much ram - it does for me
[05:34] <icheyne> if it's solid like Ubuntu and has the same hardware detection
[05:34] <Iam8up|lpy> it's the same thing...
[05:34] <icheyne> and most ubuntu problems can be fixed with the same tools
[05:34] <icheyne> then I'll try it
[05:34] <icheyne> cool
[05:35] <icheyne> sounds good
[05:35] <icheyne> thanks!
[05:35] <Iam8up|lpy> ubuntu = kubuntu = xubuntu
[05:35] <icheyne> :)
[05:35] <Iam8up|lpy> gnome/kde/xfce
[05:35] <apokryphos> icheyne: it's ubuntu - gnome + xfce and some tools
[05:35] <icheyne> superb
[05:35] <apokryphos> see #xubuntu for others using it :)
[05:35] <icheyne> will do
[05:35] <Iam8up|lpy> is there a way to mount a windows share while using the live cd?
[05:35] <Frogzoo> !tell icheyne about enter
[05:35] <sc0ty>  files list file for package `libuuid1' is missing final newline <--?
[05:35] <sc0ty> how to fix this?
[05:36] <Iam8up|lpy> sc0ty - google anything?
[05:36] <sc0ty> nop
[05:36] <Corey> laggg
[05:36] <Frogzoo> sc0ty: uninstall/reinstall pkg?
[05:36] <Iam8up|lpy> try it then..
[05:36] <Mortal`> Hey, I'm trying to install some applications, but I need to insert my Ubuntu CD (which I can't find :S). Why is that so? Can't it download the needed archives from the net?
[05:36] <sc0ty> i can reinstall or uninstal any package
[05:36] <Iam8up|lpy> Mortal` - using apt-get it asks for the cd???
[05:36] <Frogzoo> Mortal`: in synaptic, disable the cd repo
[05:37] <Mortal`> Iam8up|lpy, I'm using the Applications>Add Applications>Advanced thing.
[05:37] <Iam8up|lpy> oh..
[05:37] <topyli> Mortal`: i think that's synaptic :)
[05:38] <Mortal`> Hehe, topyli, I see it is
[05:38] <Mortal`> I tried running 'synaptic' from console, and it said it was already running :)~

I've been looking all over ubuntu.com for pointers and documents about what requirements will come with that (e.g. could I just refer to Ubuntu for source packages or do I have to set up my own mirror). And how about rebranding and slimming the distro down? Can anybody help me with these aspects?
[05:57] <Ng> lastnode: you could try commenting out the server in /etc/default/ntpdate
[05:57] <gnomefreak> lastnode: are you sure its not syncing to the bios?

[06:17] <Hentai_Jeff|stud> anyone know what the best USB 2.0 PCI card for ubuntu is?

[06:18] <bigcx2> ?
[06:18] <Stargazers> So that is not problem at least
[06:18] <bigcx2> i'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish
[06:19] <Stargazers> I try to use 300 MHz computer without hard drive using full system in NFS server. I load kernel on NFS server computer, it loads fine etc, but when it tries to mount root file system, it won't do it right
[06:19] <Stargazers> But if I mount NFS drive after that (in 5 minute waiting I'm going always to BusyBox) I can do it
=== rose is now known as rose2020

[06:22] <Hentai_Jeff|stud> only stupid ppl
[06:22] <Stargazers> Well, have to look...

[06:23] <dergringo> can anyone help me to solve this problem: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14599 ?
[06:24] <Stargazers> Thx, Frogzoo, but I have looked those couple of days...
[06:24] <Stargazers> :/
[06:25] <Frogzoo> Stargazers: nfs should be relatively straightforward - what's not working?
[06:25] <Stargazers> Frogzoo: I can't mount root filesystem with it
[06:25] <ompaul> dergringo, sudo apt-get install opennap - make sure you have the universe repos installed first
[06:25] <ompaul> !tell dergringo about universe
[06:25] <bigcx2> does anyone have a good solution to overriding/replacing gnu's java with the new sun packages in multiverse?
[06:25] <dergringo> ompaul: is this the gift plugin or a standalone? I want to use it in apollon
[06:26] <ompaul> dergringo, its a server
[06:26] <mwe> bigcx2: dpkg-reconfigure java
[06:26] <mwe> bigcx2: with sudo
[06:26] <Stargazers> I mean, I have a NFS server. I share dir /tftpboot/192.168.0.1 to other computer. But, I can't make it work as a root filesystem of that 192.168.0.1 computer. I can mount that dir after it goes to BusyBox
[06:26] <dergringo> ompaul: I have already gift server configured and I want to add opennap
[06:26] <Corey> im about to possibly wipe 60GB of data O_o
[06:26] <mwe> bigcx2: and sudo dpkg-reconfigure javac if you installed the sdk
[06:26] <mwe> bigcx2: oh no
[06:26] <bigcx2> mwe: java and javac are not packages
[06:26] <mwe> bigcx2: it's update-alternatives. sorry
[06:27] <gnomefreak> sudo update-alternatives --config java  or javac
[06:27] <Frogzoo> Stargazers: I'm thinking it's not an nfs problem, but a boot issue
[06:27] <pUm> Stargazers ... Kernel is booting .. and the initrd does not work ?
[06:27] <ompaul> dergringo, sudo apt-get install apollon might help here
[06:28] <ompaul> dergringo, best to use the local software until you find something that does not do the job
[06:28] <gnomefreak> what is java if not a package?
[06:28] <Stargazers> pUm: No, both of them works fine
[06:28] <bigcx2> very nice
[06:29] <dergringo> ompaul: apollon is already running with fasttrack, openft, ares, gnutella
[06:29] <Stargazers> But ROOT filesystem mount not
[06:29] <bigcx2> mwe: great tip thanks
[06:29] <dergringo> ompaul: I just want to add opennap
[06:29] <Stargazers> Frogzoo: Any ideas what I can do?
[06:29] <mwe> bigcx2: yw
[06:30] <ompaul> dergringo,  opennap - Open source Napster server. is all it says
[06:30] <pUm> Stargazers: yes, i thinking about the moment initrd <--> rootfs ... did you look at the initrd script ? debian has a extra package for netboot. i think you already applied the other changes in fstab rc.* etc ?!
[06:30] <Stargazers> pUm: Uh, can you paste URL to tutorials etc?
[06:30] <rajeev> i m not getting sound on my system while opening volume control its says that"No volume control elements and/or devices found" so can any one tell me what to do?

[06:52] <FarrisG> Can anyone give me a usable solution to printing from AcroRead to a PostScript network printer? I can print to it fine using any gnome-friendly app that will see my cups printers, but AcroRead wants me to specify a command to run, and I can't get lp/lpr or anything to print properly through my cups-enabled printers. Is there some sort of wrapper that will take lp commands and send them through cups?

[06:55] <rajeev> mdeboer,after giving this command i m gettin no such files or directory is there
[06:55] <Dr_Willis> lesshaste,  AHH...
[06:55] <Dr_Willis> lesshaste,  you can disable the logging in to a VT. ;P thats similer effect - but i forget how.
[06:56] <Dr_Willis> lesshaste,  or you could just not spawn any vt's   - gotta love 12 ways to do somthing
[06:56] <YoussefAssad> carthik: precisely! Thanks

[07:02] <NoUse> Mariws if its a 3D game, you need your graphics drivers installed

[07:03] <Frogzoo> gesho: sudo cat /dev/input/mice   & move the mouse about - do you get output?
[07:03] <mdeboer> rajeev: in the filesystem under /proc/asound you will find information about alsa (the linux sound driver)

[07:05] <gesho> Frogzoo: any idea what the problem is?
[07:05] <mdeboer> rajeev: what does 'ls /proc/asound' tell you?
[07:05] <gesho> a lot of people have mouse problems
[07:05] <Frogzoo> gesho: you should get garbage output - if that doesn't work - nothing will as that's a raw read of the device
[07:05] <selinium> rajeev: also do as mdeboer says     ls /proc/sound   in a terminal
[07:05] <tahorg> gesho: I don't think so

[07:23] <VR_> oh ok
[07:23] <VR_> Blue89: no go

[07:25] <kOpter> Yello, does anyone know a good ubuntu alternative for Tag & Rename?
[07:25] <Blue89> it's pretty sweet but it' s a pain to memorize that stuff in the beginning

[07:26] <rajeev> hi all , i m here rajeev and i have a few problems with my sound in ubuntu,i have the intel915glvg with integrated realtek soundcard..but i m not getting the sound in my system any one is here to help me plzzz
[07:26] <VR_> another question i had is, i was gonna buy a new, larger HD. would ubuntu automatically recognize that?
[07:26] <VR_> an internal one.
[07:26] <krio> i've just installed xubuntu  on my old notebook (toshiba satellite 2520CDT)...it works but the dyspley resolution is too low...how can i configure display and set it to 800x600?
[07:27] <Frogzoo> VR_: you'll need to partion & format the drive, then update /etc/fstab
[07:27] <Blue89> it will be recognized as hardware, but will not be on filesystem untill you do what Frogzoo said
[07:28] <VR_> how would i update fstab?
[07:28] <Frogzoo> VR_: sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[07:28] <Blue89> type this in console: nano /etc/fstab
[07:28] <kOpter> Yello, does anyone know a good linux alternative for Tag & Rename?
[07:28] <Blue89> oh, I forgot the sudo :-/
[07:29] <VR_> thanks
[07:29] <mr2driver> Hi guys.  Just installed ubuntu and SCIM.  Does anyone know how to use SCIM in FireFox?

[07:35] <frank_> javiolo: I suggest you wait a week then upgrade to 6.6

[07:37] <ajo> hi any advice on the best IM to use wit webcams?
[07:37] <mr2driver> lemsxl, I'm having trouble using SCIM in FireFox.  Need help.
[07:37] <ompaul> tuxtheslacker, my answer was :settings preferences marker line iuf you want to remind
[07:37] <ompaul> tuxmaniac, :-)
[07:37] <lemsx1> mr2driver: ahhh, scim the input stuff... i never use that. i'd suggest installing a language pack for firefox
[07:38] <Frogzoo> javiolo: read the pm from ubotu
[07:38] <tuxtheslacker> ompaul, I don't think that was to me...
[07:38] <tuxtheslacker> oh, nvm.
[07:38] <tuxtheslacker> :-D
[07:38] <javiolo> its just typing sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[07:38] <lemsx1> mr2driver: and killing it ;-) pkill firefox
[07:38] <javiolo> frogzoo I read it but the link doesnt exist
[07:38] <Flannel> richiefrich: I am here now.
[07:38] <lemsx1> mr2driver: and firefox-bin: pkill firefix-bin
[07:38] <frank_> javiolo: you have to modify sources.list before the dist-upgrade
[07:38] <javiolo> This page does not exist yet.
[07:38] <javiolo> ok
[07:38] <frank_> !upgrade
[07:38] <ubotu> I guess upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.

[07:41] <jakub_> yea :)
[07:41] <meherenOS-X> distanceisdeath, do a normal install and when it comes to option format hd choose resize partions and use available free space
[07:41] <kroiz> distanceisdeath, just do it.

[07:41] <meherenOS-X> YoussedAssad, what about it..?
[07:41] <kroiz> distanceisdeath, it the installer will take care of everything
[07:41] <YoussefAssad> meherenOS-X: try making that say EndSection instead
[07:42] <meherenOS-X> ah i see
[07:42] <jakub_> hm, i see ton ;P
[07:42] <YoussefAssad> meherenOS-X: sorry, leave it. ADD an EndSection after it

[07:49] <Mortal`> thoreauputic, it works now. But can't I run Audacity and Skype simultaneous?

[07:50] <woodgrain> * !email
[07:50] <ShereKhanu> where cand i find cedega free ?>:)
[07:50] <thoreauputic> Mortal`: skype grans the sound device
[07:50] <Mortal`> thoreauputic, ah, that's sad. Isn't there a workaround?
[07:50] <Blue89> Mortal`, I didn't need to, so I have no clue how, but you can install a software mixer to fix this problem
[07:50] <thoreauputic> bah s/grans/grabs
[07:50] <Flannel> ShereKhanu: you cant.
[07:50] <ShereKhanu> there a list somewhere with what games work with wine ??
[07:51] <Flannel> ShereKhanu: the wine website has one
[07:51] <Mortal`> Blue89 / thoreauputic, just what I thought of. Thanks you two.
[07:51] <woodgrain> Hi, can someone recommend an email program??
[07:51] <Frogzoo> ShereKhanu: -> appdb.winehq.org
[07:51] <thoreauputic> Mortal`: there's a sound grabber hack someone did to fool skype
[07:51] <Wolf> TRUE
[07:51] <Mortal`> thoreauputic, I'll see if I can find a mixer
[07:51] <ShereKhanu> tnx u
[07:51] <Frogzoo> yw
[07:51] <thoreauputic> Mortal`: skype is closed source so we can't really do much about it
[07:51] <distanceisdeath> does anyone know about a program called "instlux"?
[07:52] <Mortal`> thoreauputic, blue89 said I could search for a software audio mixer
[07:52] <thoreauputic> Mortal`: might be something on the skype wiki page about it
[07:52] <thoreauputic> !skype
[07:52] <ubotu> it has been said that skype is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeHowto/ Breezy deb: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages/
[07:52] <ompaul> Mortal`, there is a dsp hijacker by seveas you should look for that
[07:52] <Mortal`> ompaul, thanks, I'll do that
[07:52] <thoreauputic> ah thanks ompaul - that's what I was trying to remember
[07:53] <Mortal`> Thanks guys
[07:53] <thoreauputic> :)
[07:53] <gesho> Frogzoo, thorg: thanks guys with ps2 mouse
[07:53] <Frogzoo> glad you got a result gesho
[07:53] <rem_> anyone knows what this means in syslog: "VFS: busy inodes on changed media" ..
[07:53] <gesho> yep
[07:53] <gesho> though not done yet
[07:53] <Okay> hio
[07:55] <distanceisdeath> has anyone  ever heard of instlux??
[07:55] <gesho> Frogzoo: when changing xorg.conf to devices: /dev/ttyS0 , I rebooted after that and non of mouses worked. though I played with some other configs too, say ImPS/2 changed to PS/2 3 button emulation to false and some others. definitely machine responds in some way to these, unfortunaltely always crazy
[07:55] <Wolf> what do you guys think of a project to create a google calendar desklet for Gnome that would also integrate with evolution?
[07:55] <gesho> I guess need to try another mouse
[07:55] <Grout58> how does linux manage drivers?
[07:55] <Wolf> it was an idea for Ubuntu SoC 2006
[07:55] <gesho> Frogzoo: do you think that would work?
[07:56] <Frogzoo> gesho: what mouse is this one? now you just need to set the right protocol
[07:56] <MikeStyle> nubuntu isnt picking up my wireless card...NetGear MA401 PCMCIA even after i set it up.....Any thoughts???
[07:56] <thoreauputic> Grout58: Linux has kernel modules - usually they load as needed
[07:56] <krang> anyone know what the current stable release of SASl is?
[07:56] <gesho> protocol1: may be I should try "auto"? i 've seen this in some places
[07:57] <gesho> the mouse is Logitech, there are some specs on the back:: m/n m-m34
[07:57] <thoreauputic> Grout58: please don't msg or dcc without asking
[07:57] <Pyru> Hello I'm new to linux and im just curious on what command would get me themes?

[07:58] <thoreauputic> JoaoJoao: you can, but why?
[07:58] <gesho> 2V 10mA, these kind of stuff...
[07:58] <Grout58> just wanted to ask you a few fundamental linux questions
[07:58] <JoaoJoao> thoreauputic: GRUB doesn't play well with VMWare ESX
[07:58] <thoreauputic> Grout58: just ask in the channel
[07:58] <JoaoJoao> not sure why
[07:58] <thoreauputic> JoaoJoao: ah, I see
[07:58] <gesho> I saw some mouse signal details in help: mouse.
[07:59] <Grout58> ok
[07:59] <Archville> Use Qemu then.
[07:59] <Frogzoo> gesho: try 'ExplorerPS/2' or 'auto'
[07:59] <Grout58> how can you tell if a device has a driver installed like the display driver?
[07:59] <thoreauputic> Grout58: you have a better chance of an answer from 772 people ;-)
[08:00] <thoreauputic> Grout58:  lsmod should tell you
[08:00] <gesho> Frogzoo: okay, I'll try those 2. do u think 3 button emulation should = false? this mouse only has 2 button?
[08:01] <krio> a good c++ compiler for xubuntu?
[08:01] <Ng> gesho: if you only have two buttons, three button emulation is probably a good idea
[08:01] <Ng> krio: g++
[08:01] <JoaoJoao> but how do I tell the Ubuntu installation to use LILO instead of Grub?
[08:01] <krio> tnx a lot :D
[08:01] <Frogzoo> gesho: http://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7.0/doc/html/mouse4.html  but now I have to head, good luck with it
[08:01] <Flannel> JoaoJoao: in expert mode, you can pick lilo
[08:01] <gesho> thanks, have a good day.
[08:02] <Grout58> whats the mod mean in lsmod?
[08:02] <Frogzoo> gesho: cheers, you too
[08:02] <gesho> u were really helpfull
[08:02] <krang> If I'm trying to make an LDAp directory, do i want libsasl2 or libsasl2-dev?
[08:02] <Spec> Grout58: module
[08:02] <Frogzoo> gesho: yw
[08:02] <Grout58> ah thanks just helps me remember
[08:03] <Ng> krang: you only need the -dev package if you want to compile something against that library
[08:03] <Ng> krang: (that holds true for all -dev packages)
=== Frogzoo is now known as Frogsnooze
[08:04] <MikeStyle> nubuntu isnt picking up my wireless card...NetGear MA401 PCMCIA even after i set it up.....Any thoughts???
[08:04] <krang> Ng: So I should perhaps install both just to be safe then?
[08:04] <krang> Ng: One never knows what the future may hold, after all (or the rest of the LDAp-HOWTO, for that matter)
[08:05] <Ng> krang: there's certainly no harm in installing the -dev package :)
[08:05] <krang> Ng: so be it then, thanks!

[08:07] <Stargazers> What?
[08:07] <Aeudian> Question, 2 ubuntu boxes, 1 at work, 1 at home, home does apt-get updates at 1.5MB a sec, while work is "suppost to do 90kb based on connection" but has issues and drops down to 4000bytes a second, both doing same server, what can cause 1 to have a very unreliable speed and other not?

[08:23] <Answer> doped1, gotta log out then log back in
[08:23] <logickid> I've used the ubuntu install cd and followed all the directions, but when i type on my keyboard, the keys i hit don't match what appears
[08:23] <doped1> ok, thnx
[08:23] <gnomefreak> or use ctrl+alt+backspace

[08:24] <gnomefreak> what issue
[08:24] <logickid> where can i give that command?
[08:24] <nalioth> BobC2: do what it asks you to do, and you'll be fixed
[08:25] <Blue89> ctrl-alt-del
[08:25] <TangoDown> gnomefreak: I insert my audigy 2 and the operating system freezes
[08:25] <Blue89> or reboot in terminal
[08:25] <BobC2> nalioth in the terminal?

[08:25] <wisesabre> hello, I need help
[08:25] <nalioth> BobC2: yes, in the terminal
[08:26] <BobC2> nalioth  THANKS!
[08:26] <Answer> logickid, if it recognizes the key presses the driver is probably ok... you might have specified a non us 101 key layout
[08:26] <Blue89> logickid, no you just need to tell it where your keys are by selecting a keymap to match your keys
[08:26] <DShepherd> how do i remove themes that I have installed?
[08:26] <avalost> what sort of themes?
[08:27] <gnomefreak> TangoDown: how many sound cards do you have installed and enabled?

[08:27] <ubotu> sudo is, like, a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[08:27] <wisesabre> how?
[08:27] <gnomefreak> sudo apt-get remove <theme>
[08:27] <wisesabre> ok
[08:27] <gnomefreak> TangoDown: im not real sure
[08:28] <gnomefreak> DShepherd: all depends on how it was installed
[08:28] <Mortal`> How do I escape exclamation marks when doing a cd?
[08:28] <TangoDown> gnomefreak: Neither am I :/ I have tried everything at this point. I figured it was a module issue but I can't seem to figure it out.

[08:28] <DShepherd> manager*
[08:28] <intelikey> !tell wisesabre about gksudo

[08:28] <Answer> TangoDown, sounds to me like an irq conflict
[08:29] <TangoDown> gnomefreak: Would the onboard soundcard being enabled cause the OS to crash?
[08:29] <TangoDown> Answer: Works fine in windows
[08:29] <gnomefreak> if you want to get rid of the tar just open where its saved and right click it move to waste
[08:29] <Mortal`> I have a folder with an exclamation mark in its name, how do I escape it when I need to change to it with cd?
[08:29] <gnomefreak> TangoDown: not sure but i would think if there is a conflict of 2 cards could cause that
=== djk_|away is now known as djk_
[08:30] <Answer> TangoDown, i dunno if windows is relevant, but in general if a device locks up the system it's an irq conflict
[08:30] <Tobbz> meherenOS-X:  you there?

[08:31] <DShepherd> Answer: rm?
[08:31] <Marquinhos> :)
[08:31] <TangoDown> gnomefreak: Hmm Maybe I will post in the forum. Like I said I have tried everything at this point and I haven't found any information on the problem anywhere.
[08:31] <nalioth> BobC2: if you copy and paste the command in the error message (prefaced with 'sudo') it should work
[08:31] <Mortal`> tonyyarusso, Even though it DOES exist >_>
[08:31] <TangoDown> Thanks for the help anyways
[08:31] <krang> Anyone here know which package I should install for Berkeley DB if I want to get LDAP working? There's all sorts of libdb packages available and I'm not sure which one(s) to apt-get
[08:31] <Answer> DShepherd, rm is remove command.
[08:31] <logickid> hey blue, i can't switch the keymap because when i'm at the login screen, ubuntu doesn't recognize the ctrl-alt-del sequence from my keyboard
[08:32] <BobC2> nalioth  Ahhh sudo..thanks I'm such a newbie
[08:32] <intelikey> wisesabre for the newbee on the block.  gtk apps = applications like nautilus which are primarrily GUI apps. as apposed to CLI commands.   linux users by default use a lot of cli.     sudo cp file /dest/dir    or  gksudo nautilus     and use the gui file manager(nautilus)
[08:32] <meherenOS-X> Tobbz, well what's worng?
[08:32] <Marquinhos> algum a fala portugus
[08:32] <DShepherd> Answer: yeah i know.. where are the themes located on the filesystem.  I can them rm from there
[08:32] <Tobbz> meherenOS-X: nevermind.. that was the old conf.. you were missing a EndSection

[08:32] <Tobbz> I can see you have changed it
[08:32] <meherenOS-X> tobbz, i figured that out...
[08:32] <Mortal`> tonyyarusso, without the slash I get "bash: !": event not found" and with the slash I get "bash: cd: My Files\!: No such file or directory
[08:32] <Mortal`> "
[08:32] <tonyyarusso> Mortal`: Did you only type the \! or does it give you that in tab-completion as well?
[08:33] <wisesabre> man isnt there some proper learning material about linux?
[08:33] <Tobbz> meherenOS-X:  sorry if i got your hopes up :)
[08:33] <DShepherd> gnomefreak: that still didnt work
[08:33] <Answer> wisesabre, depends on what you want to learn

[08:34] <logickid> hey guys, how do i switch my keymap if ubuntu doesn't recognize the keys i'm hitting?
[08:34] <tubbie> mplayer works ithout any problem when ging to full screen mode with Xgl
[08:34] <tubbie> :)
[08:34] <BobC2> nalioth  WOW  ..THANKS a LOT!
[08:34] <DShepherd> gnomefreak:  when  I click on it it just loads the theme... so i press delete and then go to another theme. Reopens the theme-manager.. and nothing
[08:35] <Tobbz> meherenOS-X: yea.. im having problems too: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=181355
[08:35] <intelikey> logickid maybe from the console....  X doesn't always use the same keymap as console... you can try it and see.
[08:36] <nalioth> BobC2: you sorted now?
[08:36] <meherenOS-X> yeh not as bad as my probs...
[08:36] <meherenOS-X> lol
[08:36] <Manika> how can I convert movies to mobile's '3gp' under ubuntu?
[08:36] <logickid> intelikey, sorry i'm kind of an idiot, how do i get to the console?
[08:36] <gnomefreak> logickid: applications>accessories>terminal
[08:36] <intelikey> logickid to reach a console try [alt] +[ctrl] +[f1]       note  [alt] +[f7]   is where x is probably running.
[08:37] <BobC2> nalioth  Seems much better now...I will try the update now...
[08:37] <Aeudian> what does "tx_flow_control_pause" mean when you run ethtools -s eth0
[08:37] <intelikey> gnomefreak console not terminal.
[08:37] <BobC2> nalioth Thanks!
[08:37] <gnomefreak> tty
[08:37] <YoussefAssad> logickid: do you need the actual console, or a terminal application will do?
[08:37] <intelikey> yes
[08:37] <JoaoJoao> hm messing with Windows 2003 right now, it's not bad
[08:37] <logickid> the thing is my keyboard doesn't recognize alt+ctrl+f1, and i can't even sign into ubuntu because i can't find all the right keys
[08:38] <intelikey> logickid ah i see.   what language ?
[08:38] <logickid> when i installed, the keyboard layout i specified was American English
[08:38] <hanasaki> what will show me what is actively doing disk io? like top does for cpu load
[08:38] <tuxtheslacker> wow, open office has made some improvements with openoffice 2...

[08:38] <YoussefAssad> tuxtheslacker: yes, the suckage is better hidden
[08:38] <meherenOS-X> http://pastebin.com/735537 ~my Xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/735540 my Xorg.0.log file any ideas suggestions on why it won't work?
[08:38] <tuxtheslacker> ubuntu is kicking tail compared to fedora.
[08:39] <YoussefAssad> meherenOS-X: still?
[08:39] <tuxtheslacker> YoussefAssad, that's a good way of phrasing it, but it's making some leeway.
[08:39] <meherenOS-X> YoussefAssad, only 1 week of wasted time on this damn machine
[08:39] <nalioth> BobC2: close ALL your dpgk, apt-get or synaptic (or just restart the machine)
[08:39] <nalioth> BobC2: er, dpkg, i meant
[08:39] <apokryphos> restarting is a bit of a bad alternative :P
[08:39] <apokryphos> really shouldn't be needed
[08:39] <t35t0r> the installer should ask what sort of languages i want to install
[08:39] <logickid> when i bootup should i enter the commandline instead?
[08:39] <terunshine> hello all the peoplz
[08:39] <t35t0r> it looks like it's installing everything
[08:40] <t35t0r> why does it do that?
[08:40] <terunshine> do you speak french?
[08:40] <t35t0r> i don't need telegu and malayalalam
[08:40] <gato> oi

[08:41] <meherenOS-X> how would i find out?
[08:41] <gato> tc on
[08:41] <t35t0r> tuxtheslacker, this is a new install
[08:41] <tuxtheslacker> t35t0r, no, the language should've been a choice.
[08:41] <Marquinhos> oi gato

[08:42] <YoussefAssad> tuxtheslacker: he's got a radeon?
[08:42] <tuxtheslacker> he said that....
[08:42] <intelikey> logickid reboot,  press [esc]  E edit the kernel line, adding   init=/bin/bash   added to the kernel line.    then  do  mount -o remount,rw / && dpkg-reconfigure locales && mount -o remount,ro       [ctrl] +[alt] +[del]        better take notes.   i can't promise you that that will fix it, but it's a good shot.

[08:49] <OlliK> mumbles_laptop: I'm taking the course completely virtually
[08:49] <krang> When openldap says it requires "posix regex software" what does it mean? Er, do I have it if grep works?
[08:49] <gnomefreak> Answer: apt-cache works too
[08:49] <Answer> gnomefreak, but where are the tcl library packages?

[08:49] <tuxtheslacker> can someone tell me what the package name is for kernel development?
[08:49] <YoussefAssad> meherenOS-X: Alright. I suggest you try disabling in your xorg.conf file the generic monitor. That'd mean commenting out lines 111-140 in your xorg.conf and then seeing how it goes
[08:49] <gnomefreak> Answer: use apt-cache search
[08:49] <mumbles_laptop> OlliK,  is the cisco.netacad.net site slow fo ryou ?

[08:51] <nalioth> intelikey: g-anything is pretty much assumed to be gtk
[08:51] <gnomefreak> !kernel-source
[08:51] <gnomefreak> !+kernel-source
[08:51] <ubotu> it has been said that kernel-source is if you need to install the kernel source for your running kernel, sudo apt-get install linux-source-$(uname -r), more than likely though, all you need is to install the kernel headers for your running kernel. (if you need to compile a module) sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[08:51] <meherenOS-X> YoussedAssad, same error
[08:51] <meherenOS-X> or basically the log says exactly the same thing

[09:11] <rajeev> dli, while running the command alsamixer its says that alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
[09:12] <madcat> I already tried 5 different How Tos
[09:12] <gnomefreak> tuxtheslacker: all you need is the linux-headers package if you have that you need to start building the modules did you install build-essential?
[09:12] <FariSS> hi all , im planing to start learning C# and java but i think i need to install environement on my ubuntu for that , what i have to do please ??
[09:12] <Mortal`> Hey all. I've set /etc/apt/sources.list to download from http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/dists/breezy-seveas/. It seems to get a list when I press "Refresh", but there isn't any software. On http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/dists/breezy-seveas/ I get "Access denied" when trying to see the contents of the sections.
[09:12] <madcat> I tried the one in Ubuntuforums.org... and it just won't work
[09:12] <madcat> =(
[09:12] <logickid> intelikey, wait i typed "mount -o remount, ro /" , and now it says "/dev/hda1 on / type ext3 (rw)"
[09:12] <intelikey> logickid yeah but if you did the mount command and it didn't change.... it's reading /etc/mtab  and reporting the state  but can't update it  because it is ro.   youre good to go.
[09:12] <tuxtheslacker> gnomefreak, what is build essential?
[09:12] <FariSS> hi all , im planing to start learning C# and java but i think i need to install environement on my ubuntu for that , what i have to do please ??
[09:12] <intelikey> no no space. logickid
[09:12] <FariSS> !!!
[09:12] <ubotu> FariSS: Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[09:12] <logickid> doh
[09:12] <gnomefreak> tuxtheslacker: its a meta package of things you ned to build/compile something
[09:13] <logickid> intelikey, how do i change it back
[09:13] <gnomefreak> !b-e
[09:13] <ubotu> or if you get errors saying gcc cannot create executables, or that you can't find header files like stdio.h, or get "make: command not found, then you need to do a    sudo apt-get install build-essential.
[09:13] <intelikey> logickid do this.   mount -o remount,ro /
[09:13] <tuxtheslacker> gnomefreak, apt-get install build-essential?
[09:13] <gnomefreak> tuxtheslacker: yes
[09:13] <tuxtheslacker> welp, I didn't do that yet apparently :-P
[09:13] <tuxtheslacker> hopefully that fixes it :-)

[09:48] <defrysk> t35t0r, nope hes right
[09:48] <rajeev> gnomefreak, after that wat i have to do?
[09:48] <t35t0r> who is he to decide what people think ?
[09:48] <ephesius> the micro sucked and sound stopped working so i took out the card
[09:48] <thoreauputic> t35t0r: actually it was the glxgears devs
[09:48] <t35t0r> defrysk, i know he is right ..i'll have to add an alias
[09:48] <chavo> Im getting 367227 frames in 5.0 seconds = 73445.359 FPS
[09:48] <defrysk> t35t0r, Jeff Waugh is Always Right ;)
[09:48] <ephesius> the headphone jack broke
[09:48] <CrippsFX> !asshat
[09:48] <ubotu> Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, CrippsFX
[09:48] <crimsun> defrysk: err, no, Jeff didn't do that.
[09:48] <CrippsFX> dang.
[09:48] <gnomefreak> rajeev: just ping crimsun with the info you have
[09:49] <thoreauputic> t35t0r: Jeff isn't what you said, BTW
[09:49] <defrysk> crimsun, thats why I said I believe
[09:49] <thoreauputic> t35t0r: and I suggestyou read the codeof conduct
[09:49] <defrysk> was not sure
[09:49] <ephesius> try and buy one off ebay people probably had the same problem as me considering it happened three times and was repaired twice
[09:49] <CrippsFX> what file sets the $PATH variable at startup/login?
[09:49] <thoreauputic> !coc
[09:49] <ubotu> coc is probably the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, which we ask all Ubuntu users to follow. You can find the Code of Conduct at http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/
[09:49] <ephesius> CrippsFX: do you know if i can install to it?
[09:49] <defrysk> who added the flag crimsun ?
[09:50] <rajeev> gnomefreak, its open an editor after that command
[09:50] <CrippsFX> ephesius, install to the cf card? what are you trying to install, and how?
[09:50] <rajeev> gnomefreak, ok i m pinging crimsun
[09:50] <gnomefreak> rajeev: it shouldnt have it should have ran a bunch of output
[09:50] <Heath> Hey how do I change the header and topic for an IRC channel?
[09:51] <NickGarvey> /t
[09:51] <NickGarvey> nope
[09:51] <defrysk> Heath, become op
[09:51] <Heath> ?? Step by step?
[09:51] <ephesius> ubuntu server install, off the cd, the cf card is hooked up through an internal usb card reader that came with the computer, it lets me partition it but for some reason when debian installed grub to a floppy it gives me boot errors
[09:51] <CrippsFX> Heath, /topic "message" ... if you're an op
[09:51] <rajeev> crimsun : i didnt get the sound after running the command which u had given me..:(
[09:51] <Heath> Ty
[09:51] <Heath> How about Header?
[09:51] <_antix> there is no header.
[09:51] <defrysk> rajeev, quick question , do you have a build in sound card ?
[09:52] <crimsun> rajeev: pastebin ``cat /proc/asound/{version,cards}''
[09:52] <Heath> You can change the thing that says you are now talking on right?
[09:52] <rajeev> defrysk, yes
[09:52] <gnomefreak> defrysk: its an intel iirc
[09:52] <t35t0r> in synaptic if something says (dummy package) is that really not a package or what?
[09:52] <defrysk> rajeev, and use it too ?
[09:52] <CrippsFX> ephesius, I see. Well ... is it already installed on the cf card and you're trying to boot, or have you partitioned via debian and the ubuntu install won't let you install it?
[09:52] <mribas> k
[09:52] <_antix> Heath: that's in your client
[09:52] <crimsun> it's an HDA intel that uses the realtek/analog codec
[09:52] <t35t0r> e.g. revtex4
[09:52] <mribas> holaaaaaaa
[09:52] <Heath> _antix: Thanks I appreciate the help ^_^
[09:53] <crimsun> too many darned issues escalating simultaneously
[09:53] <mribas> hola
[09:53] <NickGarvey> I'm starting to hate suse..
[09:53] <mribas> hola
[09:53] <ephesius> CrippsFX: i installed debian and it wouldnt work correctly, now im installing ubuntu, i reformatted the thing and the install is going i was just wondering if it would work
[09:53] <NickGarvey> !tell mribas about es
[09:54] <blenda> NickGarvey: too slow ;-)
[09:54] <ephesius> CrippsFX: or if it should work
[09:54] <rajeev> crimsun , here is the pastebin of that http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14606
[09:54] <ephesius> CrippsFX: i guess i should install it first, then go from there
[09:54] <CrippsFX> ephesius, if the install is going correctly, then with the proper grub configuration, I don't see why it wouldn't work.
[09:54] <CrippsFX> :)
[09:54] <JoaoJoao> anyone here manage to have Ubuntu 5.10 working with VMWare ESX and the vmxnet driver?
[09:55] <NickGarvey> !justask
[09:55] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[09:55] <ephesius> CrippsFX: i dont know how to install grub or configure it
[09:55] <crimsun> rajeev: ``lsmod''
[09:55] <ephesius> CrippsFX: how should i install grub
[09:55] <Insup> does anyone here have any experience on installing cedega on an amd64 pc?
[09:55] <NickGarvey> !anyone
[09:55] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? </hint>
[09:56] <semq> hi noob here
[09:56] <_antix> !noob
[09:56] <ubotu> I guess noob is a four letter word, just like rtfm or jfgi. Don't use it
[09:56] <_antix> sorry, seemed lke a trend...
[09:56] <NickGarvey> he was calling himself a noob.. not an insult..
[09:56] <CrippsFX> ephesius, do you have anything installed on your primrary master Hard Drive (IDE) ?
[09:56] <cdubya> heh
[09:56] <Ng> Insup: only briefly and I had some problems with the 32bit GL nvidia libraries, but it was a while ago
[09:56] <_antix> I know, I just wanted to type it. didnt' realize ubotu even knew it.
[09:56] <JoaoJoao> well I'm sure only someone that used Ubuntu with ESX can really help me
[09:56] <CzarAlex`> Good Afternoon. If I would like changes to proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range to remain AFTER I reboot, where would I need to write them? (I heard they don't remain in proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range after restarting)
[09:56] <semq> how can i join an irc channel please?
[09:56] <Insup> I have it installed, but having probs with 32bit libraries too
[09:56] <NickGarvey> _antix: oh heh ;)
[09:56] <semq> this: irc://irc.gamesurge.net/Hamachi-Games.net
[09:56] <NickGarvey> semq: /join #channel
[09:57] <nubix> hello
[09:57] <_antix> semq: you must be joking
[09:57] <NickGarvey> semq: /server irc.gamesurge.net
[09:57] <rajeev> crimsun, did u want the output of that if yes then it is here...http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14607
[09:57] <NickGarvey> semq: then /join #hamachi-games.net
[09:57] <nubix> why is ubuntu so easy to break and so hard to fix?
[09:57] <t35t0r> 'eh no acroread? in universe or multiverse?
[09:57] <Pyru> anyone help me out with my panels please im new to linux
[09:57] <semq> ty
[09:57] <ephesius> CrippsFX: my hard drive is unplugged completely, the only thing on the ide channel is the cdrom....my step-dad is trying to save power and wants me to try this out instead, it seems like a cool idea as well
[09:57] <NickGarvey> nubix: I disagree
[09:57] <cdubya> Pyru, just ask. :)
[09:58] <NickGarvey> nubix: never broke with me actually
[09:58] <gdb> nubix: I disagree, too, and I've been using it all of a week.
[09:58] <CzarAlex`> nubix, Ive been using it for almost a year. Just dont break it :)
[09:58] <cdubya> nubix, been using it for awhile, hasn't broke yet
[09:58] <nubix> i used it about a week and then i tried installing different video drivers and now all i get is a terminal
[09:58] <JoaoJoao> broke with me when I mixed universe, breezy, debian sources and some other sources :)
[09:58] <nubix> i used synaptic package manager too
[09:58] <NickGarvey> nubix: ok.. so you messed up your drivers.. don't blame the distro..
[09:58] <crimsun> rajeev: the wrong driver is loaded.
[09:58] <NickGarvey> nubix: easy to fix...
[09:58] <ephesius> CrippsFX: also the card reader isnt hooked up through a usb cable externally, the usb cable goes right into the mobo but it is installed correctly
[09:58] <nubix> so without being in gnome i have no idea how to uninstall
[09:59] <CrippsFX> ephesius, does sound like a cool idea ... although, the power savings from unplugging a Hard drive (unless you're running a server with RAID) is minimal ....
[09:59] <gdb> JoaoJoao: i poured sand in my gas tank and my car went boom :-(
[09:59] <cdubya> heh
[09:59] <gdb> JoaoJoao: hehe ;-)
[09:59] <NickGarvey> !X
[09:59] <JoaoJoao> haha :)
[09:59] <ubotu> from memory, x is a portable, network-transparent window system.
[09:59] <ephesius> hahaha
[09:59] <NickGarvey> !x11
[09:59] <ubotu> x11 is probably a protocol used by X servers and clients  X11 stands for the eleventh version of the X window system.
[09:59] <NickGarvey> damn it
[09:59] <NickGarvey> whats the factoid for reconfiguring X?
[09:59] <rajeev> crimsun, so how can i get the correct driver?
[09:59] <Tonren> calc multilib
[09:59] <JoaoJoao> damn ESX :(
[09:59] <crimsun> rajeev: ``sudo modprobe -r snd_intel8x0 snd_opl3_lib snd_rawmidi && sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel''
[09:59] <JoaoJoao> the vmxnet driver *loads*, but it doesn't work
[09:59] <nubix> i haven't gotten any help here so it must be complicated
[09:59] <CrippsFX> ephesius, it *should* boot off of something like: (sd0,0) assuming ubuntu is on the first partition of your cf ... and since all you have available is floppy to install grub onto ... I'd say give it a shot.
[10:00] <Tonren> Hey!!  ubotu!!
[10:00] <NickGarvey> nubix: wait please, I'm looking it up
[10:00] <gdb> dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
[10:00] <Pyru> I am having trouble getting my programs to minimize to a tray icon like they did before, i removed a divider thing on the top panel which was where the programs minimized to a tray icon upon click the x button in the window, can someone help me get that working again please!
[10:00] <gdb> iirc
[10:00] <CrippsFX> NickGarvey, dpkg --reconfigure xorg
[10:00] <NickGarvey> !xorg
[10:00] <ubotu> I heard xorg is To reconfigure your X server, type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" in a terminal, or check here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto or here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-83973.html
[10:00] <CrippsFX> NickGarvey, or dpkg --configure xorg ... I can't remember
[10:00] <NickGarvey> ha you were both wrong
[10:00] <nubix> gdb: i tried that already and it says "xserver-xorg is broken or not fully installed"
[10:00] <yonatan> hi there, can anyone help with 64bit ati woes please? the wiki etc.. refers to a file that doesn't exist on my system.... =(
[10:00] <gdb> I wasn't wrong.  Unless skipping the assumed sudo part makes me wrong. :-(
[10:01] <ephesius> CrippsFX: the only thing different from a normal install is that i should install grub to /dev/fd0 instead of the mbr right?
[10:01] <CrippsFX> NickGarvey, something I picked up using debian years back ... but then it was XFree86 ... ;)
[10:01] <umarmung> Pyru: right click the panel and add the applet notification area again
[10:01] <NickGarvey> CrippsFX: ;)
[10:01] <gdb> nubix: There's a dpkg command to complete / fix the partial installation, it's in the dpkg man page, I don't remember it offhand.
[10:01] <Tonren> hey, what's the command to ask Ubotu about something?
[10:01] <rajeev> crimsun, its says  Module snd_rawmidi is in use.
[10:01] <CrippsFX> ephesius, something like that, yeah.
[10:01] <NickGarvey> GdB: you did it backwards silly, xserver-xorg, not xorg-xserver
[10:01] <Pyru> umarmung, I did that but still when i click the x on say amsn it just minimizes to a window on the bottom panel
[10:01] <gdb> But it's pretty explicitly identified "Caused dpkg to repair to complete a partial installation" or something alone those lines.
[10:01] <crimsun> rajeev: sudo modprobe -r snd_mpu401_uart
[10:01] <Pyru> before it minimized to a tray icon on the top panel
[10:02] <CrippsFX> NickGarvey, ah well ... i tried ... I'm allowed to forget debian specific tools after 3 or 4 years ;)
[10:02] <gdb> NickGarvey: Doh!
[10:02] <Tonren> !calc multilib
[10:02] <ubotu> NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Tonren
[10:02] <twibbler> Good evening everybody
[10:02] <NickGarvey> twibbler: evening
[10:03] <umarmung> Pyru: no idea, i don't use amsn. do other icons show up in the notification area, like the update notifier?
[10:03] <NickGarvey> I can't wait till june 1st.. going to throw suse out the door ;)
[10:03] <ephesius> CrippsFX: its installing now....my board is usb 1.1 so its taking a little bit haha but ill tell you how it turns out
[10:03] <sovieticool> hy all
[10:03] <rajeev> crimsun , sudo modprobe -r snd_mpu401_uart and sudo modprobe -r snd_mpu401_uart these two get executed
[10:03] <sovieticool> some ideas how to enable 5.1 sistem ?
[10:03] <Pyru> umarmung, nope , frostwire used to minimize to that try as well now it just exits
[10:03] <gdb> NickGarvey: What does SuSE provide now that Ubuntu doesn't?  Just an older set of packages in Ubuntu currently?
[10:04] <crimsun> rajeev: ...that's the same command. Anyhow, does ``sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel'' return immediately to a prompt?
[10:04] <CrippsFX> ephesius, good man. I'm curious to know, because one of my "pet projects" is making a computer with no moving parts, under a low budget :P
[10:04] <Answer> gdb, you would have to compare SuSE and Debian
[10:04] <Tonren> hey, anyone know about multilib?
[10:04] <CrippsFX> ... another one is finding alternate low-budget cooling methods.
[10:04] <rajeev> crimsun, yes
[10:04] <CrippsFX> ... and another is making an old palm pilot into a usb flash-drive powered FLAC player ...
[10:05] <Sub> CrippsFX, all passive cooling and flash memory, no optical drives?
[10:05] <CrippsFX> ... and another one is ........
[10:05] <twibbler> Does anybody now anything about setting up USB printer on laptop. Im having a bit of a nightmare.
[10:05] <crimsun> rajeev: now pastebin ``cat /proc/asound/cards && amixer''
[10:05] <CrippsFX> Sub, nope. passive cooling won't work. still has moving parts. although you are right about the flash memory.
[10:05] <heatxsink> has anyone upgraded debian to ubuntu?
[10:05] <Tonren> twibbler: is it HP?
[10:05] <Sub> CrippsFX, a big heatsink does not have moving parts.
[10:06] <gdb> Answer: Why's that?  It's been made pretty clear that while Ubuntu draws from and contributes to Debian, Ubuntu != Debian.  So if I'm interested in a SuSE vs. Ubuntu comparison, what does Debian have to do with it?
[10:06] <ephesius> CrippsFX: One more question do you think i can take the fan off the top of the cpu heatsink, or atleast unplug it? cuz that would bring down the noise a bunch and it seems like it would work ok....
[10:06] <twibbler> Tonren: Nope a canon, with good documentation but it wont work.
[10:06] <Sub> I could do it with a mini-atx, and an IDE->Compact Flash converter
[10:06] <Sub> since there is a mini atx board with passive cooling
[10:06] <Tonren> hmm...
[10:06] <CrippsFX> heatxsink, haven't done it, but based on apt-get, I would think that it can be done. just rebuild your /etc/apt/sources.list , run an "apt-get update" and do "apt-get dist upgrade"
[10:06] <rajeev> crimsun: here it is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14608
[10:07] <heatxsink> CrippsFX: I did just that now I'm getting package conflicts
[10:07] <CrippsFX> ephesius, I wouldn't suggest it, but it does depend on your processor.
[10:07] <ephesius> Sub: the only thing is those mini-itx boards are pricy, he wants low-budget
[10:07] <crimsun> rajeev: ``ls -l /dev/snd''
[10:07] <Sub> ephesius, not if your cpu is faster than about 500mhz, itd fry VERY quickly
[10:07] <allan__> hi... im making a collection of tools to distribute on a CD. can anyone point me to a resource on the net that can help me make a repository on the CD for the deps Please?
[10:07] <twibbler> Tonren: the problem is Im using a docking station, and laptop seems to be some sort of coms problem somewhere. Ive installed driver followed all ins, it finds it on lsusb but wont print the test page goes into the balck holw.
[10:07] <ephesius> CrippsFX: its a celeron at 1.7 haha
[10:08] <CrippsFX> heatxsink, could tell it to force installation, or remove the conflicting packages ... that might be worthy of some form of script ...
[10:08] <ephesius> i dont think i will
[10:08] <CrippsFX> ephesius, I wouldn't suggest it then.
[10:08] <Sub> ephesius, use an old cpu/mobo that does not require a fan?
[10:08] <CrippsFX> yeah ... I wouldn't even do that to a Celly 700MHz
[10:08] <rajeev> crimsun: its says ls: /dev/snd: No such file or directory
[10:08] <Sub> itz be like 400mhz... prob run DSL okay,
[10:08] <heatxsink> how do I get the gpg keys for security
[10:08] <CrippsFX> Sub, 486/100MHz ?
[10:08] <Tonren> twibbler: bizarre... is there a working print monitor/manager software that installed w/ the driver?
[10:08] <ephesius> ill check if i have one
[10:08] <CrippsFX> ;)
[10:08] <heatxsink> and archive
[10:08] <Sub> CrippsFX, DSL will run on a 486 :D
[10:08] <allan__> how does one make cdrom based repositories? any ideas? i googled for it and came up with squat
[10:08] <allan__> help
[10:09] <Sub> itll run on my toaster probably.
[10:09] <twibbler> Tonren: nope it says use the admin print configuration tool to setup printer.
[10:09] <CrippsFX> Sub, yeah, but it'll be: "Damn Slow Linux" ;)
[10:09] <Sub> :P
[10:09] <ephesius> haha
=== Davidou is now known as Infinity_akaDavi
[10:09] <twibbler> Tonren: and the driver is there.
=== Infinity_akaDavi is now known as Infinity_Davidou
[10:09] <Tonren> twibbler: if you do print-admin list or whatever the equivalent is, does the job show up?
[10:10] <CrippsFX> ephesius, actually, for going fanless, one of the newer laptop processors would probably be best. they're designed to run cool, and low on ower.
[10:10] <CrippsFX> *power
[10:10] <crimsun> rajeev: ``grep intel /etc/modules''
[10:10] <CrippsFX> ... Unless you want a heatsync the size of your mobo :P
[10:10] <ephesius> Sub: i have been looking into the mini-itx board that don't require cooling
[10:10] <twibbler> Tonren: yes and the little printer top right and it is there printer stopped, or it is there and goes but doesn't print.
[10:10] <sovieticool> i have 5.1 sistem and the subwoofer and center don't work :(
[10:10] <sovieticool> some ideeas ?
[10:10] <crimsun> sovieticool: pastebin ``amixer''
[10:10] <pigor> hi. i have got the ubuntu flight 7 cd. how can i install it? or is it just a live cd?
[10:10] <CrippsFX> ephesius, how much?
[10:10] <ephesius> CrippsFX: its at the grub install...idk what to do
[10:10] <Tonren> hmm....
[10:10] <Sub> ephesius, the best one i can see is here http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/store/motherboards/PD_6000
[10:11] <Sub> 185 dollars though,
[10:11] <twibbler> Tonren: Arrrrrggggggghhhhhhhh
[10:11] <ephesius> yea thats the thing
[10:11] <CrippsFX> ephesius, your root filesystem in on the first partition of the CF right?
[10:11] <rajeev> crimsun, its return to prompt..
[10:11] <twibbler> Its annoying me.
[10:11] <ephesius> yea
[10:11] <crimsun> rajeev: ok, good. Reboot, please.
[10:11] <CrippsFX> ephesius, and you don't have a separate /boot partition, do you?
[10:11] <defrysk> sovieticool, try movies with AC3 5.1 sound ?
[10:11] <crimsun> rajeev: don't manually load any sound drivers.
[10:11] <sovieticool> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14609
[10:11] <ephesius> CrippsFX, i think it setup a /boot partition
[10:12] <NickGarvey> !biztalk
[10:12] <ubotu> NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, NickGarvey
[10:12] <ephesius> CrippsFX, :( grub installed to the mbr automatically
[10:12] <rajeev> crimsun, thnx i m going to reboot lets hope for the best.. ok..
[10:12] <ephesius> CrippsFX, can i reinstall grub from a live cd?
[10:12] <sovieticool> defrysk, i want to play mp3 with xmms
[10:12] <Sub> ephesius, yes
[10:12] <NickGarvey> ephesius: I'm sure it gave you an option, it always does
[10:12] <CrippsFX> ephesius, yeah. you can boot off of a live cd, chroot, and fix everything from there.
[10:12] <defrysk> sovieticool, since when does mp3 do 5.1 ?
[10:12] <sovieticool> and don't work o i have a 5.1 genius sistem
[10:13] <NickGarvey> ephesius: and yes grub can be reinstalled very easily, I do it even for windows only computers
[10:13] <pigor> can i install ubuntu from a flight cd?
[10:13] <defrysk> mp3 = NOT 5.1
[10:13] <ephesius> NickGarvey: nope, didn't, maybe cuz it was on a server install
[10:13] <NickGarvey> pigor: yup
[10:13] <ephesius> how do i install grub to a floppy from a live cd
[10:13] <sovieticool> i don't know but in win work fine
[10:13] <NickGarvey> ephesius: mm.. actually I always do an expert install
[10:13] <CrippsFX> ... but I don't know much about "reinstalling" grub (since I never do it), so you'll have to ask one of the other veterans here ;)
[10:13] <ephesius> i dont understand grub
[10:13] <NickGarvey> ephesius: but I'm pretty sure it does anyway
[10:13] <NickGarvey> !grub
[10:13] <ubotu> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
[10:13] <pigor> NickGarvey: how. in boot menu there is just "start..."

[10:13] <heatxsink> for apt?
[10:14] <CzarAlex`> If I would like changes to proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range to remain AFTER I reboot, where would I need to write them? (I heard they don't remain in proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range after restarting)

[10:14] <defrysk> sovieticool, open alsaconf and see witch channels need to be opened
[10:15] <crimsun> (we don't ship alsaconf)
[10:15] <sovieticool> crimsun, i don;t understand
[10:15] <defrysk> sovieticool, listen to crimsun he knows more then i do
[10:15] <twibbler> Tonren: Any ideas please.
[10:15] <sovieticool> ok
[10:15] <cors> CzarAlex: Have you take a look at "/etc/sysctl.conf" ?
[10:15] <crimsun> sovieticool: in a terminal, type ``amixer'', and paste that output onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[10:15] <Tonren> twibbler: sorry, man... drivers definitely are not my thing.
[10:15] <daoze> i 'd like to configure my wifi connexion, card recognized but what else to do to enable connxion
[10:15] <sovieticool> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14609
[10:15] <CzarAlex`> cors, Yes. What would the line look like that I need to write there?
[10:16] <twibbler> Tonren: thanks anyway Im going to go and throw the laptop of a cliff.
[10:16] <sovieticool> crimsun, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14609
[10:16] <Tonren> twibbler: hahaha, i wouldn't endorse wanton destruction JUST yet.  i'm sure someone will be able to help you
[10:16] <NickGarvey> twibbler: send me the hard drive first, I need a new one
[10:16] <Tonren> NickGarvey: vulture.... ;{
[10:16] <Tonren> err, that was supposed to be a :P
[10:17] <ephesius> NickGarvey, i followed the link the bot spit out but it doesnt say anything about installing to a floppy
[10:17] <twibbler> NickGarvey: Nope im going to take an sledge hammer to it.
[10:17] <Tonren> you know, I never noticed it before, but :{ is definitely a guy with a handlebar moustache
[10:17] <Pyru> hm
[10:17] <Falluccer> what plugin do I use to get sound in opera?
[10:17] <gnomefreak> ephesius: there isnt a way to isntall from floppy that im aware of yet
[10:17] <Tonren> twibbler: have you tried "sudo apt-get install lib-fix-everything"?  XD
[10:18] <gnomefreak> Falluccer: do you have sound at all?
[10:18] <NickGarvey> ephesius: I'd google "grub floppy"
[10:18] <CzarAlex`> cors: I know what values i want to use (15000 25000) but I'm not sure what the actual line should look like
[10:18] <ephesius> ynot install from floppy, to floppy
[10:18] <twibbler> Tonren: nope is that the exact syntax ?.
[10:18] <Falluccer> gnomefreak: yes I do now
[10:18] <Tonren> twibbler: i was joking.  ;P  I WISH there was such a package
[10:18] <defrysk> Falluccer, not sure but to get sound in opera you have to check settings of opera I think
[10:18] <sovieticool> crimsun, some ideeas ?
[10:18] <Falluccer> gnomefreak: I found the right module
[10:18] <gnomefreak> grub you can put on floppy
[10:18] <CzarAlex`> GAG works nicely too.
[10:18] <crimsun> sovieticool: amixer set 'LFE' on && amixer set 'LFE' 80% && amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 0 && amixer set 'IEC958' off
[10:18] <gnomefreak> !grub
[10:18] <ubotu> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
[10:18] <twibbler> Tonren: I guessed but hey I can write a script like that but not sure what it would do.
[10:19] <ephesius> can i put setup /dev/fd0
[10:19] <cors> CzarAlex: net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32000 61000
[10:19] <gnomefreak> ^^^ to put grub on floppy (boot floppy)
[10:19] <CzarAlex`> cors Thank you!!
[10:19] <ephesius> then point it to boot off sda1
[10:19] <Falluccer> is there a quick time plugin?
[10:19] <sovieticool> ok crimsun i will try
[10:19] <Tonren> twibbler: it would probably just ask the user what the problem is, then go to #ubuntu and ask about it
[10:19] <Tonren> !multilib
[10:19] <ubotu> Tonren: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[10:19] <defrysk> !quicktime
[10:19] <ubotu> quicktime is, like, read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information on quicktime support or just install the "libquicktime1" package.
[10:20] <cors> CzarAlex`: It's Google that you should thanks ;-)
[10:20] <CzarAlex`> cors I did google but most of the stuff was for Red Hat and i wasnt sure what was translatable. But thanks
[10:21] <racestoapril1> does anyone know how to make the songs on myspace play through ubuntu? i have 5.04 and the mp3 plugins/lame/etc
[10:22] <crimsun> racestoapril1: using firefox?
[10:22] <racestoapril1> yes
[10:22] <spikeb> i think the myspace songs use either flash or windows media
[10:22] <crimsun> racestoapril1: install alsa-oss from universe, then invoke ``aoss firefox''
[10:22] <FunnyLookinHat> racestoapril1, best way is it install xine and the firefox mplayer plugin or whatever it is
[10:22] <twibbler> Is there a linux printing forum?.
[10:22] <sovieticool> crimsun, from where i can edit amixer ?
[10:22] <FunnyLookinHat> oh wait that's for the movies
[10:22] <crimsun> sovieticool: I gave you the precise command to paste.
[10:22] <defrysk> sovieticool, just copy paste crimsun's txt
[10:22] <sovieticool> oo ok sry
[10:23] <racestoapril1> ok so i need to get the flash plugin?

[10:29] <shizz> well im just getting familar with the threading model and i got some errors when i was compiling. the book that i was following says that i should check the version of threads that is installed and to upgrade to a newer version of NPTL if the copyright says 1996
[10:30] <twibbler> harvey: look at modprobe
[10:30] <HedgeMage> NickGarvey: ???
[10:30] <NickGarvey> HedgeMage: ^^ Jinkguns
[10:30] <Jinkguns> -_-
[10:30] <gnomefreak> /op/opme
[10:30] <shizz> so i checked the pthread.h file and it says that it is a cimple clone of the NPTL and that its from 1196
[10:30] <harvey> twibbler, what am I looking for in modprobe exactly?
[10:30] <NickGarvey> HedgeMage: in caps, hard to miss ;)
[10:31] <shizz> so i think that i have to upgrade for my examples to work
[10:31] <gnomefreak> NickGarvey: ?
[10:31] <NickGarvey> gnomefreak: I think others have it covered, thank you though
[10:31] <HedgeMage> definitely chanop territory, though, not mine
[10:31] <NickGarvey> 16:28:39) Jinkguns: SOME SNOT NOSED LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL SHIT STOLE A PART OF THE TUNNELING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE THAT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO BUILD
[10:31] <shizz> are you there?
[10:31] <twibbler> harvey: when setup ndiswrapper driver you need to modprobe it to keep the driver setup[ for next log in.
[10:31] <HedgeMage> have at it gnomefreak

[10:31] <harvey> Thanks, I'll give it a shot now

[10:45] <nf4> every thing elese seems to be there

[11:00] <ephesius> NickGarvey: does the live cd include make?
[11:00] <FarrisG> except that I can't print PS from mozilla/firefox because it's trying to send 2015 data, and my printer only speaks 2014.116. So I'm using a PCL driver, which works fine on one machine. But on an identical machine with an identical config, the printer still spits out the "wrong PS" error. Why is it sending PS data when I'm using a PCL driver?

[11:29] <eggzeck> jane_, I also want you to know that what I said isn't exactly what it says, but it's close and you'll see it ;)
[11:30] <jane_> eggzeck, thanks
[11:30] <Sharcho> krang, probably. In the future, go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/  and select "Descriptions" in the options.
[11:30] <eggzeck> jane_, that will leave your old partition(s) in tact
[11:30] <joe_> So nobody knows how to make firefox stop using the totem plugin?
[11:30] <eggzeck> joe_, you were already told to remove the totem plugin.
[11:31] <krang> Sharcho: damn. I did all this because I had trouble determining which packages to apt-get
[11:31] <eggzeck> joe_, you also need to restart ff
[11:31] <krang> Sharcho: So now I need to remove all that crap
[11:31] <Rawplayer> how was the ubuntu certification called again?
[11:31] <joe_> eggzeck: I don't even have totem-xine-firefox-plugin, I tried to remove it and it tells me it doesn't exist
[11:31] <Rawplayer> and where can i read about it
[11:32] <Mortal`> Hey all. Is there an application that lets me replace by RegEx in a text file? I've downloaded all text editors available I could find, and they all either don't offer RegEx or only offer RegEx in multiple files by directory...
[11:32] <eggzeck> joe_, so there's NO way your ff plays movies within the browser ;)
[11:32] <eggzeck> joe_, it SHOULD use mozilla-mplayer, you sound confused.
[11:33] <krang> Sharcho: does make clean remove stuff?
[11:33] <Aragorn_Guardian> Mortal`, sed
[11:33] <Aragorn_Guardian> Mortal`, scite in a visual way
[11:33] <Mortal`> Thanks
[11:33] <humbolt> so how far is xen 3.0 support in ubuntu and how the heck do I make use of this?
[11:33] <mscman> joe_ you could try uninstalling totem altogether if you don't use it
[11:33] <joe_> eggzeck: I have mozilla-mplayer installed and totem-xine-firefox-plugin doesn't exist, but when I play media files in firefox it uses totem somehow but tells me it can't play them
[11:34] <humbolt> is there any place that explains xen to a total newbie?
[11:34] <eggzeck> joe_, I don't see how it would do that, if you don't have totem-firefox-plugin
[11:34] <dumaiso> Do anyone knows if there is compiled drivers for intel 537ep modem?
[11:34] <joe_> If I can get totem to actually play anything I'd use it
[11:34] <mscman> try installing totem-xine-firefox-plugin then
[11:35] <Jellman> does any one know how ububtu is doing on the new intel imacs?
[11:35] <Sharcho> krang, you can try "make clean" and "make uninstall"
[11:35] <krang> rightho, will do that now
[11:35] <chavo> Mortal`, kate will let you search using regex
[11:35] <krang> Sharcho: ty again

[12:16] <Pyru> M4Dc47, thats for mozilla etc?
[12:16] <Drake_> ok I noticed that root is in /etc/shadow and in sudoers
[12:16] <M4Dc47> Pyru yes, if it doesn't work, try to update mozilla

[12:21] <Drake_> apparently only root was installed on this box and then the users were added later, I wasn't sure what the default install for ubuntu was suppose to look regarding root. I know that ubuntu isn't suppose to have a "root" for security reasons but apparently it has to have some kind of root ie the sudo root but I wasn't sure why an encrypted password for root was showing up in the /etc/shadow if there wasn't a real "root"

[12:35] <lufis> Gnomefreak, mjr: :( alright, thank you for the link. If there's not a best, which would you recommend for a n00b who wants speed and reliability?
[12:35] <njan> lufis, for general purpose use, ext3 is the "best" based on stability and supportability.
[12:35] <charlesJacobs> lufis: if you're unsure you might as well use ext3
[12:36] <njan> lufis, unless you have very specific needs it makes no sense to go for anything else.
[12:36] <lufis> Njan, charlesjacobss: ok, thanks
[12:37] <hollywoodb> I use ext2 for backup partitions, due to the fact that ext2 data recovery tools don't work for ext3.  if you delete a file on ext3, its gone

[12:37] <mjr> jen1020, you do know that the wannabe-insults you're sending through ubotu identify you as the sender, don't you?
[12:37] <gnomefreak> it might be vim

[12:38] <gnomefreak> zaoueche: join #ubuntu-fr
[12:38] <zaoueche> ok genome thx
[12:38] <njan> hollywoodb, whereas running using ext3 means your backup partition actulaly has journalling and is therefore slightly more graceful if you have a powerfailure or similar.

[12:38] <tim_> njan: so i have to type: sudo mv DESTINATION SOURCE
[12:38] <njan> tim_, man mv
[12:39] <mjr> Larsson-Sweden, not all cards/drivers support overlay (xv) on tv-out. Just don't use it if you're in such a situation...
[12:39] <njan> tim_, man tells you all you need to know :)
[12:39] <tim_> njan: yeah i did that but its confusing
[12:39] <charlesJacobs> tim_: it's source destination
[12:39] <njan> no it isn't
[12:39] <hollywoodb> njan: true.  my problem is that ext3 zeroes inodes upon file deletion, so if by chance you needed to recover it you'd have to grep the disk, which is a faulty as it sounds
[12:39] <njan> tim_, one of the first lines on the manpage is        mv [OPTION] ... SOURCE DEST
[12:39] <njan> tim_, how is that confusing?
[12:39] <Misto> Is there no root account in ubuntu?
[12:40] <Flannel> !tell Misto about root
[12:40] <mjr> Misto, there is, you can't login as it by default, though
[12:40] <tim_> Njan: yeah does that mean? what goes first, dest or directory
[12:40] <charlesJacobs> njan: wait.. doesn't that contradict with what you were saying?
[12:40] <gnomefreak> tim_: use cp please "cp /path/to/file /path/to/where/you/want/it"
[12:40] <Misto> Okay, mjr! That and Flannel's response did help.
[12:41] <Larsson-Sweden> mjr, problem is that other drivers have tearing. When using vidix or XV the tearing is gone, thats why i want to use XV. Vidix works fine with vesa driver tough.
[12:41] <njan> charlesJacobs, not really, I never said ext3 had no disadvantages.
[12:41] <njan> charlesJacobs, but last I looked there are data recovery tools for ext3, and if you're properly administrating a system you should never accidentally delete backups, so journaling is more of an issue. Like all things, it's all about priorities ;)
[12:41] <mjr> Larsson-Sweden, second-hand info: some cards may only do xv on their primary display. See if you can set the tv to be the primary somehow

[12:46] <njan> tim_, you need to copy in recursive mode
[12:46] <njan> tim_, again, the man page is enlightening ;)
[12:47] <charlesJacobs> tim_: yeah. cp -R
[12:47] <tim_> njan: i want to copy the contents of a folder and put them in another folder
[12:47] <njan> cp -rv ./folder/* /path/to/other/folder/
[12:48] <hollywoodb> astrisk: what's the link to your forum post?
[12:48] <njan> tim_, I'm not trying to insult you by pointing at manpages.. it's just something about fish, and teaching, and lifetimes.
[12:48] <Misto> !tell Misto about mp3
[12:48] <njan> tim_, manpages and google can answer 95% of linux-related queries within about 2 minutes.
[12:48] <charlesJacobs> tim_: he's right. and manpages rofflepwn
[12:48] <njan> that and the 'info' command for this crazy hippy gnu stuff ;)
[12:49] <charlesJacobs> HURD!!!
[12:50] <tim_> njan: hallelujah. thanks
[12:50] <kidtux> Solaris 7!
[12:50] <Manika> charlesJacobs: ok but now I'll have to repair it? I can't believe linux corrupted my phone...
[12:51] <charlesJacobs> Manika: I can't really say. sony probably has some way to flash it. I have the same phone but I've never tried connecting it to my linux computer. doesn't it come with a disk?
[12:51] <Bilford> another helpful tool is to add Ubuntu Forums search plugin for the FF search bar
[12:51] <Manika> charlesJacobs: yes but the software is for windows
[12:52] <charlesJacobs> Manika: have you tried running it in wine?
[12:52] <Manika> I'm doing it on vmware right now to see if I can reset the phone..
[12:53] <Manika> charlesJacobs, I'm doing it on vmware right now to see if I can reset the phone..

[12:59] <Flannel> erm, sorry.  O
[12:59] <hollywoodb> ReWT_AxS: when you ctrl-X to exit it will also ask if you want to save... Flannel *meant* ctrl-O I believe
[12:59] <charlesJacobs> ReWT_AxS: ctrl+q will prompt you to save before quit
[12:59] <Flannel> "write Out"

[01:03] <Larsson-Sweden> When using the XV video driver, there is only a black picture on my TV. Using fglrx.
[01:03] <kidtux> How about Ubuntu-Sparc??? :-)
[01:03] <yoyoyo> will it screw up my computer by removing ubuntu-desktop in synaptic
[01:04] <eggzeck> You won't have a gui (basically)
=== soop__ is now known as soop
[01:04] <yoyoyo> eggzeck- i thought the gui was gnome
[01:05] <Larsson-Sweden> When using video driver GL2, there is tearing in the picture. Can this be removed?
[01:05] <eggzeck> yoyoyo, gnome is included in ubuntu-desktop ;)
[01:05] <yoyoyo> eggzeck- will it like delete everything that came with my ubuntu setup?
[01:06] <Flannel> yoyoyo: no.  "ubuntu-desktop" is a metapackage
[01:06] <yoyoyo> flannel: i want to remove totem and its asking me to remove ubuntu-desktop
[01:07] <yoyoyo> flannel: will that screw up my programs
[01:07] <Flannel> yoyoyo: nope, ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage.
[01:07] <theCore> what is the package that provide iwlist?
[01:07] <Manika> charlesJacobs: yeah fixed the phone :) linux created a 'trash' folder inside the phone. windows detected it, I deleted, and it worked :)
[01:07] <yoyoyo> flannel: whats the difference between a metapackage and just a regular one
[01:08] <Flannel> yoyoyo: a meta package doesn't contain anything, EXCEPT for dependencies.
[01:08] <yoyoyo> flannel: so by synaptic removing it im not screwing up anything
[01:08] <Flannel> yoyoyo: so, they make installation easy, instead of having to install each component of ubuntu, you can just install "ubuntu-desktop" and get all of them.
[01:08] <twb> I have a k8 sempron using the i386 install.  Can/should I use a -686 kernel instead of a -386 kernel?
[01:08] <Flannel> yoyoyo: nope, but you might want to add it again if you upgrade to dapper.
[01:08] <bimberi> theCore: wireless-tools
[01:08] <yoyoyo> flannel: ok thanks
[01:09] <Larsson-Sweden> When trying to play a video in fbxine, all i get is "video port failed" , any ideas?
[01:09] <Flannel> twb: why not use the AMD specific kernels?
[01:09] <twb> Flannel: because I forgot to download one.
[01:09] <twb> Flannel: also lots of minority programming languages I use (e.g. scheme) have much better support for IA32 than AMD64,
[01:09] <ltibor65> Hi! How can I see that any firewall runs?
[01:09] <Flannel> twb: well, you could use k7 instead of k8.
[01:10] <twb> Flannel: and that will work?
[01:10] <bosco> how do i figure out what my mac address is in ubuntu
[01:10] <Arrick> whaddup nuts?
[01:10] <theCore> bimberi: thanks
[01:10] <Arrick> what happened to _jason, he go on an extended vacation?
[01:10] <bimberi> theCore: np :)
[01:10] <Arrick> bimberi, how goeth it hter
[01:10] <Arrick> hey theCore which core?
[01:11] <Flannel> twb: yeah.  k7 is AMDs stuff, AMDs 686 kernel, if you will.
[01:11] <bimberi> Arrick: not too bad, yourself?
[01:11] <hollywoodb> will running a k7 kernel over 686 actually make any difference when packages aren't compiled for k7 ?
[01:11] <Flannel> hollywoodb: erm, you have an intel processor?
[01:11] <Arrick> bimberi, I finally got my network printer installed tonight
[01:11] <bimberi> bosco: ifconfig    look for HWaddr
[01:11] <theCore> Arrick: :)
[01:11] <hollywoodb> Flannel: I'm on AMD, I'm just curious
[01:11] <twb> Flannel: good-o.
[01:12] <bimberi> Arrick: nice work, is it connected to a PC or have its own network card?
[01:12] <Drake_> if you use recursive with wget it gets everything above the directory how do you use wget to get everything that is at a certain directory and below?
[01:12] <Flannel> hollywoodb: ah.  The kernel changes are mostly for the kernel, so the kernel will use optomizations for that particular processor.  Programs are usually compiled for 386, and then kernel things.
[01:13] <linchris> My NTFS partition is mounted in /tmp/disks-conf-sda1 but I can only browse it as root, how do I change that?
[01:13] <theCore> Arrick: fyi, my nick come from a game, which got me into programming and art.
[01:13] <hollywoodb> Flannel: right, but if a package is compiled for 386, it isn't going to call on those extensions/optimizations anyways, correct?
[01:13] <linchris> its mounted using disks-admin
[01:14] <Flannel> hollywoodb: no no.  Kernels all provide the same interface, but internally thigns go different, and thats where you get the optomizations.
[01:15] <theCore> Arrick: not from those guys who think that it's normal that a cpu generate more heat per square inches than a stove :)
[01:15] <hollywoodb> Flannel: ah, perhaps I'll switch from 686 to k7 then one of these days... I'm still dealing with running 686 on a x86_64 processor ;)
[01:15] <|neo> im having problems with my rt2500 the Raconfig2500 tells that cant find the driver but the pcmcia card is working....
[01:15] <Larsson-Sweden> Anyone here using fglrx and TV-OUT? Try using the XV driver in your media player. Is there a blank screen where the video should be on your TV?
[01:16] <bosco> bosco bosco allright i have spoofed my mac adress now how do i bring my wireless back up from being down
[01:16] <bosco> bosco bosco sudo iwconfig up
[01:16] <dust> hi. my computer seems to shut of after a while when i not using does anyone know how to check/toggle my power-save options?
[01:16] <bosco> bosco bosco that doesnt wor\
[01:16] <bosco> work
[01:17] <linchris> it works now never mind..
[01:17] <dust> the only other thing i have thought of would be overheating-- so i could check the fan options but i don't know where to do that either.
[01:17] <linchris> I just forgot a letter in fstab :P
[01:17] <soop> anyone here familiar with networking/routing?
[01:18] <goudkov> hi guys, where can i find the package gqview? i have main restricted universe multiverse in my apt, but i still don't have that package
[01:18] <bosco> I JUST CHANGED  my mac adress and now my wireless is down how do i bring it  back up (sudo iwconfig wlan0 up)
[01:18] <crimsun> goudkov: breezy or dapper?
[01:18] <bosco> doesnt work
[01:18] <dust> and it doesn't seem to shut off when i'm using it, which makes it seem unlikely it is the fan
[01:18] <hollywoodb> dust: check power management options under screensaver preferences, advanced tab
[01:18] <soop> I dropped a second nic in my box, connected directly to the wan, and now I can't connect to my lan ip via vpn ....I can connect to the wan ip though
[01:18] <dust> yeah i have the power safe options there turned off
[01:18] <soop> any ideas?
[01:19] <goudkov> crimsun: breezy
[01:19] <crimsun> !info gqview

[01:19] <crimsun> goudkov: did you update/refresh first?
[01:19] <goudkov> i got universe in the list, but i can't find it
[01:19] <goudkov> updating now
[01:19] <goudkov> btw, what's the difference between universe and multiverse?
[01:19] <dust> hollywoodb: yeah i just double checked; they are off.
[01:20] <crimsun> goudkov: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components
[01:20] <goudkov> thanks
[01:20] <dust> any other places where they can be altered?
[01:20] <Drake_> shouldn't you be able to use the rm -d dirname in ubuntu?
[01:21] <bosco> I JUST CHANGED  my mac adress and now my wireless is down how do i bring it  back up (sudo iwconfig wlan0 up)
[01:21] <hollywoodb> bosco: change your mac address back ?
[01:22] <hollywoodb> bosco: if you have mac filtering set up on the router and you haven't added your new mac address to the list that would stop you from gaining access
[01:22] <bosco> hollywoodb, i did that so i could sed spook my way on to a network you should be able to bring it back up and keep the changing
[01:23] <bosco> i am on a random network i am trying to hack into my parents wireless they wont give me access so i will give my self access
[01:23] <bosco> random newtork bearly gettting signal
[01:24] <Kiry> Hello =)
[01:24] <hollywoodb> bosco: well if your parents know enough about setting up their router they probably have mac filtering set up
[01:25] <hollywoodb> bosco: and if another system is already on, using an allowed mac address like it should be, trying with the same mac address won't work either
[01:25] <Arrick> theCore, I thought maybe it was from the Marine Corp but spelled wrong
[01:26] <bosco> hollywoodb,  they do have mac filtering on and since they do i can change my mac adress to what ever i want to in linux and sinice i can i changed my mac address to her mac address she is not on wireless now and all i need to do is to bring my wireless back up after words
[01:26] <dust> so the only way to adjust power options is in the screensaver section?
[01:27] <Larsson-Sweden> If im playing a video in fb with mplayer. The image is too far to the left. Can this be adjusted?
[01:28] <dust> does anyone know where or how to adjust the fan settings?
[01:28] <hollywoodb> dust: you could look through /var/log/ files, or comment out 'Option "DPMS"' in /etc/X11/xorg.conf in the Monitor section if you want your monitor to stay on
[01:28] <linchris> can I configure apt-get so that it always downloads k7 if availible instead of i386?
[01:29] <Drake_> shouldn't you be able to use rm -d dirname to remove dirname and all of it's contents?
[01:29] <hollywoodb> linchris: once k7 is booted & running properly you can remove i386 if you like, otherwise 'apt-get upgrade' will keep them both up to date
[01:29] <dust> hollywoodb: but the whole computer is shutting down, not just the monitor.
[01:29] <sfdsadfdsf> Bill Gates lives!
[01:29] <hollywoodb> Drake_: no. -d is unlink, -r is recursive
[01:30] <hollywoodb> dust: never seen that happen
[01:30] <dust> hollywoodb: yeah it's driving me crazy
=== carthik is now known as carthik_home
[01:31] <Drake_> hollywoodb: so then rm -dr dirname should remove the directory dirname and all the files and sub directories under it instead of above it?
[01:31] <linchris> how do I remove i386, just delete the kernel in the boot folder+
[01:32] <hollywoodb> Drake_: no. -r will, -rf will force.  don't use -d
[01:32] <hollywoodb> linchris: no, remove it with synaptic or apt-get
[01:32] <hollywoodb> Drake_: unlink is a completely different thing
[01:33] <salah> hi. any idea why my ubuntu server-install don't like outgoing connections? I can use ssh/ftp etc, but not ping, wget or any other outgoing connections..
[01:33] <linchris> ok i try it, thanks :)
[01:33] <Drake_> hollywoodb: ok I thought you had to unlink a dir that files in it to be able to delete it without deleting the files in first

[01:39] <rob_p> jojoman02:  Ultrasonic frequencies?  What are you trying to do?

[01:40] <hollywoodb> Firezip: vmware tools as in you have ubuntu running within vmware?
[01:40] <Firezip> yea
[01:41] <Firezip> I have the ISO right here on my desktop
[01:41] <Firezip> extracted and everything

[02:07] <rick_> aye
[02:07] <Firezip> "GRUB Error 21 and 25" lol
[02:07] <Firezip> so much for dual booting
[02:07] <Hexidigital_> rick_: what GDM?
[02:07] <rick_> wait
[02:07] <rick_> GDM?
[02:08] <Codenut> why does my ubuntu CD disks now only come up to set up in german, all of the sudden?
[02:08] <Hexidigital_> rick_: graphical desktop manager... gnome, kde, flux?
[02:09] <rick_> hexidigital_ err..im sorry i'm not very good at these things, just got ubuntu from a friend..
[02:09] <Firezip> Just wondering if there is a Xfire for linux?
[02:10] <rick_> that was gonna be my second question
[02:10] <Firezip> lol
[02:10] <Hexidigital_> rick_: ok, you most likely have gnome.... hang on
[02:10] <Firezip> I think there is a mod for gaim
[02:10] <rick_> ok
[02:10] <Firezip> but I have no clue as to install it
[02:10] <rick_> lol
[02:10] <Codenut> dos anyone else have the same problem?
[02:10] <rick_> yeah
[02:10] <zelu> good night for all...........i am brazilian......
[02:10] <rick_> but im a linuxnoob
[02:10] <Firezip> My summer goal is to learn the linux terminal
[02:11] <Firezip> Yeah me too, windows has corrupted me
[02:11] <BinaryDigits> Firezip good for you :)
[02:11] <BinaryDigits> Codenut is it the same CD you've used before?
[02:11] <rick_> ive put ubuntu on my computer like an hour ago
[02:11] <Codenut> good goal firezipfire
[02:11] <Codenut> yes, it is very wierd.
[02:12] <LinuxJones> rick_, give yourself some time Linux is great
[02:12] <Firezip> I picked up the "linux bible 2006", you think this is a good book?
[02:12] <Codenut> I also get a DOS 7 prompt when installing breezy.
[02:12] <rick_> i hope so, till now im being amazed by how simple it is
[02:12] <Hexidigital_> rick_: i cannot find anything... perhaps one of our more experienced users can help
[02:12] <BinaryDigits> Firezip, i'm sure it is, just go little by little, or you'll get overwhelmed (like I get) hehh
[02:12] <Firezip> ok
[02:13] <Hexidigital_> rick_: it can get complex... but it's more fun that way :)
[02:13] <LinuxJones> Firezip, that book is  based on Debian ?
[02:13] <wims> !restrictedformats
[02:13] <ubotu> somebody said restrictedformats was https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats Most of the formats listed here can be replaced by !FreeFormats
[02:13] <BinaryDigits> i agree with Hexidigital
[02:13] <rick_> i know a clanmember that uses linux but hes not online now
[02:13] <rick_> so ill PM him
[02:13] <rick_> i huess
[02:13] <rick_> guess* he knows
[02:13] <rick_> but thank anyway :)
[02:13] <Firezip> No, I believe it goes over everything, including Ubuntu
[02:14] <Hexidigital_> BinaryDigits: i have a problem with my Broadcom card... i have to log into the network manager, then click prefs for my wlan0 before it starts... ive been working on this since 5:00 am and it's now 8:14 pm
[02:14] <rick_> ill leanr more when things are a challenge
[02:14] <rick_> learn*
[02:14] <rick_> dammit
[02:14] <BinaryDigits> oh yikes =\
[02:14] <Hexidigital_> BinaryDigits: talk about fun :)
[02:14] <rick_> darn?
=== funkyHat_ is now known as funkyHat
[02:14] <Hexidigital_> rick_: aptitude is your friend :)
[02:14] <BinaryDigits> Hexidigital I've heard theres an issue with ubuntu and the broadcom chipsets, have you searched the forums? (probably a silly question) hhehe
[02:15] <rick_> for commands i forward slash?
[02:15] <rick_> a nm
[02:15] <Firezip> ok to dual boot Ubuntu I first need to install windows(done), then install Ubuntu onto my Slave drive(hdb), and then install GRUB onto hda?
[02:15] <Hexidigital_> BinaryDigits: yes, for several weeks, before i could get the light to turn on....
[02:15] <gnomefreak> Firezip: thats one way yep
[02:15] <Hexidigital_> Firezip: yes
[02:15] <gnomefreak> Firezip: install grub to MBR
[02:15] <Hexidigital_> Firezip: that may be the easiest way
[02:15] <Firezip> ok
[02:16] <BinaryDigits> are you on a laptop Hexidigital?
[02:16] <rick_> whats the rename command?
[02:16] <Unity> rick_: mv
[02:16] <Codenut> any thought on why I am getting german?
[02:16] <Firezip> Wow linux support is so much more helpful than windows support
[02:16] <Codenut> on boot
[02:17] <rick_> mv
[02:17] <Firezip> Codenut do you think your BIOS language changed to german?
[02:17] <Hexidigital_> brb.. .need to install some packages on my newly installed laptop (that probably shouldn't have wireless  :)  )
[02:17] <rick_> .
[02:17] <BinaryDigits> hehe
[02:17] <Hexidigital_> Firezip: that's because people actually use linux :)
[02:17] <Hexidigital_> not just check email and surf the web
[02:17] <Codenut> hey, now that is a bright idea
[02:18] <Firezip> lol true
[02:18] <Firezip> Now for linux do I need a firewall and Anti-virus?
[02:18] <eggzeck> no
[02:18] <BinaryDigits> Firezip no :)
[02:18] <salah> is there any resipotories where I can update to the newest version of my applications?
[02:18] <Firezip> :D
[02:18] <Codenut> I am going to try the bios thing tommorow.
[02:18] <BinaryDigits> It's a beautius thing
[02:19] <eggzeck> salah, all you have to do is this: sudo apt-get upgrade
[02:19] <Codenut> cheers,
[02:19] <Unity>  hello, i was wondering, what IS alsa? i know it's like a sound server but then why don't i see alsad in my "ps -A" ? and, Xserver doesn't do anything about sound, so i can listen to mp3's without X running, right?
[02:19] <salah> eggzeck, thanks, is this stable to do?
[02:19] <Firezip> So if I go to a *bad* website, linux won't get infected with nasty spyware and virus's?
[02:19] <eggzeck> salah, sure is, it does the same thing synaptic does :)
[02:19] <linuxpoet> anyone know the status of postgresql 8.1.4 for Ubuntu?
[02:19] <linuxpoet> breezy
[02:19] <linuxpoet> That is correct Firezip
[02:20] <BinaryDigits> lol Firezip
[02:20] <rick_> heh
[02:20] <Firezip> hey how do you type in red?
[02:20] <BinaryDigits> it's when someone mentiones your name
[02:20] <gnomefreak> Firezip: xchat i think allows you to do that
[02:20] <Firezip> oh nice
[02:21] <gnomefreak> or that
[02:21] <gnomefreak> mines yellow ;)
[02:21] <salah> eggzeck, I was thinking of installing the new version of xchat, but there is no ubuntu package there :)
[02:21] <rick_> Firezip is it red?
[02:21] <gnomefreak> salah: what version do you have?
[02:21] <Firezip> yes rick
[02:21] <shedi> salah,  xchat2 ?
[02:21] <rick_> lol
[02:21] <rick_> dont mind me
[02:21] <Firezip> Rick: is it bloog red?

[02:22] <rick_> lol
[02:22] <salah> gnomefreak, shedi, I have version 2.4.4
[02:22] <Firezip> rick_ is it rouge?
[02:22] <BinaryDigits> that is my mini contribution to helping people out lol
[02:22] <salah> I want version 2.6.2 :)
[02:22] <gnomefreak> salah: add the backports for breezy xchat 2.6 is there
[02:22] <rick_> firezip yeah
[02:22] <rick_> lol
[02:22] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell salah -about backports
[02:22] <Firezip> rick_ woot lol
[02:23] <Firezip> Hey does anybody know when DrapperDrake is coming out? I think I herd sometime in June.
[02:23] <Pyru> anyone know how to work k3b to burn regular audio cd's (not mp3 disks)
[02:23] <rick_> what am i explring exavtly
[02:23] <rick_> omg
[02:23] <rick_> exploring*
[02:23] <gnomefreak> rick_:  Firezip you guys are getting a bit too far offtopic now please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:23] <AngryElf> ok......when i first boot up my only resolution available is 800x600......but if i kill gdm then start it back up....i have my normal range of resolutions...any ideas?
[02:23] <rick_> exactly*
[02:24] <rick_> allright gnomefreak
[02:24] <BinaryDigits> oo i didn't know there was an ubuntu-offtopic!
[02:24] <Firezip> Ya same here, see why being a newb is bad...
[02:24] <Pyru> anyone know how to work k3b to burn regular audio cd's (not mp3 disks) please and thank you
[02:24] <BinaryDigits> <--major n00b
[02:24] <Firezip> Ok back on topic, Now if I get a GRUB error(such as 21 or 25) how can I fix it?
[02:25] <Firezip> "linux rescue"?
[02:25] <salah> gnomefreak, I get a error about that backport, the url don't work
[02:26] <wims> hmmm, when i try to start totem i get this message: "The video output is in use by another application. Please close other video applications, or select another video output in the Multimedia Systems Selector." , even though i just rebooted. How do i fix this ?
[02:26] <salah> wims, do this: sudo /etc/init.d/alsa force-reload ... and it should work
[02:26] <gnomefreak> salah: you should have the backports already in your /etc/apt/sources.list file you just need to take the # away from them and save close than apt-get update
[02:27] <blackocellaris> I'm kinda confused.  I have to be logged in as Super-User to install my ATI drivers...but yet I cant login as root...
[02:27] <stalefries> !sudo
[02:27] <ubotu> rumour has it, sudo is a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[02:27] <blackocellaris> sexy
[02:27] <salah> blackocellaris, ubuntu uses sudo instead of su
[02:28] <blackocellaris> beautiful thanks.  I'm still learing ;] 
[02:28] <salah> to log in as super-user you have to make a password for root. do this in console: sudo passwd root
[02:29] <gnomefreak> salah: please dont advise that
[02:29] <salah> gnomefreak, why not?
[02:29] <gnomefreak> ubuntu uses sudo for a reason
[02:29] <wims> salah,  after doing that i get this error message when i start totem from my console : (totem:12724): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_accel_label_set_accel_closure: assertion `gtk_accel_group_from_accel_closure (accel_closure) != NULL' failed
[02:29] <wims>  , it still wont start
[02:29] <rick_> ok what do i do whit a bzip?
[02:29] <salah> gnomefreak, anyways, the url still don't work
[02:29] <rick_> bzip archive
[02:29] <Drake_> how do you reverse the effect of sudo passwd root?
[02:30] <gnomefreak> salah: are you adding them to your sources.list file?
[02:30] <rick_> it says ok and than does nothing
[02:30] <gnomefreak> Drake_: not fun
[02:30] <Pyru> anyone know how i can add support for mp3 files to ubuntu, i cant seem to add files to be burned cuz there showing up as unsupported file types
[02:30] <gnomefreak> Pyru: #ubuntu+1
[02:30] <salah> gnomefreak, no, I already had in on my sources.list, I just removed the # just as you said
[02:30] <stalefries> salah, sudo apt-get update
[02:30] <Drake_> gnomefreak: so it is near impossible?
[02:30] <gnomefreak> salah: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:30] <Sub> Pyru , you need to download mp3 codecs, easiest way is "easy ubuntu"
[02:31] <gnomefreak> Drake_: nop its just not fun
[02:31] <Sub> !tell Pyru about easyubuntu
[02:31] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell Drake_ -about root
[02:31] <salah> gnomefreak, :
[02:31] <salah> root@nx6110:/etc/apt# apt-get update
[02:31] <salah> E: Type 'http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu' is not known on line 36 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:31] <gnomefreak> Drake_: your pm will have the link with the instructions
[02:31] <gnomefreak> salah: please paste your sources.list file to pastebin
[02:31] <Drake_> gnomefreak: thanks
[02:32] <gnomefreak> Drake_: yw
[02:32] <salah> gnomefreak, http://pastebin.com/736218
[02:33] <gnomefreak> salah: the last line the one that is http:// put the word deb in front of it just like the rest of the list
[02:33] <Drake_> I am thinking that there is a simple or at least a more simple way to take directory of several gunzipped files and uncompress them and then to combine them appended to one another
[02:34] <Heath> How do I open up a port on my computer?  I need one open so my webmaster has access to it through ssh
[02:34] <funkja> I just installed bind and I can't seem to figure out how to restart it. Neither named does not apear in my /etc/init.d
[02:34] <JohnCro13> hello, room.
[02:34] <torpedo|dog> Are the US repos still down?
[02:34] <gnomefreak> torpedo|dog: not sure but im thinking yes
[02:34] <gnomefreak> torpedo|dog: does yours work?
[02:34] <Heath> How do I open up a port on my computer?  I need one open so my webmaster has access to it through ssh
[02:34] <salah> gnomefreak, there we go, thanks
[02:34] <linuxcrazy> www.kororaa.org
[02:34] <Drake_> Heath: do you have a router/switch between your computer and your internet connection?
[02:34] <torpedo|dog> gnomefreak, yep. Hence my asking.
[02:35] <gnomefreak> !us
[02:35] <ubotu> **NB** The US Archives are having frequent issues, remove the "us" out of your  sources.list by typing >> sudo sed -i 's/us\.//g' /etc/apt/sources.list <<in a terminal (Menu applications accessories terminal)
[02:35] <gnomefreak> torpedo|dog: run that command than update
[02:35] <Heath> Drake_: yes I have a cable router if thats what you mean O.o It goes to two computers
[02:35] <gnomefreak> brb smoke
[02:36] <JohnCro13> BTTV assistance needed!
[02:36] <funkja> I just installed bind and I can't seem to figure out how to restart it. Named does not apear in my /etc/init.d. How do I add it?
[02:36] <JohnCro13> Mayday!
[02:36] <Drake_> Heath: you are going to have to first forward the port that is going to be used to connect to your ssh server on your router to the ip address of the computer you want to connect
[02:36] <Heath> Drake_: Step by step?
[02:37] <Hexidigital_> !portforward
[02:37] <ubotu> methinks portforward is visit portforward.com for a comprehensive site on how to forward your ports for games, torrents, webservers, etc
[02:38] <jmk> !portforward
[02:38] <ubotu> I heard portforward is visit portforward.com for a comprehensive site on how to forward your ports for games, torrents, webservers, etc
[02:38] <jmk> !help
[02:38] <stalefries> jmk, what?
[02:40] <yaaar> word
[02:40] <Drake_> any suggestion on the fastest way to uncompress gunzipped files in multiple directories and append all of the files into one?
[02:41] <funkja> I just installed bind and I can't seem to figure out how to restart it. Named does not apear in my /etc/init.d. Bind is in there, but commands like start stop restart don't actually do anything on it. Any ideas?
[02:41] <yaaar> anybody know why my serial ports wouldn't come up? i appear to have appropriate kernel support but 'dmesg | grep tty' doesn't give any output
=== JohnCro13 is now known as joel_
[02:42] <Hexidigital_> anyone know what commands are executed  by opening network manager, than clicking preferences for a specific connection? i need to write a script for my wlan0
[02:43] <eCokeNCod> apt-get not working ppl ... can anyone help ... my sources seem to be screwed
[02:43] <rob138> how do i remove the azureus popup? i can't click the hide buttons?
[02:43] <Hexidigital_> ubotu: tell eCokeNCod about easysource
[02:43] <Hexidigital_> did you try that eCokeNCod
[02:43] <gnomefreak> eCokeNCod: can you paste them to pastebin please
[02:43] <Heath> eCokeNCod: Did you recently try to change your computers name?
[02:44] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: only issue with that is us repos are down
[02:44] <Hexidigital_> gnomefreak: ah.. wasn't aware of that :) ty
[02:44] <Max-O-Matic> sudo apt-get maybe
[02:45] <Hexidigital_> gnomefreak: do you know for how long?
[02:45] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: not off hand but according to the uproar from that news site they are moving
[02:45] <gnomefreak> slashdot or whatever its called
[02:45] <torpedo|dog> I've got a sound problem that I tried solving last night.
=== joel_ is now known as JohnCro13
[02:46] <JohnCro13> Argh!
[02:46] <JohnCro13> I have to go.
[02:46] <JohnCro13> bye all.
[02:47] <Hexidigital_> brb
[02:47] <torpedo|dog> Would anybody help me with such?
[02:47] <hollywoodb> torpedo|dog: just state the problem
[02:48] <Drake_> any suggestion on the fastest way to uncompress gunzipped files in multiple directories and append all of the files into one?
[02:48] <torpedo|dog> Alright. So whenever I try recording, I get this: http://thetorpedodog.ath.cx:3242/~thetorpedodog/xkxxkxkxkxkx.ogg (60 kB, TURN DOWN YOUR VOLUME)
[02:49] <stalefries> Drake_: manually. Or a script
[02:49] <Managu_away> Drake_: not sure what you mean.  "gunzipped" files?  Gunzip never spits out more than 1 file -- and it's by definition uncompressed
[02:50] <Drake_> stalefries: wasn't sure what would be the best approach to do so
=== Managu_away is now known as Managu
[02:50] <lwizardl> anyone here use mythtv in ubuntu?
[02:50] <Managu> lwizardl: I have a myth/ubuntu box
[02:50] <stalefries> Drake: stick all the .gz's in one folder, move to the folder you want the contents dumped into.
[02:50] <Heath> How do I find my routers IP?
[02:51] <lwizardl> Managu, wanna help me with an issue
[02:51] <stalefries> Heath: try 192.168.0.1
[02:51] <blackocellaris> Heath, have you tried 192.168.1.1 also?
[02:51] <Managu> lwizardl: I can try, I suppose.  What's your issue?
[02:51] <stalefries> Heath: or .2.1
[02:52] <Arrick> Heath, how about ifconfig
[02:52] <Arrick> or iwconfig
[02:52] <lwizardl> Managu, I followed this http://www.abarbaccia.com/content/view/15/29/ other than the passwords he uses
[02:52] <Xenguy> Drake_: gunzip the files; then do a find files + xargs cat to a file (if that makes *any* sense at all :-)
[02:52] <Heath> Thank you got it you all
[02:52] <Heath> stalefries is the winner
[02:52] <blackocellaris> :'(
[02:52] <Drake_> Managu_away: what I have is that I have 13 directories and each of those have 1 to 20 gz files in them that I am wanting to uncompress and combine all of the files in all of the directories into one long file
[02:52] <Arrick> Heath, you would hav got it my way too
[02:52] <wims> I now got a 64 bit OSm is it possible to do a dist-upgrade to get a 32 bit os ?
[02:52] <Arrick> it show your connections
[02:52] <stalefries> Drake: then do "tar -zxvf /path/to/gzips/*.gz".
[02:52] <lwizardl> Managu, and when i restart and log into the mythtv user from gnome i just get put into the setup app and then it resets to login screen
[02:52] <stalefries> Drake: then pack em all again at your will
[02:52] <Heath> Well I tried that already Arrick it only showed my computers IP
[02:53] <Managu> Drake_: "gzcat */*.gz" ?
[02:53] <Managu> lwizardl: lemme browse that web page
[02:53] <lwizardl> ok
[02:53] <sander_> The synce-kde package should be upgraded before the release of Dapper. Is there a chance of this happening/who can I notify/what can I do to make this happen?
[02:53] <stalefries> blackocellaris: I win!
[02:53] <Arrick> should have shown the dhcp as well
[02:54] <Arrick> gateway actually would be your router
[02:54] <abarbaccia> lwizardl: if you need some mythtv help you should joing #mythtv-users
[02:54] <quinn> hey how do i upgrade firefox to the current version?
[02:54] <Managu> lwizardl: That howto looks like a big headache, and mostly not necessary on Ubuntu.
[02:55] <lwizardl> abarbaccia, is that your site?
[02:55] <stalefries> !firefox1.5
[02:55] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[02:55] <ficusplanet> Hey everyone.  I'm getting an error from sudo: "timestamp too far in the future."  How do I fix this?
[02:55] <abarbaccia> lwizardl: yep
[02:55] <quinn> ty
[02:55] <Hexidigital_> is the release date for Edgy still June 1?
[02:55] <Arrick> reset the time to the actual time
[02:55] <Drake_> Managu: never used gzcat it is possible to unzip multiple files in multiple directories and combine them in one file in one command?
[02:56] <Arrick> yes
[02:56] <Arrick> Drake_, ^^
[02:56] <ficusplanet> Arrick: I am on the actual time now.  I just set up this computer and the clock was a day behind, so I fixed it.  Now sudo won't work.
[02:56] <Arrick> put it back its wanting the ubuntu server
[02:56] <lwizardl> whats i'm trying to do is setup a mythtv box for recording just from VHS and just playing videos back
[02:57] <Arrick> you gotta set the correct timezone in order to switch the time
[02:57] <ficusplanet> Arrick: So you're saying that in order to use sudo I have to have the wrong time on my computer?  That's insane.
[02:57] <Arrick> no
[02:57] <bryan> patch??
[02:57] <bryan> are you here??
[02:57] <Managu> lwizardl: have a IVTV-based capture card?
[02:57] <mfuentes> HI, any know how activate the PHP logs? I have apache2+php5 but I don't found the error logs
[02:58] <Arrick> ficusplanet, you need to put the time back, then set the correct timezone for the system, and it will correct the time for you
[02:58] <ficusplanet> Arrick: The timezone is already correct.
[02:58] <Arrick> then how was the thing a day behind?
[02:58] <quinn> how do i get r/w access to the /opt/ folder and any other folders
[02:58] <lwizardl> Managu, PVR-150 i think that is compatible
[02:58] <Managu> lwizardl: yup.  Have you got the IVTV drivers all set up and working?
[02:58] <ficusplanet> Arrick: I have no idea.  That was just the time that was there after setup.
[02:58] <Arrick> ok, did it ask you for your timezone when you installed?
[02:59] <lwizardl> don't know I just followed that site
[02:59] <nayif> what a magic on ubuntu can now other OS and then add it to the boot list on grub , and is there an easy why to use this magic wiht out reinstall ubuntu?
[02:59] <Managu> lwizardl: ahh, I see
[02:59] <lwizardl> i think they are correctly working
[02:59] <ficusplanet> Arrick: Yes, and it is set correctly: America/Chicago.
[02:59] <Arrick> ew
[02:59] <Arrick> ok
[02:59] <Arrick> help on this one guys
[02:59] <Samuli^> nayif, the magic is called grub and you just need to re-install it.
[02:59] <Hexidigital_> lol
[03:00] <ficusplanet> Arrick: If I wait until tomorrow, will it stop complaining about the time difference maybe?
[03:00] <Hexidigital_> Samuli^, you understood that?
[03:00] <Arrick> the timezone should have put it in correctly for you, Im in michigan and my 2 installs today worked fine, something must have been up with the server
[03:00] <Samuli^> Hexidigital, I think.. :)
[03:00] <Managu> ficusplanet: sudo's not working?  And complaining about a time error?
[03:00] <Arrick> I doubt it ficusplanet
[03:01] <l1lk1ll> I'm having a lot of problems with compiz
[03:01] <ficusplanet> Managu: Yes.
[03:01] <Managu> ficusplanet: have a pastebin of the exact error text?
[03:01] <nayif> Hexidigital i mean the magic not the tool :)
[03:01] <nayif> Hexidigital he think i do not know about reinstall grub with live-cd
[03:02] <Samuli^> nayif, what do you mean by magic?
[03:02] <mkoby> Hi all, I'm SSH'd into one of my computers that always sets too high a refresh rate, how can I force it to not allow any refresh rates above 80hz using 1024x768, entirely from the console?
[03:02] <ficusplanet> Managu: No, I'm on a different PC right now, but the error is: "timestamp too far in the future" and then the date and time.
[03:03] <nayif> Samuli^: after you install fedora on your pc wich has windows and ubuntu you will notce this :magic:
[03:03] <mkoby> nayif: magic?
[03:03] <Managu> ficusplanet: the way stuff works in here is usually give and take.  If you don't have access to the computer/os/etc that's causing trouble, there's not a while bunch that can be done
[03:03] <bsdfox> ok this dual monitor thing is bugging me now and I need help. http://pastebin.com/736203 is my xorg.conf. I can't get my lcd monitor working unless twinview is on wtf am I doing wrong? this works: http://www.pastebin.com/736221, this doesn't http://www.pastebin.com/736203. please help!
[03:03] <Hexidigital_> what are you installing fedora for?
[03:03] <nayif> Samuli^: ubuntu :install: can know about other OS not like other
[03:03] <Drake_> Arrick: yes? any direction of where to look about doing that or you were saying what Managu was saying about gzcat */*.gz should uncompress and cat everything into one long file?
[03:03] <Samuli^> nayif, I see.
=== mkoby is now known as theblue
[03:04] <Hexidigital_> can we say LSD?
[03:04] <Managu> Drake_: why don't you try it and see?
[03:04] <Hexidigital_> :)
[03:04] <ficusplanet> Managu: Wait a second.  If I pasted the message I just typed manually for you that would somehow be of more help?  Do pastebins have some form of magical power I'm not aware of?
[03:04] <Samuli^> nayif, so you just want to know how they ubuntu does that?
[03:04] <Samuli^> -they
[03:04] <Managu> ficusplanet: happen to have the last few lines of /var/log/auth.log?
[03:04] <Drake_> Managu: lol well I was making sure I didn't want it to be like a nasty rm -r \ lol
[03:05] <nayif> Samuli^: yes thet what i am ,looking for
[03:05] <nayif> -that
[03:05] <Hexidigital_> lol
[03:05] <theblue> Hi all, I'm SSH'd into one of my computers that always sets too high a refresh rate, how can I force it to not allow any refresh rates above 80hz using 1024x768, entirely from the console?
[03:06] <Managu> theblue: "sudo nano /etc/X11/Xorg.conf" might be a good place to start ;-)
[03:06] <theblue> Managu: I tried that, but I don't know what to change.
[03:06] <Hexidigital_> be back later... see you guys
[03:06] <Samuli^> nayif, I think it's just the grub. Maybe other distros like Fedora just run the grub-install with options so that it only looks for windows.
[03:06] <Managu> theblue: oh, ok, lemme check...
[03:07] <bioeng> How do I dual boot Ubuntu and Windows XP?
[03:07] <bimberi> !dualboot
[03:07] <ubotu> for wintel https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo :for the Mac https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot
[03:07] <Managu> theblue: I presume your problem is that the refresh rate is too high for the monitor you have connected?
[03:07] <ficusplanet> Managu: I don't see anything about the error in there.
[03:07] <theblue> Managu: Correct.
[03:07] <rob_p> ficusplanet:  Try, "sudo -K" at the command prompt to remove your bogus sudo timestamp.  Hopefully that'll get things straightened out for you.
[03:08] <bioeng> So you type !dualboot where at?  Does this bring up a screen where you can select an operating system?
[03:08] <reconcilliation> Bio - an ubuntu installation will install a bootloader called GRUB
[03:08] <theblue> bioeng: Do you already have XP installed?
[03:08] <ficusplanet> rob_p: Awesome.  That worked.  Thank you very much.
[03:08] <Managu> theblue: happen to have the specs on your monitor?  If you lower the HorizSync and VertRefresh in section "Monitor" to jive with your monitor, the refresh rates should get themselves better in line
[03:08] <rob_p> ficusplanet:  welcome
[03:09] <nayif> Samuli^: aha , i see then , then if i need this what i could it :magic: must i use ubuntu live cd , i hope ubuntu will make the use of fix the boot more easier on next rlease
[03:09] <bioeng> So Grub will allow you to boot up Windows XP?
[03:09] <theblue> Managu: So I should just copy the stats on the back of the monitor to the Xorg.conf file?
[03:09] <duneatreides> hello everybody
[03:10] <reconcilliation> bio: assuming that XP is already installed and there is enough free disk space - YES!
[03:10] <Managu> theblue: if your monitor has those numbers printed on it, aye.  Usually you need a manual or such to find the supported Horizontal Sync and Vertical Refresh rates
[03:10] <theblue> Managu: Ok, thanks.
[03:10] <bioeng> Where in Ubuntu would you go to load Windows XP?
[03:11] <theblue> bioeng: In my experience, it all works much better if you load Windows first, and then Linux.
[03:11] <duneatreides> I am new to linux and I have a problem with Rhythm Box player
[03:11] <theblue> bioeng: Since Windows, by default, will wipe out anything else on the drive.
[03:11] <KanRiNiN> Can I install from the live cd?
[03:11] <theblue> bioeng: And Ubuntu usually doesn't.
[03:11] <duneatreides> KanRiNiN
[03:11] <bioeng> Windows was installed first
[03:12] <duneatreides> I believe that you can
[03:12] <bioeng> Now I am installing Linux
[03:12] <theblue> KanRiNiN: Not yet, but in the next version, you'll be able to.
[03:12] <bioeng> So is there a menu item to load Windows XP?
[03:12] <gnomefreak> bioeng: reboot and grub should load and give you a chice use the arrow til you get to windows and hit enter
[03:12] <gnomefreak> bioeng: yes
[03:12] <duneatreides> Can anyone help me with Rhythm Box music player?
[03:13] <reconcilliation> dune: Ask your question :)
[03:13] <duneatreides> I created a partition for my mp3 files, and when I try to import them, Rhythm box just quits
[03:13] <duneatreides> import the folder
[03:13] <duneatreides> I can import individual files with out a problem
[03:13] <bioeng> OK, so when I boot up, I'll get a menu choice
[03:14] <bioeng> I just wanted to make sure
[03:14] <bioeng> Thanks
[03:14] <theblue> bioeng: Right.
[03:14] <theblue> bioeng: No problem.
[03:14] <gnomefreak> bioeng: yep should
[03:14] <reconcilliation> dune: I'm gonna try that out
[03:14] <lwizardl> Managu, you mind telling me what you did to get mythtv working on ubuntu
[03:15] <duneatreides> Reconcilliation, (thanks for helping), I can't import my /music partition, but I can import individual files
[03:15] <duneatreides> I wasn't to clear the first time around
[03:15] <Managu> lwizardl: without messing my system up any (i.e. by changing kernels, compiliing odd modules, etc), I ran "apt-get install mythtv", and followed the on-screen directions from there
[03:17] <mzuverink> I was running dapper and all was fine until a kernel update that rendered my shiny new ipod a 60gig paperwieght.  I am going to reinstall and am wondering if I should reinstall dapper or go with breezy.  Dapper will be released in a week.  I know in some distros waiting a while after the new release is advisable, but what about Ubuntu?
[03:17] <Managu> lwizardl: have you tried fishing your circumstances around in #mythtv-user(s?) as abarbaccia suggested?
[03:17] <theblue> mzuverink: I usually wait 2 or 3 weeks after the formal release, but anything after the release date should be safe.
[03:17] <lastnode> mzuverink: er, what were you using to interface with teh ipod?
[03:17] <theblue> mzuverink: I only wait mostly because I'm lazy.
[03:17] <lwizardl> yes no response
[03:17] <mzuverink> lastnode, gtkpod and gtpixpod
[03:18] <lastnode> mzuverink: so what's the error? ubuntu doesnt automount?
[03:18] <lastnode> mzuverink: in any case, that's a question for #ubuntu+1
[03:19] <funkja> what does this error mean when I try to start my apache2?  [Wed May 24 20:18:31 2006]  [error]  (EAI 2)Name or service not known: Cannot resolve host name jasonleefunk.com --- ignoring!
[03:19] <Managu> abarbaccia: still here?
[03:19] <abarbaccia> Managu: yeah, whats up
[03:19] <funkja> is it a problem with my apache config or my dns config?
[03:19] <mzuverink> lastnode, it would automount until I reinstalled hal and dbus, and it would not unmount at all
[03:20] <mzuverink> lastnode, I asked here because of the breezy aspect of the question.  I ask there and I will get a ton of "it works fine here..."
[03:20] <Managu> Just figure I'd pass the buck on to you.  lwizardl's got questions about your (?) walkthrough of installing MythTV
[03:20] <abarbaccia> Managu: thanks - i'll attend ot him in Mythtv-users if he's there
[03:21] <l1lk1ll> Can someone quickly remind me the command to edit my xorg.conf?
[03:21] <mzuverink> lastnode, And you will note I did not ask a dapper related question specifically, I asked about the release schedule and the advisability of waiting
[03:21] <lastnode> mzuverink: nobody in #ubuntu+1 had the same problem? that's wierd.
[03:21] <mzuverink> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:21] <lastnode> mzuverink: wait a few days, it might get fixed
[03:21] <l1lk1ll> thank you
[03:21] <Managu> l1lk1ll: from within X?  I'd suggest "gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf".
[03:21] <reconcilliation> dune: can you gve me some info about the partition itself - like what is the file system format (e.g. ext2, ext3)
[03:22] <l1lk1ll> thank you managu, I think I messed mine up heh
[03:22] <duneatreides> the file system is ext3
[03:22] <Managu> l1lk1ll: if you messed yours up, mzuverink's command might be a better idea
[03:22] <KarlsBerg`> Hi,
[03:23] <maggot> hi hi hi
[03:23] <l1lk1ll> Well, I just added my own display resolutions, but I forgot to add it to each depth...and I'm a complete noob but
[03:23] <l1lk1ll> I think that might be causing problems with compiz
[03:23] <maggot> does anyone know how to tell if my cpu has hyperthreading?
[03:24] <Managu> maggot: there should be some mention of it being detected during startup; e.g. "dmesg | less"
[03:24] <maggot> :-( i did a dmesg -c
[03:24] <maggot> Managu, so i'm going to have to reboot ?
[03:25] <maggot> Managu, is there any way I can tell from the /proc/cpuinfo thingy ?
[03:25] <duneatreides> Reconcilliation, the file system is ext3, the device location is /dev/hdb5  ( I added a second harddrive 160 Gig ) and the size of the partition is 20.0 GB
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[03:25] <l1lk1ll> Hey Managu, you seem helpful... So another quickie if you don't mind... I'm on a linksys right now, ethernet,  I just bought a Dlink wireless....is that going to be painless?
[03:25] <Managu> maggot: do I want to know why you ran dmesg -c?  Yeah, you should be able to read it off from /proc/cpuinfo -- but it'll involve some googling
[03:25] <l1lk1ll> (im still going to be wired to the hub on this pc)
[03:25] <khaladan> can I make a command act as if it was run w/ nohup AFTER it has started running?
[03:26] <Managu> l1lk1ll: shouldn't be too problematic, so long as you're not doing anything complicated
[03:26] <l1lk1ll> Well I mean, should I just turn the PC off, plug it in, turn it back on and done?
[03:26] <maggot> Managu, Well, I'm trying (futiley) to get my IPod to mount automatically. It doesn't seem to want to mount and the current dmesg information was confusing me, so i cleared it. :-/
[03:26] <l1lk1ll> or is it going to be complex? my normal router didn't require any extra config
[03:26] <Managu> khaladan: you want to detach it from the shell's process group.  I'm not really an expert on that, but you might look over the man pages for "detach"
[03:27] <reconcilliation> dune: is that partition on a seperate drive
[03:27] <l1lk1ll> Wow Managu I feel bad asking you such simple questions when you have so many people spamming you
[03:27] <l1lk1ll> I'm sorry
[03:27] <KarlsBerg`> need help :S, cant remove a package (ati official drivers) wanna remove the drivers for install the opens drivers, but cant remove, cant purge: http://pastebin.com/736271
[03:27] <Managu> l1lk1ll: never used a dLink router.  That said, I suspect that it'll give you a dhcp address just the same as most home routers
[03:27] <azurehuesofblue> hey is there a program like those on windows where you can transform an IP adress to a geographical map maybe even satalite (crosses fingers)?
[03:27] <khaladan> crap, no entry for detach
[03:27] <Managu> l1lk1ll: ehh, no worries
[03:27] <l1lk1ll> ok thank you :D assuming it's like most routers will it  automatically do that or should I turn PC off first?
[03:28] <reconcilliation> dune: nvm missed your last
[03:28] <KarlsBerg`> need help :S, cant remove a package (ati official drivers) wanna remove the drivers for install the opens drivers, but cant remove, cant purge: http://pastebin.com/736271
[03:28] <Managu> l1lk1ll: it won't work automatically (unless you're very, very patient).  Rebooting will work.  Alternately, you could "sudo ifdown eth0" then "sudo ifup eth0"
[03:28] <azurehuesofblue> IP > geo map?
[03:28] <blackocellaris> Tarutaru :X
[03:28] <l1lk1ll> heh I think rebooting is my best bet, thank you so much <3
[03:28] <Managu> l1lk1ll: or use the networking panel under system administration menu to do the same thing
[03:29] <Drake_> azurehuesofblue: cheops ng maybe is something like you are looking for though not sat
[03:29] <Taru> blackocellaris, ^^
[03:29] <azurehuesofblue> hmm ok.
[03:29] <azurehuesofblue> Drake_ I will check that out.

[03:31] <KarlsBerg`> yes im spanish :S
[03:31] <duneatreides> reconcilliation, yes my partition is on a seperate drive
[03:31] <l1lk1ll> goodbye internet world.
[03:31] <Managu> KarlsBerg`: tried fishing your question around #ubuntu-es?
[03:31] <azurehuesofblue> Drake_ swiss army knife... looks cool, thanks.
[03:31] <cocox> hi everybody
[03:32] <KarlsBerg`> dont know the fix
[03:32] <cocox> anyone knows how to ask totem to show us the "find" box ???
[03:32] <KarlsBerg`> Managu,  cant question here ? 
[03:32] <duneatreides> reconcilliation the file system is ext3, the device location is /dev/hdb5  ( I added a second harddrive 160 Gig ) and the size of the partition is 20.0 GB
[03:33] <Managu> KarlsBerg`: I suppose there's nothing stopping you.  But (speaking just for myself) I don't read spanish, which makes diagnosing those error messages a lot harder.  And a lot less interesting.
[03:33] <reconcilliation> The problem must lie in the fact that the partition is on a seperate drive. I cant duplicate the error using just one drive and the pc I'm on doesn't have another. All I can suggest is reporting the bug. I know thats a lame solution but its all I can offer right now.
[03:34] <duneatreides> That is what I figured, thank you any way Reconcilliation
[03:34] <Managu> duneatreides: what seems to be your problem?  Grub?
[03:34] <duneatreides> i am new to Linux, and how do I report the bug?
[03:34] <Healot> launchpad.net
[03:34] <wims> gvim
[03:34] <Drake_> duneatreides: email Linus. Joke
[03:35] <wims> oops wrong widow
[03:35] <duneatreides> well, I just added a second hard drive Seagate Barracude 160 G, and I created a /music partition for my mp3 files
[03:35] <Healot> then you need some registration... select the product, search/look at the bug list first
[03:35] <VitaminG> so whats the bug?
[03:35] <Healot> if there isn't any, then you may file the bug
[03:35] <duneatreides> now when I try to import the /music partition into Rhytmbox, it crashes, but I can import individual files without out a problem
[03:36] <reconcilliation> dune: There are many other good audio players such as Totem and VLC that you can use aswell
[03:36] <VitaminG> or xmms
[03:36] <Managu> duneatreides: is it possible that one of your mp3 files is corrupted?  In just such a way as makes RythmBox hate you?
[03:36] <KarlsBerg`> sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[03:37] <duneatreides> Managu, I'm not sure, they  all work well in Winamp (I'm currently in transition from Windows to LInux)
[03:37] <KarlsBerg`> cant remove the package ! -.-!!
[03:37] <Managu> duneatreides: also, you can import individual files -- from the /music directory?
[03:37] <cocox> anyone knows how to ask totem to show us the "find" box ???
[03:37] <reconcilliation> dune: And no better time transition that with the up and comming dapper drake
[03:37] <duneatreides> Managu, that is correct, I can import individual files, but I can't import my entire /music partition
[03:38] <haasteem> hi, does anyone here use QtiPlot for plotting graphs and such?
[03:38] <Managu> duneatreides: well, it may be tedious, but it seems to me a clear workaround would just to import each of your mp3s, one by one
[03:39] <duneatreides> Managu, tediuous is the word, I have 780 mp3's
[03:39] <duneatreides> Managu, since mp3 is a non-free format, what is a good converter so I can convert all of my mp3's into ogg?
[03:40] <Healot> heh better stick wit mp3
=== kuja is now known as Davey|kuja
[03:40] <KanRiNiN> yuck, never convert from lossy to lossy
[03:40] <Managu> duneatreides:  errm, got me.  I'm one of the few people who doesn't deal with music regularly
[03:40] <Healot> duneatreides: you can use the tools from vorbis.org though
[03:40] <Pyru> hello, i just installed apache / php and mysql how do i get to the mysql folder to set a password for phpmyadmin?
[03:40] <Pyru> i cant seem to get to the mysql directory
[03:40] <duneatreides> KanRiNiN, why shouldn't you convert from lossy to lossy?
[03:42] <Healot> lossy quality already suck, why you need to make it suckier
[03:42] <Managu> duneatreides: Imagine I take a sentence.  One way to "compress" it would be to remove all the vowels.  It's lossy, but people would generally be able to make some sense of the result:  "Th ct in th ht rtrnd"
[03:42] <KanRiNiN> because you degrade the quality so far that your ear can really pick it up.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but converting from say, 192 mp3 to the same lossy ogg quality would yield a quality of less than 128 or even 96
[03:42] <KarlsBerg`> anybpody can helpme to remove a package ? cant remove, return error output 2, and error code (1)
[03:43] <GTroy> anyone know where there's a linux games channel?
[03:43] <duneatreides> Well, I have to run, thank you all for your help
[03:43] <Managu> duneatreides: another way to compress would be to remove the last letter in every word.  Again lossy, but not too bad: "Th ca i th ha returne".  Do both at the same time, though ...

=== Davey|kuja is now known as Davey|THE_Real_D
[03:45] <azurehuesofblue> is is Drake_ still here?
[03:46] <reconcilliation> dune mp32ogg is a cool program that I use to convert my mp3s then with a simple rm /path/to/*.mp3  im good to go
[03:46] <cocox> Managu, yes sometimes when i type with my keyboard a box is showed to me
[03:46] <sybariten> ok, a question about samba
[03:46] <sybariten> i can see some remote files in nautilus
[03:46] <blackocellaris> What do y'all use for mp3 decoders?  I'm having trouble finding something that I can compile
[03:46] <sybariten> but they have a location/path that starts with smb://, according to the properties
[03:46] <Managu> blackocellaris: looked over the wiki?
[03:46] <sybariten> the question is, can i also reach those files from the terminal ?
[03:47] <Healot> blackocellaris: we are LAMErs :)
[03:47] <blackocellaris> Somewhat, I think I might have confused myself a bit with it though.  I'll give it another shot (just got frustrated)
[03:47] <Managu> sybariten: possibly, but not as easily
[03:47] <wims> is it impossible for me to watch wmv videos on my 64 bit breezy ?
[03:47] <sybariten> Managu: ok ... any ideas on how to investigate this ?
[03:47] <azurehuesofblue> hey guys, basically I was here a few minutes ago looking for IP > geo map... Drake_ recomended cheops-ng... it's over my head... good bookmark though.
[03:47] <Commander-Crowe> OK i need help
[03:47] <Managu> sybariten: There's a utility called (?) "smb" for browsing and accessing SMB shares
[03:48] <Healot> wims: it is, try mplayer... but not all MS-MPEG4 media can be played
[03:48] <Commander-Crowe> I'm trying to get ubuntu to boot up on a Mac 6300CD
[03:48] <Managu> sybariten: it's also possible to "smbmount" a remote share, if your kernel supports it
[03:49] <sybariten> Managu: yeah, that i know. I have done that before on other distros ...  i'm just curious if this one isnt already mounted somewhere in the system, since i can definitely reach the files
[03:49] <Healot> Commander-Crowe: what is the Mac's CPU? sorry not familiar with MAcs
[03:49] <wims> Healot, i tried mapley, but the w32 codecs woouldn't work in 64 bit, i only got sound, no video
[03:49] <Commander-Crowe> I press C but that didn't work
[03:49] <Commander-Crowe> I changed the boot device thingy and that didin't work
[03:49] <paradizelost> hey all, i've got a fresh install, and when  doing the updates it hard locks
[03:49] <paradizelost> kernel panic
[03:49] <Commander-Crowe> 603e
[03:49] <Commander-Crowe> is the cpu
[03:49] <paradizelost> i've done memtest and the memory checks out fine
[03:50] <wims> i also tried VLC, same issue there, no video, only sound
[03:50] <azurehuesofblue> is there any software for linux that changes IP address into a map? or lat & long?
[03:50] <biovore> hmmm 603 PPC from freescale or IBM?
[03:50] <Healot> Commander-Crowe: is it a G3/G4/G5 class CPU?
[03:50] <Managu> sybariten: well, you can always run "mount" from the console to check -- but I suspect the answer is no
[03:50] <sybariten> Managu: ah, good idea
[03:50] <biovore> ubuntu needs a 74xx or better I think.
[03:50] <LinuxLover> AHH I NEED HELP... My Linux isnt letting me online anymore at all I tried ethernet and USB ports... I tried opening up a port through portforward and now my net won't connect so I'm on my windows machine now PLEASE HELP!!!
[03:50] <biovore> needs altivec
[03:51] <Healot> wims: as I said, not all MS-MPEG4 media can be played properly
[03:51] <sybariten> Managu: nah, its not really there.
[03:51] <Managu> sybariten: I can't say I'm surprised :-)
[03:52] <Managu> LinuxLover: might I suggest perusing "http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"?
[03:52] <LinuxLover> Managu: Thank you I will look there
[03:53] <Commander-Crowe> Healot: its a step just before G3
=== Davey|THE_Real_D is now known as kuja
[03:54] <Healot> oh... ubuntu need at least a G3 cpu... i think, check ubuntu.com
[03:54] <brandon_> is it possible to use wget to grab all files with a certain extension on a website?
[03:54] <paradizelost> brandon_: man wget
[03:54] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost, do you have any other installs on that drive?
[03:54] <Commander-Crowe> oh
[03:54] <Commander-Crowe> what Distro can use a 6300CD or 603e Proc?
[03:54] <paradizelost> Hexidigital - this isn't even an AMD64, it's an Athlon XP 3000+
[03:54] <Healot> for nearly all linux, a G3...
[03:55] <Hexidigital_> hmmmmm...
[03:55] <paradizelost> but yes, it has a windows install on the first partition
[03:55] <LinuxLover> Here goes.  I tried to open up port 22 with portfoward.com for ssh so my webmaster could help me with some things.  When I restarted my Cable Router it wouldn't let me on my Linux but it still lets me on my Windows computer.  Can anyone help?
[03:55] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[03:55] <Commander-Crowe> I'l stick with MacOS 8.1 then
[03:55] <Mau> hi! does anyone knows how can i accentuate in bitch x?
[03:56] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost, how many install tries... this the first attempt
[03:56] <Hexidigital_> ?
[03:56] <paradizelost> 2nd
[03:56] <Hexidigital_> jeez
[03:56] <paradizelost> same cd though, i did do the cd verification as well
[03:57] <Managu> LinuxLover: much better!  What do you mean when you say "It won't let you on your linux"?  Do you mean that people can't log into your machine remotely?  That you can't log in locally?
[03:57] <Hexidigital_> do you have an old cd? or can you burn a new one?
[03:57] <paradizelost> it's a flight 7 disc
[03:57] <paradizelost> i just burned it yesterday
[03:58] <LinuxLover> Managu: It won't let me get on the internet on my Linux and that is a HUGE problem for me because if I can't get online I can't keep my website going which means I don't make any money
[03:58] <paradizelost> i may just wait for dapper final and use that cd.
[03:58] <paradizelost> i'd hate to load breezy just to have it upgrade in a week
[03:59] <biovore> load dapper now then :-P
[03:59] <Managu> LinuxLover: ok, so you can log on locally, but you don't have internet connectivity (right?).  Did you have functioning internet access at any point in the past, when booted into Ubuntu?
[03:59] <paradizelost> biovore: you haven't been listening to the conversation have you?
[03:59] <Healot> Commander-Crowe: G4 and G5 or later only... linux starts late for Macs :)
[04:00] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost, do you have a flight 6 disc to hold you over til RC1 comes out? perhaps it's a buggy .iso
[04:00] <paradizelost> flight 7 only
[04:00] <Hexidigital_> :(
[04:00] <paradizelost> different burn worked fine in 4 other systems though
[04:00] <Drake_> yellowdog and some support for fedora on older mac hardware
[04:00] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yes, I have been into this chat many times lately as "Heath", It just stoped working when I tried to forward port 22.  I went back and did just a basic setup again and it still is not working (on my router).  And yes I can log in it just won't let me on the internet.
[04:00] <Commander-Crowe> ok
[04:01] <Commander-Crowe> I'll go with DSL then
[04:01] <Managu> LinuxLover: errm, I don't mean to be too rude, but could you rewrite that reply without using "it"?
[04:02] <Hexidigital_> i concur with Managu
[04:02] <azurehuesofblue> Hey Drake_ ... cheops-ng is over my head at the moment, any other ideas for IP > map?
[04:03] <sflash> anyone know how to set up a smb.conf file?
[04:03] <azurehuesofblue> it's a great bookmark tho
[04:03] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yep sorry, My internet just stopped working when I tried to forward port 22 from my router to my IP.  My internet stopped alowing me to connect and I went back and tried to redo a basic setup on the router (to set the settings back to normal) and that didnt work.
[04:03] <paradizelost> sflash: did you get your issue from last night handled?
[04:04] <sflash> haha , no
[04:04] <sflash> i ended up reformatting and installing a server version
[04:04] <sflash> no gui
[04:04] <Managu> LinuxLover: You can connect to the internet through your router if you're running Windows?
[04:04] <sflash> i think it might work better for what im doing, plus its a pentium II celeron processor
[04:04] <LinuxLover> Managu: I have to computers a windows and a Linux.  The Linux won't let me connect to the internet but the Windows computer will.  I already tried switching around the cords but the Linux still would not work.
[04:05] <Managu> LinuxLover: the windows computer is connected to the router?
[04:05] <cocox> what are the more commons switches used with netstat ???
[04:05] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yes both of them are
[04:05] <sflash> but now im having problems getting my shared drive to share to my windows machines.
[04:05] <Managu> LinuxLover: are they close together?  i.e. can you run stuff on your linux machine while you chat on IRC?
[04:06] <LinuxLover> Managu: Side by Side
[04:06] <Marsmensch> anyone here knows a goot guide for sound server?
[04:06] <bsdfox> I need help, I want my lcd monitor on the right to the :1.0 and the CRT to be :1.1 but nothing I do seems to have any effect. nvidia-settings shows the CRT as :1.0 and the DFP as :1.1 I can't get it to change
[04:06] <Managu> LinuxLover: ok.  lemme see.
[04:07] <Managu> LinuxLover: first things first.  Open up the networking control panel on the linux machine (system -> administration -> networking)
[04:07] <LinuxLover> Managu: Ok
[04:08] <Managu> LinuxLover: Ethernet connection: The interface eth0 is active (?)
[04:08] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yes
[04:08] <Managu> LinuxLover: Default gateway device: eth0?
[04:08] <cocox> what are the more commons switches used with netstat ???
[04:08] <LinuxLover> Managu: What do you mean?
[04:09] <Managu> Is there a listbox for "Default gateway device" newr the bottom of your window?  What's it set to?
[04:09] <Managu> cocox: that's just begging for a RTFM.  "man netstat"
[04:09] <titan> how do you get gcc onto Dapper?
[04:09] <LinuxLover> Managu: eth1
[04:10] <Managu> LinuxLover: do you have 2 different network cards in the linux machine?
[04:10] <LinuxLover> Managu: not that I know of I have never Installed one that didnt come with it
[04:10] <cocox> Managu, what is RTFM ? i already check the man but im asking for some knewed and useful combination like -pl dun know ... ?
[04:11] <Managu> !RTFM
[04:11] <ubotu> Managu: Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:11] <Managu> hrmm
[04:11] <Managu> cocox: paraphrasing: Read The Manual
[04:11] <sflash> anyone know how to get my smb.conf file to work properly in my system. i just want to create a public account and share without authentication
[04:12] <Managu> LinuxLover: Ok, so the "Ethernet Connection" has below it "The Interface ...."  ?  Fill in the rest for me
[04:12] <sflash> currently when my network sees my box, if i double click on it, a authentication box pops up
[04:12] <Managu> sflash: let me know if you figure that out.  I never quite got it
[04:13] <Pmancgv> Hello, I have a HP nx9005 notbook , I would like to set my MODEM to work good
[04:13] <LinuxLover> Managu: eth0 is active    The one above says eth1 is active and the one below it is Modem connection: The interface ppp0 is not configured
[04:13] <Managu> LinuxLover: ok.  So, at the very least, Linux thinks you have two ethernet adapters
[04:13] <Pmancgv> anybody know Cuould I ???
[04:13] <sflash> i finally got it to work, but then i reformatted and now i cant anymore
[04:13] <Managu> LinuxLover: switch the default gateway device to eth0
[04:14] <LinuxLover> Mangau: Then try connecting?
[04:14] <elknof1> hi everybody
[04:14] <Managu> LinuxLover: yeah
[04:14] <Managu> LinuxLover: well, close the settings box by pressing "ok", then try connecting (i.e. with a web browser)
[04:15] <LinuxLover> Managu: Still didn't work its not connecting to google.
[04:15] <Managu> linuxlover: ok, let's try this in a shell then, since I can be a bit more succinct
[04:15] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to disable the tapping in the touchpad??   i've tryed adding a line to xorg.conf -option "maxtaptime"  "0"-  and reboot....   but nothing... any clue??
[04:15] <LinuxLover> Managu: A shell?? Like a terminal?
[04:15] <Managu> linuxlover: in a shell "sudo ifdown eth0"; "sudo ifdown eth1"
[04:15] <Managu> LinuxLover: yes, a terminal
[04:16] <titan> how do you get gcc onto Dapper?
[04:16] <Managu> titan: install build-essential
[04:16] <LinuxLover> Managu: What part of it do you want?
[04:16] <Managu> titan: rather, install the package named "build-essential"
[04:16] <Managu> LinuxLover: run those commands, I don't really care about the output
[04:17] <Managu> LinuxLover: after that's done, try "sudo dhclient eth0".  It may take a while
[04:17] <Pmancgv> anybody know, how I set my internal modem to work in my laptop
[04:17] <titan> Managu, oka
[04:17] <titan> okay*
[04:17] <Pmancgv> it is a hp nx9005
=== somegeek_ is now known as somegeek
[04:18] <Managu> LinuxLover: I'm looking for lines that contain "DHCPOFFER" or something similar.  If there aren't any, then try "sudo dhclient eth1"
[04:18] <LinuxLover> Managu: Okay now what?
[04:18] <Managu> LinuxLover: if there are, read out the line to me
[04:19] <LinuxLover> Managu: it says No DHCPOFFER received
[04:19] <Managu> LinuxLover: ok, try "sudo dhclient eth1"
[04:19] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to disable the tapping in the touchpad??   i've tryed adding a line to xorg.conf -option "maxtaptime"  "0"-  and reboot....   but nothing... any clue??
[04:19] <titan> Managu, did that but it still doesn't have gcc
[04:20] <LinuxLover> Managu: It says 'DHCPOFFER from 192.168.0.1 (My router)
[04:20] <Managu> titan: hrmm.  well, worth trying to install gcc then (say, "sudo apt-get install gcc")
[04:20] <Managu> linuxlover: ok.  Let's try "sudo ifup eth1"
[04:20] <LinuxLover> Managu: Okay done
[04:20] <titan> ....
[04:20] <titan> what the deuce!
[04:20] <Managu> linuxlover: so eth1 is your network card.  It might be interesting to figure out what's got eth0 on it
[04:20] <titan> should people just not even use Dapper yet, or what?
[04:21] <titan> I mean, it's a total mess.
[04:21] <titan> as far as package management goes....
[04:21] <LinuxLover> Managu: What could it be?
[04:21] <Managu> linuxlover: when you ping the router's ip, does anything happen?  "ping 192.168.0.1"
[04:21] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yep its ginving me the pings
[04:22] <nixuser> how would I format a floppy disk in ubuntu?
[04:22] <Managu> titan: well, (a) read the channel's topic messages?  (b) Ubuntu's meant to be a desktop os -- so a development environment isn't installed by default
[04:22] <Managu> LinuxLover: and pinging the outside world?
[04:22] <titan> Ubuntu 5.10 worked just fine for whatever I wanted from it....
[04:22] <titan> what distribution would you recommend for someone who doesn't want any crap like this, no matter what they try to do? lol
[04:22] <LinuxLover> Managu: What do you mean? You want me to ping an outside ip?
[04:23] <Managu> LinuxLover: right
[04:23] <nixuser> how would i format a floppy disk in ubuntu?
[04:23] <Managu> titan: pcdos 1.0
[04:23] <LinuxLover> Managu: What ping and how do I stop this one? It's still going.
[04:23] <titan> nixuser, "fdformat /dev/fd0"
[04:23] <LinuxLover> Managu: IP not Ping
[04:23] <Managu> linuxlover: CTRL-C to kill ping
[04:23] <nixuser> from the gui
[04:23] <titan> Managu, and I can run MythTV in PcDOS 1.0?
[04:23] <Managu> titan: nope.  That would be crap =p
[04:23] <nixuser> i need to install a bios flash on the floppy  disk
[04:24] <Managu> linuxlover: and I don't care about the ip address.  Try pinging yahoo.com
[04:24] <Managu> linuxlover (let's see if DNS resolution works, at the least)
[04:24] <titan> ultimately, I'm really looking for a way to get MythTV working on Ubuntu dapper.
[04:24] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yep its pinging
[04:24] <LinuxLover> Managu: about 80 ms
[04:24] <Managu> LinuxLover: ok, web pages?
[04:24] <dmbt> nixuser: Under system tools menu under applications, there is a floppy disk formatter
[04:24] <Managu> titan: there are mythtv packages for dapper
[04:25] <titan> Managu, I tried them and it gave me all kinds of crap
[04:25] <titan> some stuff about wrong SQL syntax when I tried to run mythfilldatabase
[04:25] <nixuser> apparently not in dapper drake
[04:25] <LinuxLover> Managu: Still won't connect It says Unable to connect
[04:25] <Managu> linuxlover: hrmm.  can you connect to the router?
[04:25] <titan> and it wouldn't let me get into the SQL database....
[04:25] <titan> err
[04:25] <titan> I tried to start mythbackend
[04:25] <titan> and it would deny access
[04:26] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yep
[04:26] <Managu> titan: ouch =(
[04:26] <titan> so, if you feel like helping me with that, then that would be great....
[04:26] <Managu> linuxlover: your problem's in your router's setup somewhere, not your ubuntu setup.
[04:26] <irrvi> my alsa driver doesnt work, when I run alsamixer -c 0 it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for hw:0: No such file or directory
[04:26] <titan> otherwise, I've got to at least try compiling from source, and I can't do that without gcc
[04:26] <LinuxLover> Managu: I will try rebooting and such again... I'll be back if it doesnt work Thanks for the help
[04:27] <titan> and when I try to install gcc, I get all kinds of "gcc requires so and so, but umpteeump is to be installed!"
[04:27] <titan> and stupid garbage such as that.
[04:27] <Managu> titan: abarbaccia was offering some help earlier; he suggested trying to fish around for help in #mythtv-users
[04:27] <titan> I've already pleaded my case in there....
[04:27] <Managu> titan: ok, let's see.  Removed all the "us." from everything in /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[04:28] <nixuser> how to format a floppy disk to bootable ms-dos for a bios flash?
[04:28] <KarlsBerg`> what it is this error on xorg log ?
[04:28] <KarlsBerg`>  cannot open device /dev/wacom no such file or directory
[04:28] <lwizardl> if i have a fat32 drive how do i get ubuntu to mount it?
[04:28] <titan> done, Managu, but why?
[04:29] <Managu> titan: that was my point (a) from earlier.  From the topic for #ubuntu: The American (US) repositories are not working - please take the us. out of your /etc/apt/sources.list file. Thank you!
[04:29] <titan> Iwizardl, the partition has to be visible, and then you go "mount -t vfat /dev/<device> <mount point>"
[04:29] <juanca777> hello everyone, I need to configure a cvs server for local use, anyone knows about a good tutorial?
[04:29] <KarlsBerg`> xf86OpenSerial: cannot open device /dev/wacom, no such file or directory
[04:29] <titan> Managu, I must have missed that, sorry....
[04:29] <KarlsBerg`> what is ?
[04:30] <irrvi> my alsa driver doesnt work, when I run alsamixer -c 0 it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for hw:0: No such file or directory
[04:30] <Managu> titan: I'd suggest apt-get update, and then trying apt-get install gcc
[04:30] <blackocellaris> Can anyone help me install a mp3 decoder?  I cant install lame, and I'm getting ticked off with this.  I cant ./configure because there is "no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH"
[04:31] <blackocellaris> I've been on the wiki page of ubuntu, google, etc, for about 3 hours now =/
[04:31] <Managu> blackocellaris: what do you want the mp3 decoder to do?
[04:31] <titan> Package gcc is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[04:31] <titan> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[04:31] <titan> is only available from another source
[04:31] <titan> However the following packages replace it:
[04:31] <titan>   gcc-3.4-doc g++-3.4
[04:31] <titan>   g++-3.4: Depends: gcc-3.4 (>= 3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1) but it is not going to be installed
[04:31] <titan>            Depends: gcc-3.4 (< 3.4.6) but it is not going to be installed
[04:31] <titan>            Depends: libstdc++6-dev (>= 3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1) but it is not going to be installed
[04:31] <blackocellaris> I just want to be able to listen to mp3s.....
[04:31] <titan>   gcc-3.4: Depends: cpp-3.4 (>= 3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1) but it is not going to be installed
[04:31] <titan>            Depends: cpp-3.4 (< 3.4.6) but it is not going to be installed
[04:31] <titan>   libstdc++6-dev: Depends: libc6-dev (>= 2.3.5-1ubuntu4) but it is not installable
[04:31] <Healot> blackocellaris: lame decoder, available on the universe repos
[04:31] <titan> what the devil am I supposed to do with this mess?
[04:31] <Managu> !tell titan about paste
[04:31] <titan> O_O
[04:31] <Healot> don't have to compile
[04:32] <irrvi> my alsa driver doesnt work, when I run alsamixer -c 0 it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for hw:0: No such file or directory
[04:32] <blackocellaris> See, that's the problem.  I dont see lame anywhere in the repos
[04:32] <Healot> the packages "lame" is in universe repos
[04:32] <Healot> sorry "multiverse"
=== irrvi is now known as iRRVi
[04:33] <Healot> btw, to compile and stuff, install "build-essential" package first, blackocellaris
[04:33] <Managu> titan: dunno what to say.  Wait a week, and I bet that fixes itself automatically.  Dapper is still stabilizing (read: changing rapidly).
[04:33] <H080J03> hello
[04:33] <titan> hmmmm....
[04:33] <titan> okay, thanks a lot.
[04:33] <H080J03> what is the command for installing deb packages that you have downloaded your self
[04:33] <blackocellaris> I cant find the lame thing anywhere in the repos, so I'm giving up on that.  Going to try to get the build-essential package now.  thanks
[04:33] <Managu> H080J03: "sudo dpkg -i" followed by the name of the file
[04:34] <H080J03> thx
[04:34] <Managu> blackocellaris: so, errm, what's your objective with finding an mp3 decoder?
[04:34] <Healot> blackocellaris: multiverse!
[04:34] <Healot> add a multiverse repos

[04:34] <titan> when do you think the final release of Dapper will be?
[04:34] <blackocellaris> everything I can possibly do in repos is ticked.
[04:35] <iRRVi> my alsa driver doesnt work, when I run alsamixer -c 0 it says: alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for hw:0: No such file or directory (why no answers?)
[04:35] <Managu> titan: it's scheduled for June 1? Or is it July 1?
[04:35] <Managu> !dapper+1
[04:35] <ubotu> Managu: parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:35] <Managu> !dapper
[04:35] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[04:35] <blackocellaris> My objective is to listen to mp3s, it says I have no audio decoder so that's what I'm after :)
[04:35] <titan> okay
[04:35] <blackocellaris> brb in a couple, I'm on to something with y'alls advice
[04:35] <Healot> blackocellaris: duh... just install xmms or vlc or xine :)
[04:35] <titan> sweet, that's only 8 days.
[04:35] <Managu> !tell blackocellaris about restricted
[04:36] <blackocellaris> I couldnt install them at all, kept getting C compiler errors :X
[04:36] <blackocellaris> Thanktaru :)
[04:36] <Healot> wtf? are you using the deb-src repos? instead of deb?
[04:36] <psYchotic> say, does anyone know of any good text editor nog named gedit with good syntax highlighting?
[04:36] <iRRVi> why must you ignore me?\
[04:37] <psYchotic> *not
[04:37] <Managu> psYchotic: there's a tone
[04:37] <Managu> !tell iRRvi about patience
[04:37] <tripppy> how long after dapper is out. can i request a cd sent to me?
[04:37] <psYchotic> Managu: I'm aware, but none seem to really suit my needs
[04:37] <DBO> iRRVi, everyone here is a vounteer, they will help you if they can, but are not required to.
[04:37] <Managu> psYchotic: kate from KDE is rather nice.  There's emacs and xemacs, which can do everything
[04:37] <Pmancgv> Anybody know Could I set my internal modem to work on ubunut 5.10
[04:38] <psYchotic> Managu: I've tried the following: scite, gedit, leafpad (no syntax highlighting), glimmer (wouldn't even compile), medit (not really what I'm looking for)
[04:38] <Pmancgv> I have a HP nx9005 Laptop
[04:38] <psYchotic> Managu: yeah, I think kate would be what I want
[04:38] <psYchotic> Managu: but I was just wondering if there is any good gnome varian
[04:38] <psYchotic> t
[04:39] <Managu> psYchotic: well, you can use KDE programs without switching to the KDE desktop.  "apt-get install kate" should be fine, albeit it might install a bunch of kde libs
[04:39] <lwizardl> i'm trying to write to a fat32 drive and its write protected (has a lock on folder image) how do i allow write access
[04:39] <blackocellaris> Healot, Managu , my life just got a thousand times easier with y'alls advice.  thanks so much.
[04:39] <psYchotic> Managu: yeah, I have kbluetoothd running =P But I'ma try that
[04:39] <Managu> lwizardl: you'll need to set the default umask to something more permissive, most likely
[04:40] <iRRVi> sorry, its just I'm getting REALLY frustrated, I've been working on this since after school, which, was over hours ago
[04:40] <Marsmensch> !nas
[04:40] <ubotu> Marsmensch: I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:40] <Seq> does anybody know how to add a debian repository that specifies a weird arch (ppc instead of powerpc), or if it is possible?
[04:41] <paco_reyes> hi, is there some problems with lucent orinoco silver and network manager on dapper
[04:41] <paco_reyes> ?
[04:41] <iRRVi> so...I don't get why I was booted, but nvm that
[04:41] <Managu> iRRVi: coulda been a disconecct -- didn't look like a boot to me
[04:42] <hanasaki> where can i get the beta ?
[04:42] <sflash> hi, anyone know how to setup samba correctly?
[04:43] <Managu> sflash: Such a person probably exists.
[04:44] <sflash> it appears not, im in a samba room too and there is no one that is helping
[04:45] <LinuxLover> Managu: I dont think its my router If it was my router it wouldnt let me receive a ping would it?
[04:45] <Managu> linuxlover: it very well might
[04:46] <psYchotic> say, is there a way to make kde programs use the gnome "open file" dialog instead of the kde one?
[04:46] <Managu> linuxlover: there are other options, but they're rather remote, and harder to diagnose
[04:46] <LinuxLover> Managu: Well I reset all the setting to default and its still not working... I think its firefox b/c I went on WinE and it let me open pages On IE
[04:46] <LinuxLover> Managu: But it won't let me get on gaim either
[04:46] <Managu> LinuxLover: oh?  That's interesting
[04:46] <squiggly> !boobies
[04:46] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, squiggly
[04:46] <squiggly> too bad
[04:47] <LinuxLover> Managu: Any ideas now?? Lol I'm confused
[04:47] <Hexidigital_> do i have to install anything to program in perl, or is it already configured in linux?
[04:47] <Managu> so, IE under wine on the linux box works?
[04:47] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yep it does
[04:47] <Managu> hexidigital_: should be read for you
[04:47] <Hexidigital_> Managu:: thanks... wasn't sure... (reading a perl programming book)
[04:47] <Managu> psYchotic: almost certainly not
[04:47] <Managu> psychotic: short of recoding
[04:48] <Managu> hexidigital_: err _ready_ for you ;-)
[04:48] <Healot> Managu, there is a workaround to make IE work on wine... can't remember what's the "URL"
[04:48] <Hexidigital_> :) Managu i understand typo's
[04:48] <psYchotic> Managu: ok, I'll look around on the net, but you're probably right
[04:49] <Managu> LinuxLover: maybe you have your firefox set up to use a web proxy?
[04:49] <LinuxLover> Managu: Let me check quick
[04:49] <Managu> Healot: hrmm, interesting
[04:49] <LinuxLover> Managu: Would that affect Gaim though?
[04:49] <Managu> LinuxLover: it shouldn't, but one program at atime
[04:50] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to disable the tapping in the touchpad??   i've tryed adding a line to xorg.conf -option "maxtaptime"  "0"-  and reboot....   but nothing... any clue??
[04:50] <LinuxLover> Managu: Nope its set to Direct connection to the Internet
[04:50] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to disable the tapping in the touchpad??   i've tryed adding a line to xorg.conf -option "maxtaptime"  "0"-  and reboot....   but nothing... any clue??
[04:50] <elknof1> sorry
[04:50] <Managu> elknof1: I suspect that the tapping is a hardware feature of your touchpad
=== zack__ is now known as zack
[04:51] <Managu> LinuxLover: what happens when you run "wget http://www.yahoo.com/" at a terminal?
[04:52] <elknof1> managu, yes...  is like clicking in the touchpad
[04:52] <LinuxLover> Managu: It just stays at Connection to www.yahoo.com(1.0.0.0):80...
[04:52] <Managu> elknof1: right.  If it's a hardware feature of the pad, you may not be able to "shut it off".  Just a thought.
[04:52] <bsdfox> hmm , can anyone help be set DFP-0 as my primary display (:0.0) and CRT-1 as my secondary display (:0.1)... I just got this multimonitor thing working but it won't run gdm on the DFP! my xorg.conf is at http://pastebin.com/736384
[04:52] <Managu> LinuxLover: whoa, 1.0.0.0?
[04:53] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yes sir
[04:53] <Managu> LinuxLover: what's in your /etc/resolv.conf?  "cat /etc/resolv.conf"
[04:53] <LinuxLover> Managu: Come to think of it it said that when I tried geting on the mrc thing
[04:55] <LinuxLover> Managu: search domain.actdsltmp  namerserver 192.168.0.1 nameserver 205.171.3.65
[04:55] <hanasaki> brezzy is current? dapper is beta? where cna i get the beta?
[04:55] <elknof1> managu, well is a hardware feature of every single lap top in the world -that is equipped with touch pad- but in my last lap top i was able to shut it off, and many can...  im not sure if the line in xorg.conf was well writted or not... but that line supposed to disable tapping...
[04:55] <weese> can anyone help me with a modem configuration problem?? Everything works fine but when I restart I always have to reconfigure my modem (retype the dialup number, user name, password, and detect modem).
[04:55] <blackocellaris> tapping= most annoying thing in the world
[04:56] <mnk> hi guys - can anyone tell me if they have installed cinelerra on dapper?
[04:56] <Managu> linuxlover: mmm.  "gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf".  Remove the "search" and "nameserver 192.168.0.1" lines
[04:56] <intelikey> `whyami`
[04:56] <Managu> imo, touchpads = most annoying input device ever invented
[04:57] <DBO> Managu, clearly you never used a gyro mouse
[04:57] <Managu> bsdfox: at the risk of sounding insulting, have you read through the nvidia documentation
[04:57] <mnk> i am trying to install cinelerra using the instructions here: http://cvs.cinelerra.org/getting_cinelerra.html#ubuntu (replacing brezzy with dapper) but there is this package not available: libopenexr2c2
[04:57] <LinuxLover> Managu: I want to remove the router nameserver from that list?
[04:58] <Managu> DBO: haha, I'm sitting with one right next to me.
[04:58] <Managu> LinuxLover: yes, that's right
[04:58] <mnk> any help would be appreciated pls
[04:58] <Managu> mnk: gotten the standard line yet?
[04:58] <LinuxLover> Managu: This is the second time youve helped me you're a linux god haha
[04:58] <Managu> !tell mnk about dapper
[04:58] <LinuxLover> Managu: Thank you very much
[04:58] <Managu> LinuxLover: that fix anything?
[04:58] <intelikey> mnk libopenexr2c2a - runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
[04:59] <LinuxLover> Managu: Yeah I can use google now HAHA!
[04:59] <Managu> linuxlover: it's likely a temporary fix -- but that suggests that your router is somehow messing up DNS resolution
[04:59] <LinuxLover> Managu: That fixed it all... What were those lines?
[04:59] <mnk> yeah intelikey - where can i get those from?
[04:59] <jcmcbeth> What do I have to do to be able to use my CD Burner because k3b and gnomebaker either freeze when I tell them to burn an image or freeze on startup, or get mostly through the burn and have an error burning the cd?
[05:00] <LinuxLover> jcmcbeth: google burn at once
[05:00] <LinuxLover> jcmcbeth: only certain cd burners can burn ico images
[05:00] <intelikey> mnk in dapper it has the appended  a  on the end...   repos.
[05:00] <intelikey> mnk  apt-cache search blah   is your friend.
[05:00] <bsdfox> Managu, yeah a couple times
[05:00] <Dr_Willis> Huh?  thats the first id ever heard that only some cd burners can burn isos'
[05:00] <jcmcbeth> linuxlover: I had no problems with the burner burning iso's in windows
[05:01] <Dr_Willis> and is there a LINUX port of burn at once? id never seen one.
[05:01] <bsdfox> I do what it says and it just doesn't work
[05:01] <LinuxLover> Dr_Willis: its the truth Really weird
[05:01] <Dr_Willis> LinuxLover,  id like to see proof of that statement.
[05:01] <Managu> bsdfox: I had that stuff working once long ago -- but I installed dapper, and haven't bothered since, heh.  Lemme see if perusing the docs brings anything to mind
[05:01] <LinuxLover> Dr_Willis: I'm not sure but there has to be something like it O.o
[05:01] <intelikey> Dr_Willis ?
[05:01] <LinuxLover> Dr_Willis: I was just trying to help out w/suggestions
[05:01] <LinuxLover> Dr_Willis: What would you like proof of again O.o
[05:02] <jcmcbeth> It appears as though the burn at once site is kaput.
[05:02] <Dr_Willis> jcmcbeth,  you are saying you cant burn cd's with k3b or gnomebaker - and the whole system will freezes? or just the program?
[05:02] <sflash> anyone know that apt-get software for apache and php? is there one with mysql bundles too?
[05:02] <Dr_Willis> !lamp
[05:03] <ubotu> Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, one of the standard internet server installations. Installing LAMP in Ubuntu is fairly straightforward. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[05:03] <odin__> anybody use wine?
[05:03] <jcmcbeth> dr_willis: the program will, usually it just fails to finish burning without giving an error and making a coaster, and it's burning anything, music cd, images, and data cds
[05:03] <intelikey> LinuxLover i'd like proof that "only some cdburners can burn iso's"  ?
[05:03] <Dr_Willis> jcmcbeth,  odd.. could chedk to be sure that dma is enabled on the dvd drive.. and check the output of 'dmesg' see if any errors are showing up
[05:04] <Hexidigital_> odin__:: i drink wine on occasion
[05:04] <intelikey> odin__ with unlevened bread
[05:04] <DW|Sakara|U> alot of people in channel wow
[05:04] <Dr_Willis> >hic<
[05:04] <odin__> mmm ... cultural...
[05:04] <intelikey> odin__ i mean yes.
[05:04] <Hexidigital_> :)
[05:04] <jcmcbeth> Dr_Willis: it all worked fine, and DMA was installed when I was using windows, unless linux disabled it by default
[05:04] <sflash> lamp isnt a package
[05:04] <Healot> i hate LAMP, i use fireflies to light up my house hehe
[05:05] <sflash> or at least thats not the name to download it
[05:05] <Managu> bsdfox: looks like what you're trying to do is covered in Appendix P.  In particular, I notice that the "metamodes" line only pertains to TwinView, and not to having seperate X displays
[05:05] <odin__> intelikey:  well, whenever I try to load a game on it through my windows partition, it crashes
[05:05] <torpedo|dog> sflash, you just install the various components.
[05:05] <Hexidigital_> odin__:: what game?
[05:05] <Dr_Willis> jcmcbeth,  thats what i am saying - be sure linux has dma enabled on it..
[05:05] <DBO> Healot, oh sure thats great for a couple days, but then you have to go get a whole new set of fireflies
[05:05] <Dr_Willis> jcmcbeth,  hdparm /dev/hdc (or whatever)
[05:05] <odin__> intelikey:  of course, I'm not entirely sure how I'm suppose to use it.  one error message I got was a bad window parameter, which I think is because I have dual-monitor screens
[05:05] <sflash> i know there is a lib-apche-php thing
[05:05] <sflash> that installs both
[05:05] <Centaur5> I just installed ubuntu on an pavilion ze2000 and it detected the wireless but the card won't actually turn on because the hardware button doesn't work, what can I do?
[05:05] <odin__> intelikey:  so far I've tried Planescape Torment
[05:06] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  dont use the windows partition to run apps and games.. use wine to reinstall the app/game
[05:06] <LeoDK> Oi Galera, eu sou o PauloHNT... to na maquina do meu irmao. Gostaria de saber como acessar meu pc pela rede. Os arquivos dele estao na minha maquina e quero passar pra ca... alguem pode me ajudar??
[05:06] <intelikey> odin__ hmmm games....  check the winehq site for the list of games that are known to work?
[05:06] <Managu> !tell LeoDK about es
[05:06] <odin__> Dr_Willis:  I was trying that, but I'm not sure how it's done:  do I just insert the game disk and point the installer to /dev/cdrom?
[05:06] <Dr_Willis> you absoultely do Not need to use the windows partitions to use wine.
[05:06] <LeoDK> Qndo vo conectar ele pede uma tela de autenticacao... coloco minha senha e nada
[05:06] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  basicially to the setup.exe on the mounted cdrom
[05:06] <torpedo|dog> LeoDK, go to #ubuntu-pt or #ubuntu-br
[05:06] <intelikey> odin__ wine is not the best for games.
[05:06] <mnk> intelikey - i get  Depends: libopenexr2c2 (>=1.2.2) but it is not installable - however, i have  libopenexr2c2a installed which is 1.2.2-4ubuntu2
[05:07] <DBO> !br
[05:07] <ubotu> Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
[05:07] <odin__> intelikey:  what is the best for games, then?
=== Discipulus1 is now known as Discipulus

[05:07] <TotiR> hi. trying to implement some kind of ayutologout / session time out with gnome. Anyone's done something like that ?
[05:08] <intelikey> odin__ also as Dr_Willis said.  and if it is ntfs don't use the windows part.
[05:08] <voraistos> hey people, i want to create a .img file (containing other files of course) how should i do ?

[05:08] <Xyc0> Cedega
[05:08] <intelikey> odin__ cedega  or  just  vmware & run windows
[05:09] <odin__> intelikey:  vmware sounds like it would be real slow
[05:09] <nathansnook> how does apt-get work
[05:09] <nathansnook> I want to get a package called gocr
[05:09] <nathansnook> it works with sane
[05:09] <Xyc0> voraistos: what is the purpose of the image?
[05:09] <odin__> nathansnook: sudo apt-get install gocr
[05:10] <nathansnook> I want to scan and then convert to he image to a OCR text
[05:10] <voraistos> Xyc0: floppy disk on vmware on Dos
[05:10] <intelikey> odin__ i'm not a gamer  but  wine is kinda limited in the gaming department.   remember wine = wine is not an emulator.
=== lars-ut is now known as lars-ut-away
[05:10] <blackocellaris> Okay, this is a little weird.  To install xmms it says I need a updated version of Glib, to install Glib it says I need a updated gettext support for my C library.  When I install a GNU gettext library it does nothing =/
[05:11] <odin__> intelikey:  oh, I thought it was
[05:11] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: what method are you using to install xmms?
[05:12] <voraistos> Xyc0: all i want is put some files into a .img (to write the .img on a virtual floppy disk drive ;) )
[05:12] <Xyc0> voraistos: I am still not sure what you are trying to accomplish, you want to back up a floppy?
[05:12] <blackocellaris> ./configure in terminal
[05:12] <blackocellaris> compiling it (i'm still new)
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[05:13] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: sometheing as minor as an mp3 player would be a lot easier to just install the package via apt-get
[05:13] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: in terminal type: sudo apt-get xmms
[05:14] <voraistos> Xyc0: the files are on the hard drive, and i have no floppy disk drive on the computer
[05:14] <Xyc0> do you need to add repositories for xmms still?
[05:14] <blackocellaris> E:" INvalid operation xmms
[05:14] <Xyc0> voraistos: but you want to mount the files?
[05:14] <blackocellaris> I just cant open any audio files.  I have beep installed
[05:14] <intelikey> voraistos dd if=/dev/zero of=file.img count=2880 && mkfs.vfat file.img && mount file.img /mount/point  cp files to /mount/point   you then have your files in a disk image you could dd to floppy   :)
[05:15] <blackocellaris> Not that I know of, lemme look at repos again
[05:15] <Xyc0> sigh, sorry blackocellaris im rusty at this
[05:15] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: sudo apt-get install xmms
[05:15] <blackocellaris> Dont be sorry, I appreciate the effort.  I'm still very new so I'm trying to learn along :)
[05:15] <voraistos> intelikey: wow
[05:15] <Healot> blackocellaris: "apt-get install xmms"...

[05:16] <blackocellaris> E: Unable to lock the list directory
[05:16] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: that's great to hear, a good start would be doing a search on ubuntu's wiki page
[05:16] <Healot> blackocellaris: are you opening synaptic?
[05:16] <blackocellaris> I've been trying to do this with wiki for about 4 hours now
[05:16] <blackocellaris> synaptic is open
[05:16] <Healot> CLOSE it :)
[05:16] <voraistos> loooooooooooooooool
[05:16] <LinuxLover> Managu: Remember me? Haha I need that nameserver number again My Modem restarted therefore I need to edit my resolv.conf again.
[05:17] <Healot> then "sudo apt-get install xmms" :)
[05:17] <intelikey> voraistos making disk image files is childs play for linux.

[05:17] <ubotu> hedrek: Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[05:17] <Xyc0> blackocellaris: yea, if you are using synaptic, it will not allow you to manually access apt-get
[05:17] <hedrek> !theme
[05:17] <blackocellaris> Doing it now......it's weird, sometimes I can play a mp3 but 99% of the time I cant.  I hope this works ;)

[05:17] <voraistos> intelikey: i am noob, and so a fetus player. i am not a child yet
[05:18] <Xyc0> sorry to bail out, ill be back online in a bit
[05:18] <LinuxLover> Managu: I didnt add anything haha But now its gone the only thing on there is nameserver and my routers IP
[05:18] <Xyc0> salaam
[05:18] <intelikey> :)
[05:18] <Healot> blackocellaris: new to multimedia for linux?
[05:18] <blackocellaris> I still get the "Please check your soundcard is configured, you have the correct output plugin selected, no other program is blocking the soundcard" error
[05:18] <blackocellaris> yeah =/
[05:19] <Drake_> LinuxLover: previously you had nameserver 205.171.3.65
[05:19] <calamari> hi
[05:19] <blackocellaris> see, wth.....
[05:19] <blackocellaris> I get the error, then I push play and it works.....
[05:19] <LinuxLover> Drake_: Thank you I'm going to check that out
[05:19] <blackocellaris> now I can close the program and do the same thing but it wont work
[05:19] <Managu> LinuxLover: my scrollback has "nameserver 205.171.3.65"
[05:19] <Managu> oops, seems I'm slow, lol

[05:21] <katie_> how do i load pcnet_cs?
[05:21] <Kyral> ubuntu_timhudson: 500 MB
[05:21] <intelikey> voraistos as a beginner may i sujest some very good reading for the "unborn child"  :)
[05:21] <Kyral> but thats only a command line :P
[05:21] <intelikey> !tell voraistos about cli
[05:22] <Healot> ubuntu_timhudson: ranging from 350MB to 1.5GB
[05:22] <blackocellaris> So does that make sense to y'all?  The fact that I cant play a mp3 until about 10 seconds after the program is open?
[05:22] <ubuntu_timhudson> cool, as I only have a 3gig hd w/osx on it
[05:22] <Healot> it doesn't take much, until you have files/app on it
[05:23] <voraistos> intelikey: i know about CLI, using it can be... complicated (however i miss my amstrad 8 Mhz running Msdos 3... but yea, thats for sure different ;) )
[05:23] <ubuntu_timhudson> how do I repartition the HD w/o killing my osx installation
[05:23] <katie_> how do i configure my wireless card i found it is pcnet_cs
[05:23] <Dr_Willis> CP/M rules.
[05:24] <hedrek> !gnome-art
[05:24] <ubotu> hedrek: I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[05:24] <odin__> wine's tellin' me with this game I'm trying to play "no valid video modes" any advice?
[05:24] <Heath> Hey me=LinuxLover
[05:24] <Heath> Thanks again everyone
[05:24] <papichulo> I have WIFI internet with moillafirefox browzer why does it always freez or shut down when I log into my space
[05:24] <katie_> is there a package for pcnet_cs ?
[05:24] <voraistos> intelikey: by the way, i cant make your script work ?! it told me that to mount i had to be root, so i added sudo before mount, but now it tells me file.img is not a block device ?!
[05:25] <intelikey> voraistos the last two of those three links are the ones i had in mind.
[05:25] <Heath> papiculo: try getting the WinE package installing it an installing ie for it
[05:25] <papichulo> I have WIFI internet with mozillafirefox browzer why does it always freez or shut down when I log into my space anyone
[05:25] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  googling and searching the wine forums/wikis  is the place to go.
[05:25] <randomguy> hello
[05:25] <Kyral> because MySpace is shit? :P
[05:25] <Heath> I agree with Kyral
[05:26] <ubuntu_timhudson> well,how do I repartition the HD w/o killing my osx installation
[05:26] <Kyral> Facebook FTW :P
[05:26] <randomguy> i was wondering if it would be a good idea to format your /home fat32 so it will mount in windows when you dual boot
[05:26] <randomguy> is this a good idea?/
[05:26] <Dr_Willis> randomguy,  no need
[05:26] <torpedo|dog> papichulo, if you open a terminal (by going to applications>accessories>terminal, then type mozilla-firefox, and go to Myspace, what appears on the console?
[05:26] <Dr_Willis> windows CAN read/write ext2/3
[05:26] <Kyral> Dr_Willis: HELL NO
[05:26] <sflash> anyone know how to download an internet link to my linux box, im command line only
[05:26] <torpedo|dog> randomguy, no it can't.
[05:26] <randomguy> how so, it doesnt for me
[05:26] <Kyral> Dr_Willis: my friend tried it, he was digging files out of lost+found for a WEEK
[05:27] <DBO> Kyral, please follow the CoC with regards to language usage
[05:27] <Kyral> DBO I didn't curse....
[05:27] <randomguy> ya i know it cant because i have been dualbooting for a year now
[05:27] <Dr_Willis> Kyral,  ive used it for months --> www.fs-driver.org/     and have had no issues with it... theres severtal ways to do it.
[05:27] <intelikey> voraistos i didn't intend for you to just cp/paste that line... :)   the mount command would look like.    " sudo mount -o loop file.img /mount/point "   where file.img  and mount/point  are an example.   mount/point must be a dir.
[05:28] <DBO> Kyral, twice by my count
[05:28] <voraistos> intelikey; yea, i used my dir ;) i am not THAT bad
[05:28] <ubuntu_timhudson> does anyone know?
[05:28] <Kyral> DBO, hell isn't swearing in my book
[05:28] <randomguy> just for future reference would formating /home as fat32 work?
[05:28] <torpedo|dog> randomguy, it would kind of work.
[05:28] <DBO> Kyral, you might find the ops disagree, Im just warning you, they are hard and fast about these rules...
[05:29] <torpedo|dog> You'd get your homedir readable by Windows, but it would lose all of the good things that come with an ext(2/3) filesystem.
[05:29] <Kyral> DBO Believe me I know *points to his cloak*
[05:29] <DBO> ouch my foot
[05:29] <randomguy> ya i would lose metajounaling but i dont necessarily need any of those features for /home itself, or at least i dont think so
[05:30] <intelikey> voraistos also the way i gave the first example you would have to inturpret cp files to /mount/point   as something like "cp /dir/blah ~/blah.* /mount/point "
[05:30] <sflash> any way to download a internet file using command line in ubuntu?
[05:30] <randomguy> '/ would still be ext3
[05:30] <Dr_Willis> sflash,  wget http://whatever.com/foo.file
[05:30] <DBO> wget file
[05:30] <torpedo|dog> randomguy, I'd recommend just putting a /home/yourname/winshare directory in your homedir
[05:30] <torpedo|dog> that's what I've done.
[05:30] <sflash> ok, puts it in the directory im in too?
[05:31] <torpedo|dog> sflash, you could also use lynx, a basic web browser.
[05:31] <intelikey> <voraistos> intelikey; yea, i used my dir ;) <---- i hope that does not mean " $HOME "    ?
[05:31] <ircrob> Does the installer resize NTFS ?
[05:31] <voraistos> intelikey: nope
[05:31] <voraistos> duke3d that was ;)
[05:31] <DBO> ircrob, yes, but it simply trucates it, so it will result in data loss of anything at the end of the partition
[05:31] <torpedo|dog> ircrob, yes it does.
[05:31] <torpedo|dog> DBO, I don't think that's quite accurate
[05:32] <intelikey> k
[05:32] <torpedo|dog> if there's data there, it should fail gracefully.
[05:32] <katie_> is there a package for pcnet_cs ?
[05:32] <katie_> pcmcia_cs?
[05:32] <DBO> torpedo|dog, ok, well either way it cant move the data
[05:33] <katie_> cant get my wireless card to work
[05:33] <Eleaf> mmmmmm
[05:34] <intelikey> voraistos just a helpful note, if you have some free time  do   man bash   and at least skim it hitting the high lights.     anyone that liked dos will love bash.  but you need to note some of the major differances.
[05:34] <katie_> it is sohoware nc5120
[05:34] <katie_> which i think is pcnet_cs
[05:34] <Dr_Willis> Ive used the ubuntu installer to resize  ntfs partitions with no data loss..  did this a long time ago on a new laptop. (i think)
[05:34] <katie_> i right click on it an it says active eth1
[05:35] <katie_> turn off eth0 and i dont get anything
[05:35] <voraistos> intelikey: yea i remember i did that when i was running debian ;)
[05:35] <Dr_Willis> but i find it better to use a live cd with gparted. (or course defrag/scandisk your windows drive BEFOR messing with it.. then again after)
[05:35] <randomguy> you can resize an ntfs file system as long as there is no data at that point on the partition
[05:35] <ircrob> Dr_Willis: Good to know
[05:36] <katie_> is there a channel that knows about wireless cards and ubuntu?
[05:36] <voraistos> intelikey: i loved browsing the web in command mode, and msn my friends as well in some other tty...
[05:36] <Dr_Willis> ircrob,  yea - its a habbit from long time ago. :P
[05:36] <voraistos> intelikey: i mean on debian, not on DOS !
[05:37] <Dr_Willis> randomguy,   thus you need to defrag first. ;) i guess.
[05:37] <katie_> kalamazoo
[05:37] <Heath> Hey is unblocking port 80 for incoming traffic a bad security risk?
[05:37] <randomguy> ya defrag would be a good idea so long as there is enough free space on the drive in the first place
[05:37] <randomguy> otherwise you are not in much luck
[05:38] <Managu_away> Heath: depends what's listening on port 80
[05:38] <Heath> Managu_away: HTTP is what its supposed to be
[05:38] <Kyral> Heath: if you are running Apache no
[05:38] <Juhaz> Heath, if you know what you're doing, and keep your apache and other related stuff up to date, it's pretty safe
[05:38] <Heath> Okay Thanks
[05:39] <intelikey> N=0 ;for l in {A..z} ;do N=$((1 + $N)) ;echo -e "$N $l   \c" ;done | fold -s
[05:39] <intelikey> things that do nothing.
[05:39] <Heath> I am trying to run ssh but I am behind a router and I forwarded port 22 and port 80 for it and the person trying to connect still can't connect to it is there a reason why that you guys can think of?
[05:40] <Managu_away> Heath: firestarter comes to mind
[05:40] <Heath> Managu_away: And firestarter=what?
[05:40] <sflash> whats the commandline to copy directory over and its contents?
[05:41] <intelikey> sflash man cp
[05:41] <Kyral> sflash: cp -r <srcdir> <destdir>
[05:41] <intelikey> -R
[05:41] <Kyral> -r
[05:41] <Heath> -r
[05:41] <Kyral> -R is for like chmod or chown
[05:42] <intelikey> man cp
[05:42] <Managu_away> Heath: (very roughly speaking) a personal firewall for Linux.  The control program (at least under 5.10) is somewhere in the applications menu.  You'd want to shut the firewall off (easy, not a good idea security-wize), or poke a hole through it (better security-wise, harder to implement)
[05:42] <intelikey> :)
[05:42] <Heath> Managu_away: I'll check it out in synaptic
[05:43] <Heath> Are there alot of people that hack just linuxs and write linux viruses?
[05:43] <sflash> it didnt work
[05:43] <sflash> sudo cp -r html /var/www
[05:43] <nomasteryoda> Heath, nopee
[05:43] <torpedo|dog> Heath, there are few to none Linux viruses.
[05:44] <Kyral> Heath: that is the funniest thing I have heard all day :P
[05:44] <Managu_away> A few.  They're significantly less common than Windows viruses
[05:44] <sflash> is there another command?
=== [1] wenko is now known as wenko
[05:44] <nomasteryoda> and they would only affect the users account not the whole system
[05:44] <Heath> Didn't think so I was told by someone else there were so I thought id ask
[05:44] <intelikey> sflash you prolly dont own the destination.....  man sudo
[05:44] <sflash> i did, looke at what wrote
[05:44] <sflash> sudo cp -r html /var/www
[05:44] <sflash> didnt work
[05:45] <intelikey> sflash is html a dir ?
[05:45] <sflash> yes
[05:45] <nomasteryoda> linux was designed with the Internet in mind ... before gates said "The Internet? We're not interested"
[05:45] <Heath> How do I get ssh running?
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> !info ssh
[05:45] <ubotu> ssh: (Secure shell client and server (transitional package)), section net, is optional. Version: 1:4.1p1-7ubuntu4.1 (breezy), Packaged size: 1 kB, Installed size: 32 kB
[05:45] <odin__> does anybody in here work with raid-0 setups at all (or have in the past)?
[05:45] <Heath> Ty
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  i have - but dident find them worth the effort
[05:45] <Heath> My ssh failed to start anyone have any ideas why?
[05:46] <odin__> Dr_Willis:  really?
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  yep.
[05:46] <intelikey> sflash actually i saw what you wrote... i'm lagging here.   what you wrote was on my screen after what i wrote.... i know that you typed it first.... but i can only read what is on my screen...
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  boils down to - do you really need the benifits.. vs the potential problems
[05:46] <sflash> its cool intelikey.
[05:47] <odin__> Dr_Willis:  what're the potential problems?  I read something about if one device fails it's game over, but it doesn't really explain how so
[05:47] <sflash> sudo cp -r html /var/www, that command nothing happens. if i get rid of sudo, i get permission errors. justly so
[05:47] <sflash> but why does the sudo not even do anything, no error or nothing
[05:47] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  depends on the raid type.. the data is half on 1 drive and half on the other... if 1 drive dies.. half the data is gone.
[05:48] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  theres a great many web sites that discuss the different raid types.
[05:48] <[2] Random_guy> back
[05:48] <odin__> Dr_Willis:  actually, I heard that with raid-0, if one drive dies, the other drive can rebuild the lost drive once its replaced
[05:48] <[2] Random_guy> does anyone use freenx java applet with apache?
[05:48] <Heath> Anyone have any ideas why my OpenBSD Secure Shell server is refusing to start?
[05:49] <intelikey> sflash one possable reason... sudo borked.  test with this.    sudo echo ok
[05:49] <Dr_Willis> odin__,  then you have cut your 'drive space' in half.. and writes are slower..
[05:49] <Drake_> generally raid is used to mirror data on multiple drives and can be combined to write some data to each drive and to mirror to a second set of drives also which gets the speed and the redudancy also
[05:49] <sflash> i get ok
[05:49] <[2] Random_guy> anyone use freenx?
[05:49] <sflash> so it does run
[05:49] <intelikey> sflash if it says ok the it's not sudo's fault.
[05:50] <intelikey> s/the/then
=== ethan_ is now known as Eleaf
[05:50] <intelikey> sflash ls /var/www
[05:51] <jmoncayo> how can i play .wmv files?
[05:51] <Heath> Anyone have any ideas why my OpenBSD Secure Shell server is refusing to start?
[05:51] <Dr_Willis> jmoncayo,  depends on the codecs.. some will not be playable.
[05:51] <intelikey> !restricted
[05:51] <ubotu> it has been said that restricted is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats  Most of the formats listed there can be replaced by !FreeFormats
[05:51] <Dr_Willis> Heath,  not with out a clue as to any error messages, or perhaps check the logs
[05:52] <jmoncayo> Dr_Willis, if they are playable how should i open them?
[05:52] <Heath> Dr_Willis: There is nothing about ssh in the logs... Its really weird
[05:52] <Dr_Willis> jmoncayo,  xine, vlc, mplayer, pick one.. try them all...
[05:52] <intelikey> sflash ?
[05:52] <nomasteryoda> vlc is very good..
[05:52] <Heath> Dr_Willis: Plus I already told you the error it says Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server... [fail] 
[05:52] <odin__> at least how much memory do you need for ubuntu?  20gig?
[05:53] <wenko> lol
[05:53] <Dr_Willis> Heath,  thats not actly an 'error message' :P its more of a statement..   aka: you saying "its broke" :P
[05:53] <intelikey> Heath what does sudo /etc/init.d/ssh* start say ?
[05:53] <bk> Does anyone know about the /etc/passwd file?  Should it have a user named 'nobody'?
[05:54] <Heath> intellikey: Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server...      [fail] 
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> bk --> nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh
[05:54] <intelikey> odin__ i've ran ub in 32m  but you can't install it there. you have to have 64 to install and it's hard with that.
[05:54] <ablyss> the secure shell is started when someone logins, right?
[05:54] <bk> Dr_Willis, yeah.  You have it too?
[05:54] <Dr_Willis> bk,  i imagine everyone does :)
[05:54] <odin__> intelikey:  64 megs?
[05:54] <ablyss> it doesn't run like a normal server per se, right?
[05:54] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> how do I clean my dpkg.log and /var/log?
[05:54] <Healot>  hey, trivia, anyone formatted their partition with Amoeba fs before?
[05:55] <intelikey> Heath try restart
[05:55] <Heath> Okay I will again..
[05:55] <ablyss> i would try typing ssh localhost
[05:55] <jmoncayo> Dr_Willis, how can i install mplayer
[05:55] <intelikey> Dr_Willis /bin/sh ????   maybe /bin/false
[05:55] <intelikey> odin__ yes
[05:55] <odin__> bk:  mine does
[05:55] <jmoncayo> i tried aptitude install mplayer and it doesnt works
[05:55] <bk> Dr_Willis, okay.  I'm just going over securing my system, following a book I'm reading.  It says to check for any suspicious users.  I thought that might have been one, but it looks like it isn't.  Thanks for the help guys.
[05:56] <Dr_Willis> bk,  some services run as that user.
[05:56] <intelikey> heath noooooo
[05:56] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> How do I clean my dpkg.log? (System Log File)
[05:56] <intelikey> hehhe i didn't mean restart the computer.... i meant for him to try erstart in place of start on the init script.....
[05:57] <bk> jmoncayo, I would use the Synaptic Package Manager.
[05:57] <TotiR> tx good night.
[05:57] <jmoncayo> what about .mov files??
[05:58] <Healot> you may need a third party package "w32codecs" from seveas' repos i think
[05:59] <intelikey> xxxBrAnDoNxxx you can rm logs in /var/log/  safely.  but it's not always a good idea to rm the latest logs.... security records and such being what they are.
[05:59] <bk> jmoncayo, or I would follow the instructions shown on this webpage http://easylinux.info/wiki/Ubuntu.  I have been able to play all video files I've attempted except .wmv.  If anyone knows, please let me know.
[05:59] <jmoncayo> Healot, for mov files?
[05:59] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> k Thankyou! :)
[06:00] <brandon_> how do i use the google search feature?
[06:00] <papichulo> to any one: Why does my browzer always freez or shut down when I try o go into my space.com? any one
[06:00] <octan_> <brandon_ google gor it :P
[06:00] <octan_> *gor /for
[06:00] <brandon_> i tried that
[06:00] <odin__> is it easy to work with slave hard drives in ubuntu?
[06:01] <octan_> <brandon_> lol
[06:01] <Healot> odin__: define easy
[06:01] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> intelikey, it won't let me sudo rm it. lol any other ideas?
[06:01] <intelikey> search feature in what ?
[06:01] <octan_> <brandon_> + - ! & bla bla bla
[06:01] <Healot> linux can be installed in virtually any drive on connector type on any partitions
[06:01] <brandon_> irc
[06:01] <intelikey> odin__ very
[06:02] <brandon_> i've seen people do google searches in here
[06:02] <papichulo> you guys suck  thanks for nothing
[06:02] <Healot> google search in irc channel?
[06:02] <octan_> <brandon_> ahh you mean the bot
[06:02] <Healot> are you thinking of google bots?
[06:03] <Dr_Willis> Myspace.com uses a lot of funky featres that are only in IE..
[06:03] <brandon_> i suppose i are
[06:03] <Dr_Willis> i think.
[06:03] <octan_> !bot
[06:03] <ubotu> Yep, that's me! I'm a bot alright. Read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbotuUsage to find out how to use me. Do NOT play with me in any channel except #debian-bots.
[06:03] <Dr_Willis> or am i thinking of that MS thing.
[06:03] <intelikey> odin__ ide's nomanclature is  hda=first ide master   hdb=first ide slave   hdc=second ide master ....    partitions on disk are sub numbers   hda1  hdc5  and so on.  you simply mount them.
[06:03] <raptix> hey folks
[06:03] <papichulo> hello
[06:03] <eggzeck> papichulo, your error description isn't enough. And there could be numerous reasons, no way for us to tell so easy anyways.
[06:03] <odin__> intelikey:  and they don't need any os installed on 'em, right?
[06:04] <Dr_Willis> hello? heh - yell at us one sec.. then be nice the next. :P
[06:04] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> I have another question. How do I clean up my previous commands in the termal?
[06:04] <raptix> im getting ubuntu because i think it'd work with my negear wg311t network card, woot, imagine that, *boots up livecd* and gets wifi working within minutes :D
[06:04] <Dr_Willis> xxxBrAnDoNxxx,  check the 'history' command. it can clear out the history
[06:05] <raptix> so many problems wit my debian will go away i reckon :)
[06:05] <papichulo> eggzeck could it be because I have WIFI conection??
[06:05] <eggzeck> xxxBrAnDoNxxx, rm ~/.bash_history
[06:05] <eggzeck> xxxBrAnDoNxxx, that is another way
[06:06] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> K, thankyou all for helping me! :)
[06:06] <cwillu> the days are changing;  used to be python had all the modules and ruby was annoying stark;  but it seems ruby's the one with workable pam support;  oh well
[06:06] <webonomic> I am having issues with my CDROM when installing.  I need to either point the installation to an ISO file on my HD or to an FTP server, how do I do this at the boot prompt?
[06:06] <eggzeck> papichulo, shouldn't be, but it can play a part though.
[06:06] <intelikey> odin__ if there is a file system. you can mount it.  no matter what data may or may not be there.   one can even make a file system on the disk without a partition table, (not recomended)  and mount it.   example.   sudo mke2fs -c /dev/hdb  && mount /dev/hdb /mnt     "i have ubuntu installed on one box that way."
[06:07] <raptix> wow that's a really odd problem webonomic, how olds the pc? specs wise?
[06:07] <Centaur5> Is there a way to make a wireless card turn on if the hardware button won't do it?
[06:07] <odin__> intelikey: thx
[06:07] <webonomic> it's an acer travelmate
[06:07] <Rug> Howdy all
[06:07] <webonomic> celeron 650
[06:07] <webonomic> 256 MB of ram
[06:07] <raptix> hmm
[06:07] <webonomic> currently is running Mandriva 2006
[06:07] <raptix> sounds good, i wonder what it is
[06:08] <webonomic> I thought there would be a switch option at the boot prompt
[06:08] <raptix> is it only when installing?
[06:08] <papichulo> eggzeck, is there any way I can upgrade my browzer or not?
[06:08] <webonomic> like -ftp or something
[06:08] <intelikey> odin__ i should add.  ntfs should be mounted ro  and not writen to... linux doesn't fully support ntfs at this time.
[06:08] <eggzeck> papichulo, it isn't your browser.
[06:08] <odin__> intelikey:  so I've heard, thanks for the warning
[06:08] <eggzeck> papichulo, you're using ff?
[06:08] <webonomic> when it installs, I can get to the boot prompt, then when it scans my cdrom, it goes SOOOOOOO slow
[06:08] <papichulo> yes
[06:09] <webonomic> it's scanning the CD-ROM right now and is stuck at 4%
[06:09] <eggzeck> papichulo, then it isn't your browser, it works fine for me :)
[06:09] <webonomic> been like that for 2 hours
[06:09] <voraistos> trash the CD
[06:09] <The> does anyone know how to upgrade Open Office ???
[06:09] <raptix> is this the first time you've done so (silly question)
[06:09] <The> cant figure it out
[06:09] <webonomic> I've tried 4 different CD's
[06:09] <raptix> ohh i see
[06:09] <raptix> yea sounds effed.
[06:09] <CharlesE> Can someone explain why ubuntu detects both my wireless\built in lan yet it does not detect anything via dchp (or whatever it is called) it makes no sense to me as the computer i am using is old and i used to have no problems with ubuntu running off it
[06:10] <webonomic> but if I can get to the boot prompt, can't I do some kind of other install option?
[06:10] <intelikey> hmmm this tower has eight drives in it... nice!
[06:10] <spikeb> very nice intelikey
[06:10] <webonomic> I tried a PXE boot with a windows server hosting the files, but no luck
[06:10] <odin__> is there any way to remove a directory and every directory/file that's inside of it?  gettin' tired of having to empty directories first
[06:10] <elknof1> hey
[06:10] <elknof1> hi everybody
[06:10] <papichulo> k thanks eggzeck you the man!.............

[06:11] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to enable the s-video out in totem??
[06:11] <Rug> The: Don't yell please
[06:11] <raptix> i can't think of a solution personally, seems like an annoying issue, that may have an easy fix
[06:11] <elknof1> s-video is already working, but i cant see the movie on it...
[06:11] <odin__> oh, it's in rm, not rmdir
[06:12] <voraistos> The: wait for an update/ nu version before to upgrade ;)
[06:12] <The> isn't version 2.0.2 out???/
[06:12] <bimberi> The: no need to shout...
[06:12] <bimberi> !ooo2
[06:12] <ubotu> To upgrade to OOo 2.0.x, see http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-October/012520.html (add one of the 'deb' lines to sources.list and update+upgrade)
[06:12] <intelikey> odin__ man rm
[06:12] <The> not shouting sorry if it seems like that
[06:12] <spikeb> man rm, but NOT rm man
[06:12] <spikeb> hee hee
[06:12] <odin__> intelikey:  yeah, seein' it ... so does -r just remove everything inside the current directory?
[06:12] <webonomic> yeah, Im searching for a solution but no luck yet.  A google search hints that I can install from an FTP server or even an ISO off of the hard drive but I can't find how
[06:13] <bimberi> The: np :)
[06:13] <intelikey> odin__ man is your friend :)
[06:13] <odin__> intelikey:  yeah, it's just that I was using man on rmdir instead
[06:13] <intelikey> man is linux' best friend.
[06:13] <Heath> Hey anyone in here know much about ports?
[06:13] <eggzeck> alias man='woman'
[06:14] <eggzeck> now woman is too :p
[06:14] <intelikey> odin__ it removes what ever you specify -r(ercursively)  i.e.   rm -r  /blah  gets /blah and all that /blah holds.
[06:15] <odin__> intelikey:  ah, so it works on directories themselves?  too used to using rmdir only for such things
[06:15] <VR_> where's the config thing in dapper? i forget what it's called.
[06:15] <intelikey> eggzeck no not woman.... info maybe...
[06:15] <VR_> i guess you could say, the equivalent of regedit.
[06:15] <eggzeck> intelikey, huh?
=== jmoncayo is now known as jmoncayo2
[06:16] <eggzeck> intelikey, alias man='woman' - is what I did ;)
=== jmoncayo2 is now known as jmoncayo
[06:16] <Heath> Hey can someone try connecting to me through my port 80?
[06:16] <Healot> freaking...
[06:16] <eggzeck> intelikey, hence why I said "now woman is too" :)
[06:16] <intelikey> eggzeck nm  :)
[06:16] <Heath> All you need is an internet window up
[06:16] <mosty> i'm trying to figure out how to use initramfs-tools, from the local-bottom script, is the real root fs already mounted on / or somewhere else?
[06:17] <Heath> http://192.168.0.4/ Could someone see if they can get on that?
[06:17] <ic56> intelikey: there *is* a program called woman.  It is an advanced version of man, supporting additional flags for better control.  Dunno if it's still around but it sure was good!
[06:17] <voraistos> heath ?
[06:17] <crimsun> that's an internal IP, Heath, so no.
[06:17] <intelikey> eggzeck i see.
[06:17] <intelikey> man man
[06:17] <intelikey> hmmmm
[06:17] <eggzeck> Healot, no, do you have apache installed?
[06:17] <eggzeck> oops
[06:17] <bimberi> VR_: ok, it's Configuration Editor and is in the System Tools menu.  Both are disabled by default.  You need to edit the menus (right-click on "Applications" to enable them)
[06:17] <Healot> Healot: only on your local subnet
[06:17] <The> where is sources.list located? /
[06:17] <eggzeck> Heath, nope, do you have apache?
[06:17] <Heath> Yes
[06:17] <bimberi> The: /etc/apt
[06:17] <Heath> Apache2
[06:17] <eggzeck> damn, so many people with nicks nearly the same
[06:17] <The> danka
[06:17] <Flannel> Heath: that's a LAN address, your address on your local subnet.
[06:18] <eggzeck> Heath, is it running?
[06:18] <intelikey> man woman
[06:18] <intelikey> E: no manual found for woman
[06:18] <Heath> Yes

[06:18] <bk> Heath, what kind of router are you using?
[06:18] <voraistos> heath: what do u mean ?
[06:18] <voraistos> lol
[06:18] <eggzeck> intelikey, do you know what 'alias' does?
[06:18] <Flannel> Heath: use a webpage, like... http://whatismyip.com and port forward through your router
[06:18] <mosty> anyone know where i can find help with initramfs-tools?
[06:18] <Heath> Cable internet router Actiontec GT701-WG

[06:19] <intelikey> eggzeck do you ?
[06:19] <intelikey> :)
[06:19] <Heath> Thats my router
[06:19] <Heath> Then what?
[06:19] <bk> Heath, that should take you to your router's configuration menu
[06:19] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to watch a movie in totem by the s-video out??
[06:19] <Heath> bk: Yep I know
[06:19] <daddyyankke> I dont understand
[06:19] <Heath> bk: Then what?
[06:19] <elknof1> the svideo out is already working
[06:20] <bk> Heath, in there there should be something called Virtual Server or something
[06:20] <zack___> what program would i use for audio editing? i need to cut out the first few moments of this .wav file
[06:20] <daddyyankke> healot: help
[06:20] <mosty> zack: audacity is simple
[06:20] <voraistos> heath: this guy is gonna make u open some ports, that can be dangerous. What do u wanna do ?
[06:20] <Heath> bk: only server I see in advanced settings is DHCP Server
[06:20] <bk> Heath, that allows you to connect to your computer when someone puts in your IP address.
[06:20] <eggzeck> intelikey, then doing this: alias man='woman', then I could type: woman rm (and get same result as 'man rm'). bleh, now you're getting smart, when I was just trying to make a simple joke about your saying "man is linux' best friend", I said "now woman is too" heh
[06:21] <zack___> mosty thanks ill try that
[06:21] <Heath> voraistos: I need to allow someone to access my computer I have apache2 I want to host my website on it

[06:21] <eggzeck> what the heck
[06:21] <VR_> bimberi: i can't check the checkbox for "system tools." it wont let me.
[06:22] <voraistos> Heath: all u need is to forward your port 80
[06:22] <bk> Heath, according to the user list, your IP is 71.32.131.251.  If someone tried to ssh into it and you had your router set up correctly, you could get into your computer remotely.
[06:22] <Heath> voraistos: I already did but its not working

[06:23] <Some_Person> how to install ubuntu without changing MBR.
[06:23] <Heath> voraistos: The only person that can access it is me
[06:23] <intelikey> eggzeck sorry.   and yes i caught your joke.  it didn't fly by me.   i'm just foul humoured today, i guess.
[06:23] <VR_> bimberi: nevermind, i got it
[06:23] <Some_Person> I have no flippy drive.
[06:23] <bimberi> VR_: yes, you need to enable an entry within it - click on the System Tools on the LHS
[06:23] <mosty> zack: no idea. it just works here.
[06:23] <zack___> mosty ok thanks
[06:23] <bimberi> VR_: yep, it took me about that long to work it out too :P
[06:23] <voraistos> heath: can u give me your IP ?
[06:23] <Eleaf> don don don ...
[06:23] <voraistos> heath: your internet IP ?
[06:24] <bk> Voraistos, Heath's IP address is 71.32.131.251
[06:24] <ic56> eggzeck: you have it backwards.  For what you want to achieve, you should issue "alias woman=man".
[06:24] <Eleaf> Just kidding..
[06:24] <Heath> voraistos: 71.32.131.251
[06:24] <Eleaf> lol
[06:24] <VR_> bimberi: thanks. they shouldn't have changed stuff around! =|
[06:24] <eggzeck> ic56, yeah I noticed too late hehe
[06:24] <raptix> :)
[06:24] <Some_Person> How to install ubuntu without changing the MBR without a flippy drive???
[06:24] <eggzeck> intelikey, haha, I guess it wasn't that funny anyways, =D
[06:24] <bk> Heath, do you know how i know?  Look at the user list to the right of this program.
[06:24] <Heath> Eleaf it is easy to find ips
[06:24] <intelikey> Some_Person expert mode.  and don't let it install grub  but continue without a boot loader   option in sted.
[06:24] <Heath> bk: I can't see it..
[06:24] <Heath> bk: I can't see the user list
[06:25] <bimberi> VR_: a desire to 'keep it simple' methinks
[06:25] <voraistos> heath: i am not too much of a network guy, but isnt that a category b IP adress ?
[06:25] <Heath> voraistos: I have no idea
[06:25] <Some_Person> I want to use NTLDR
[06:25] <Eleaf> Heath, unless you don't have an ip.
[06:25] <Eleaf> instead you have an... IP..
[06:25] <voraistos> nope
[06:25] <Eleaf> Which has larger letters
[06:25] <Heath> Eleaf: wtf are you going on about?
[06:26] <Some_Person> I want it to wait 3 seconds for me to choose, and if i don't choose, to start windows
[06:26] <Eleaf> Heath, it is quite vast.
[06:26] <intelikey> Some_Person may i ask how you plan on booting linux ?
[06:26] <VR_> it's simple enough
[06:26] <zack___> it seems Audacity doesnt see my sound card, how do i see if its working properly
[06:26] <raptix> someone invent a hankechief that doesn't wet up after you sneeze in one part, and feels all guey on the other side, cmon we need a geek to do that
[06:26] <voraistos> heath: can u acess for sure your server:80 from your internal network ?
[06:27] <Heath> yes voraistos
[06:27] <disinterested_pe> im guessing that tjhis site is down or no longer exists ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20050412-0.4_i386.deb
[06:27] <Heath> voraistos and bk I will be right back
[06:27] <Some_Person> i want NTLDR to give two choices
[06:27] <voraistos> heath: then its your router that sucks, quite for sure
[06:27] <ic56> looks like Linux man has absorbed the woman functionality -- at least as much of it as I remember, like the -w, -m, and -l flags.
[06:27] <intelikey> Some_Person what is the present boot manager ?
[06:27] <Heath> voraistos: I think I figured it out
[06:27] <Some_Person> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=56723
[06:27] <Some_Person> I want that
[06:28] <Some_Person> But I have no flippy drive/
[06:28] <Healot> Some_Person": try to use "bootpart"
[06:28] <Some_Person> no
[06:28] <Healot> it can create those dd stuff in windows
[06:28] <Some_Person> I must use NTLDR (windows boot manager)
[06:29] <Healot> and add the boot menu to your boot.ini (ntldr config file)
[06:29] <Dr_Willis> My Motherboard/bios lets me hit F11 at boot time.. and pick what hd to boot.. i can thus have linux and grub on hdb - and boot it - without messing with hda at all  :)
[06:29] <Some_Person> what is bootpart?
[06:29] <Healot> google for bootpart, Some_Person
[06:29] <zack___> what program would i use for audio editing? i need to cut out the first few moments of this .wav file. audacity doesnt seem to work.
[06:29] <Healot> the best bs for dualbooting with windows ntdlr
[06:29] <Some_Person> does it use NTLDR?
[06:29] <Some_Person> good
[06:29] <Healot> no!
[06:29] <intelikey> Some_Person as to ntldr,  i don't support it.  sorry.
[06:30] <Some_Person> cool
[06:30] <Some_Person> bootpart looks good
[06:30] <disinterested_pe> is there anywhere else to get wmv codecs for realplayer than that site i posted?
[06:30] <Some_Person> Does it support GRUB?
[06:31] <zack___> what program would i use for audio editing? i need to cut out the first few moments of this .wav file. audacity doesnt seem to work.
[06:31] <Dr_Willis> disinterested_pe,  mplayers homepage is where i normally get the latest codec packages from
[06:31] <Apostle^> I have a complicated question, I have to share this computer with somone else (unfortunatly) and i want to use xfce, they want to use gnome and i want to be able to switch between users flawlessly (without logging the other one off) how do i accomplish this? (breezy badger)
[06:31] <Healot> Some_Person: let's talk in pvt for explaination
[06:31] <intelikey> disinterested_pe Seveas
[06:31] <disinterested_pe> thoes wont work for realplayer will they?
[06:31] <DrBanzai> So, does anybody really understand why the Mesa stuff still comes up, even after the fglrx drivers have been installed?
[06:31] <Dr_Willis> apokryphos,  could spawn a 2nd X session. but i think the gnome in dapper has a similer feature allready
=== nalioth is now known as nalioth_zZz
[06:32] <intelikey> disinterested_pe don't get me started lying about it... it's not my turn.
[06:32] <Some_Person> could I just install GRUB to a Fat16 partition?
[06:32] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, was that pointed towards me?
[06:32] <disinterested_pe> ok lol
[06:32] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, and i'm on breezy.
[06:32] <Some_Person> and copy the file to windows?
[06:32] <Some_Person> and add the line in boot.ini
[06:32] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  yea.. ya could just start a 2nd x session.. but its a bit of an annoyance
[06:33] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, can you explain that to me, and would it hurt performance?
[06:33] <Some_Person> hello?
[06:33] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  you would be running 2 instances of X - so of course there would be some loss.
[06:33] <Elazar> Anyone know of any good GUI design tools for Ubuntu that aren't specific to a language?
[06:34] <intelikey> hmmm grub does support vfat install i think... check the grub docs
[06:34] <spikeb> Elazar: hmm
[06:34] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, i see, right now i have the gnome quick switch applet but it forces me to use gnome on both users
[06:34] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  in the gnome menus - see if theres a 'login in new session' or somthing similer.
[06:34] <spikeb> Elazar: does the toolkit matter?
[06:34] <Some_Person> oh, but would that auto-boot  ubuntu?
[06:34] <Elazar> spikeb: All I want to do is lay out GUI components, in a similar fashion to Visio. That's it.
[06:34] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, just a log out
[06:34] <S0me1> Elazar: GIMP
[06:34] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  i see a 'new login' in the menus
[06:34] <Elazar> spikeb: I suppose not. I only really need the graphics.
[06:34] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, where at?
[06:34] <Elazar> S0me1: I was thinking something more specific to GUI design as opposed to just general graphic design.
[06:34] <spikeb> Elazar: i think glade might do what you're after, check it out
[06:34] <jmoncayo> how do i know if java plugin is working in my firefox
[06:35] <Dr_Willis> applicatons/system tools
[06:35] <Dr_Willis> :P
[06:35] <Healot> jmoncayo: if you have a 32bit FF, yes
[06:35] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, yes i see it
[06:35] <Elazar> spikeb: Ah, much closer to what I'm looking for. :) Thanks.
[06:35] <torpedo|dog> jmoncayo, I suggest going to http://processiong.org/ and seeing if it dies or asks for a plugin.
[06:35] <spikeb> Elazar: no problem :)
[06:35] <torpedo|dog> * http://processing.org/
[06:36] <S0me1> jmoncayo: you must download it from JAVA site
[06:36] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, does that run another X ?
[06:36] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, then how do i switch between them
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> alt-ctrl-f7 and F8 normally
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> linux FUNdamentals. :P
[06:36] <Some_Person> can you install GRUB to partitions and have them not auto-boot to GRUB?

[06:37] <jmoncayo> torpedo|dog, it opened the page
[06:37] <voraistos> Apostle^: just wait a week for dapper to be released
[06:37] <cu83> hey all
[06:37] <Apostle^> voraistos, thing is i'm not sure i'm gonna upgrade this pc
[06:37] <Some_Person> can't you just download bootsect.lnx?
[06:37] <torpedo|dog> jmoncayo, does it ask for  a plugin?
[06:37] <cubikdice> Some_Person, sure. thats what GRUB is for..it will enable it self if that partion is run i suppose
[06:37] <intelikey> !dualboot
[06:37] <Apostle^> voraistos, i have dapper on my other one, but it needs a new mother board

[06:38] <jmoncayo> torpedo|dog, nope
[06:38] <voraistos> Apostle^: why not upgrade ?!
[06:38] <CharlesE> Can someone
[06:38] <torpedo|dog> Alright, just try going to one of the demos then.
[06:38] <Apostle^> voraistos, don't want to risk the data on this pc
[06:38] <cu83> I accedentaly edited my terminal to run a command instead of executing the terminal!!! How can i fix this???
[06:38] <cu83> please =)
[06:38] <CharlesE> Can someone help me out my wireless isnt working properly I can ping 192.168.0.1 <-- my router But when i type http://192.168.0.1 i cant get a reponse
[06:38] <torpedo|dog> cu83, as in you changed the shortcut?
[06:38] <voraistos> Apostle^: u could install the nu xorg, and compile the nu gnome.....
[06:38] <Apostle^> voraistos, ahh, no thanks
[06:39] <cu83> no, if u edit the current profile while in the terminal to run a command it will run the command not the terminal
[06:39] <jmoncayo> torpedo|dog, yea it works
[06:39] <cdubya> CharlesE, what kinda setup do you have
[06:39] <torpedo|dog> Well, well done, jmoncayo, you've installed Java! :D
[06:39] <voraistos> Apostle^: i upgraded to the beta version, and it is very safe i think. moreover, if u have another ubuntu box, u can do whatever u want, u can still access directly the data
[06:39] <jmoncayo> so cool
[06:40] <cu83> i thought it ment like run a command before it runs the terminal not instead of the terminal
[06:40] <Apostle^> voraistos, my other pc is down for the count
[06:40] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, does that new login tool start a new X ?
[06:40] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  yes. it should
[06:40] <delmar> Hey everyone. I had been in here many times over the last week or so asking about sound issues, and not being able to run things while other stuff is running and all that crap... and was constantly told it was a big issue with Linux and sound... well im here to mention that my issue is now fixed, and I have lots of stuff mixing sound output all at once and with none of the silly hacks that are mentioned on the forums....I simple di
[06:40] <delmar> sabled the obviously crappy onboard sound, and installed an Audigy2 card.  problem solved.
[06:40] <voraistos> Apostle^: because of upgrade ?
[06:40] <CharlesE> I have a router 192.168.0.1 (wireless) with two other computers I have tried using the ubuntu computer with the LAN and not wireless and it still has the same problem it does not want to do DCHP but you can STILL ping 192.168.0.1 even though it refuses to do a proper dchp
[06:40] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, ahh, see i don't want to lose any pc performance
[06:40] <spikeb> yeah there is now a 64bit ff plugin that doesnt suck so bad
[06:40] <Apostle^> voraistos, no because MB is fried i think
[06:40] <delmar> I would like to add that the on-board sound on the motherboard shouldn't be too crappy.. it wasnt a cheap board.
[06:40] <spikeb> blackdown 64bit is pretty decent i hear
[06:40] <Some_Person> Can I install GRUB to my ext3 partition and make the .lnx file from the live cd?
[06:41] <Dr_Willis> Apostle^,  got some  thinking to do then..  :P
[06:41] <voraistos> Apostle^: lol, ok, i didnt understand that ;)
[06:41] <cu83> gahhhh lol what can i do about my terminal it's not starting =(
[06:41] <Some_Person> then copy the file to a fat16 partition and copy it to my ntfs drive from there?
[06:41] <delmar> anyway... just thought I would mention that it would seem ubuntu/linux is not as forgiving compared to Microsoft, when it comes to lower spec audio hardware, and better audio hardware is needed.
[06:41] <Apostle^> Dr_Willis, well the situation i have now will work i suppose, i just need to try something
[06:41] <CrippsFX> spikeb, well, other than a few difficulties with font rendering, it's not all that bad. all I ever used in Fedora ;)
[06:41] <cdubya> CharlesE, so are you getting a good IP?
[06:42] <Apostle^> delmar, thats a rediculous statement
[06:42] <voraistos> cu 83: Ctrl Alt F1
[06:42] <jacount> does anyone know anything about firestarter? I am trying to bridge my dial up connection over my network and cant get it to work right
[06:42] <intelikey> cu83 hehhe i guess that's one for the "never do this" list... :)    drop to a console and grep the command  then edit the file that contains it.    i.e.   [alt] +[ctrl] +[f1]   (login)  grep -HiRae'that command' ..
[06:42] <spikeb> CrippsFX: cool
[06:43] <CrippsFX> delmar, it's good that you got your problem fixed ... I would have expected that using ALSA, JACK, or esd you *should* have been able to get stuff mixing properly as long as each program was trying to use the sound daemon, and not asking for direct hardware access.
[06:43] <delmar> Apostle^, fine. but it just happened... the onboard hardware on this P5N32-SLI Deluxe board works MINT in windows.. but doesn't in Linux-Ubuntu breezy 5.10. I did nothing but disable the onboard, install an Audigy2, and now I have stuff mixing great... with no software hacks or anything....
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> I got an audigy2 and it works great :P
[06:43] <delmar> CrippsFX, as soon as i started using cedega with alsa, i couldnt play music.. and getting TeamSpeak to work.. forgett it
[06:43] <CharlesE> cduby I dont know all i know is i can ping it, when i tried to install ubuntu it REFUSED to do DCHP with both my lan and wireless (my lan is part of a nforce2 mobo, because its nforce2 it should just work as it used to work just fine)  anyway it wont do dchp BUT I DO GET A VALID PING
[06:43] <Dr_Willis> considering the cheapness of the low end creative cards and how well they work.. $*&#& onboard audio.
[06:44] <CrippsFX> ... but I have no hardware to use it with ;)
=== dracflamloc_ is now known as dracflamloc
[06:44] <delmar> I just started Cedega... Everquest... TeamSpeak... the works... and everything is working perfectly
[06:44] <delmar> all I did was replace the hardware....
[06:44] <cu83> whoa CTRL+ALT+F1
[06:44] <cu83> isn't what i wanted
[06:44] <cu83> lol
[06:44] <delmar> so the hardware is crap.. altho it works fine under windows
[06:44] <CrippsFX> delmar, ahh. gaming stuff.
[06:44] <cu83> thanks tho
[06:44] <cdubya> CharlesE, and when you try to do anything with it in the Networking config, you get nothing......?
[06:44] <disinterested_pe> ok when i open mplayer i get an error about the new_face failed maybe the font path is wrong please supply the text font file (~/mplayer/subfont.ttf) how do i do that?
[06:44] <delmar> CrippsFX, actually no.... try using Audacity and playing music
[06:44] <delmar> CrippsFX, that works now
[06:45] <voraistos> cu83: Ctrl Alt F7
[06:45] <delmar> CrippsFX, gaming stuff.. .which uses ALSA
[06:45] <CrippsFX> delmar, yeah, I'm not sure how windows does their specific mixing stuff, but it's a *bit* different in linux ;)
[06:45] <cu83> I'm talking about in the GUI i can't start the terminal anymore becauses i made echo "Welcome" run instead in the profile proporities now it's executing that instead of the tereminal
[06:45] <jacount> anyone have any experiance with firestarter lol
[06:45] <CrippsFX> delmar, ah yeah, using audacity ... I've had problems with that before :P
[06:45] <intelikey> cu83 i thought you wanted to fix it.....
[06:45] <cu83> how do i fix it from the cmd line?
[06:46] <delmar> CrippsFX, audicity is a bit of a pain since it has no other options but to use /dev/dsp or direct hardware.. rather than being able to output to a sound server type deal
[06:46] <intelikey> cu83 so drop to a console and grep the command  then edit the file that contains it.    i.e.   [alt] +[ctrl] +[f1]   (login)  grep -HiRae'that command' ..
[06:46] <Dr_Willis> cu83,  made it run from where?
[06:46] <CharlesE> cdubya, I would say it has not connected at all however when i go to the network tools thru system->admin->network tools i get a ping I have a feeling that ubuntu wont send the wep properly like its supposed to :( so maybe thats why im not getting on but i did type it correctly and i tried lan also
[06:46] <delmar> Seems that more aplication -> sound mixer support needed in many ways but ... sure does also seem that there is some hardware out there that makes life really simple....
[06:46] <delmar> Audigy2 FTW
[06:46] <voraistos> cu83: u dont need any gui when u have 6 beautiful tty, and the log
[06:47] <CrippsFX> delmar, yeah. It is. and I wish the developers would fix that. At least the option for Jack would be nice.
[06:47] <cu83> k
[06:47] <cu83> lemmie try one sec brb thanks intelikey
[06:47] <intelikey> cu83 then   nano <file.name>    and remove the command you entered.
[06:47] <cdubya> CharlesE, so when you set the eth0 to activate, did it finish it OK, and then you clicked OK?
[06:47] <spikeb> is jack at the same level as oss and alsa?
[06:47] <spikeb> or is it more at the level of artsd and esd
[06:47] <CrippsFX> delmar, yeah, a lot of hardware only allows one output ....
[06:48] <CrippsFX> Spikbebi1, more arts/esd
[06:48] <dereks> can anyone tell me why the "fullscreen" option in tscclient(terminal server client) for vnc doesn't work on dapper?
[06:48] <CrippsFX> ... only "low latency" ;)
[06:48] <spikeb> CrippsFX: i wonder if there's an alsa-jack type deal
[06:48] <spikeb> like there is alsa-oss, etc
[06:48] <CharlesE> inside the operating system it took a long time and showed no error (the device does appear) I entered the correct wep and ssid when i tried the installation of both 5.10 and dapper beta2 it refused to get a dchp thing setup on both lan and wirelss even though it could detect the devices
[06:48] <cu83> i changed the settings from the Gnome
[06:48] <cu83> by starting a terminal
[06:48] <cu83> and then clicking edit current profile
[06:48] <CrippsFX> spikeb, you could set jack to work on startup, but not all programs have output plugins for jack ... although, the jack control (if you download it) isn't too bad for figuring that out.
[06:49] <intelikey> Dr_Willis cu83 has gnome-terminal set to exec a command rather than open a terminal.... so i said to him grep the command and edit the file that has it.     but i'm lagging about 30 seconds, so if you want to take over that one.  be my guest.
[06:49] <spikeb> interesting, CrippsFX
[06:49] <cdubya> CharlesE, can you open a terminal and type ifconfig and then pastebin the output?
[06:49] <voraistos> cu83: what was the problem then ?!
[06:49] <CrippsFX> spikeb, what, me, or what I just said? ;)
[06:49] <cu83> so...
[06:49] <Kholerabbi> is ubuntu shipped with yum?
[06:49] <Dr_Willis> cu83,  you  edited the icon? menu item?
[06:49] <cu83> grep -HiRae 'echo "Welcome"'
[06:49] <CrippsFX> Kholerabbi, nope. it uses apt
[06:49] <Dr_Willis> Kholerabbi,  no.. thats not a debian tool.
[06:49] <CharlesE> cdubya, i can not ping 192.168.0.2 <-- desktop or 192.168.0.3 <-- laptop but i can ping the router, i think ubuntu is having problems getting access to the router the weird thing is i entered all the correct data and i dont know why it would do this to the lan as well as wireless
[06:50] <spikeb> CrippsFX: what you said ;)
[06:50] <CrippsFX> Kholerabbi, yum is an rpm tool ... started by yellowdog linux, and adopted by the larger distros such as RHEL, Fedora, and all the derivative distros.
[06:50] <intelikey> cu83 yes   that
[06:50] <cu83> k
[06:50] <cu83> thanks =P
[06:50] <cu83> brb
[06:51] <cdubya> CharlesE, can you tell me what the output of ifconfig is for eth0...... whether there's an entry for inet.....then an IP number?
[06:51] <Kholerabbi> So, apt, how do you use it?
[06:51] <CharlesE> cdubya, yes i will be a min or 2 though brb
[06:51] <voraistos> apt-get install whatever u want
[06:51] <cu83> k it's searching =P
[06:51] <intelikey> cu83 may need to add .??*   it may be in a .file in your home dir.
[06:51] <CrippsFX> Kholerabbi, try reading "man apt" ... but the basic ones are "apt-get update" "apt-cache search <package>" and "apt-get install <package>"
[06:52] <CrippsFX> wow ... I'm starting to sound like a factoid bot :P
[06:52] <cu83> what would the cmd look like after adding .??*?
[06:52] <cdubya> heh
[06:52] <cu83> i don't use grep very often =P
[06:53] <Kholerabbi> OK, I'm on windows at the moment, and have fedora4, but since I couldn't be bothered getting a new the new fedora, and Ubuntu looks pretty damn nice, I'll just install Ubuntu. Thanks
[06:53] <voraistos> CrippsFX: u mean u are not a bot ? lol
[06:53] <intelikey> grep -HiRae 'echo "Welcome"' .??*
[06:53] <CrippsFX> voraistos, ;)
[06:53] <cu83> thanks =p

[06:54] <CharlesE> cdubya, i think i found the problem although i am not sure. is 192.168.0.1 the default ip for ubuntu to try and use i think its tried to make my computer have the same ip as the router :S

[06:55] <voraistos> yea, but i aint no bot ;)
[06:55] <cu83> it doesn't look like it's going to find it is there anything else i could try?
[06:55] <CharlesE> cdubya, this still does not fix the problem do you know how to get it connecting to the router properly because this is just weird i am entering the correct info and lan does not work also
[06:55] <CharlesE> cbuya, no just let me know why i could ping 192.168.0.1
[06:56] <cu83> nope, it didn't find it intelikey
[06:56] <CrippsFX> hmmm .... I gotta go try something.
[06:56] <cu83> =(
[06:56] <MetaMorfoziS> bye all i go to school :\

[06:57] <mcquaid> hello, weird problem, flash is not working for me in firefox, but works fine in epiphany
[06:58] <cdubya> CharlesE, so you're sure that the router is using WEP and not WPA?
[06:58] <mcquaid> both have the same info for flash in about:plugins
[06:58] <mcquaid> sites in firefox dont' complain about flash missing, it just seems ignored
[06:58] <cdubya> CharlesE, also, do you have the Connection Settings under that properties window set to DHCP?
[06:58] <CharlesE> cdubya, i am using wep on my pda\laptop\this desktop i recently changed back to wep from wpa due to the fact you could only select wep on ubuntu
[06:59] <CharlesE> 100% sure its the right password\and a wep
[06:59] <CrippsFX> 100%  isn't enough ....
[06:59] <CrippsFX> :P
[06:59] <voraistos> CrippsFX !tell mcquaid about plugins
[06:59] <cdubya> CharlesE, so what is the IP you're getting for eth0?
[06:59] <CharlesE> i am going to check if i did it with the right case sensitivity but i doubt it will change anything
[06:59] <CrippsFX> mcquaid, plugins suck. and so doe Damn Slow Linux.
=== poimen is now known as poimen-shower
[07:00] <CrippsFX> uhh ... I mean ....
[07:00] <tangent> how could I repair my gconf schemas if they have become corrupt?
[07:00] <cdubya> intelikey, yep
[07:00] <cdubya> me too
[07:00] <intelikey> :)
[07:01] <CrippsFX> mcquaid, double check the symlink in your firefox plugins folder ... it may not be pointing to the right file ... failing that, check out the preferences of firefox under the "contents" tab, I do bleieve.
[07:02] <cdubya> CharlesE, both of your interfaces are listed in /etc/network/interfaces, correct? (as well as having entries there for dhcp on each interface)
[07:02] <gabo> hi, can anyone help me please?
[07:02] <CrippsFX> gabo, not if you don't give us any information.

[07:03] <gabo> ok, i was trying to configure my keyboard
[07:03] <jacount> can someone help me in setting up this bridge?
[07:03] <gabo> and i could not do so
[07:03] <cdubya> CharlesE, might read up on what I asked there.....what's your /etc/network/interfaces file report about eth0 and your wireless interface?
[07:04] <intelikey> cu83 hmmm checked with welcome i supose
[07:04] <intelikey> CrippsFX yeah
[07:04] <gabo> i choose the language i want and it doesnt really change

[07:07] <intelikey>           john - active password cracking tool
[07:07] <Corey> guys..im unable to delete stuff of my usb hardrive it says im not allowed to how can I fix that ?
[07:07] <cdubya> gabo, so you added the layout you wanted?
[07:07] <gabo> yeah
[07:07] <gabo> even with the photo
[07:07] <Corey> says i dont have the priveleges..but im a root
[07:08] <CharlesE> cdubya, so what in this file do i need to tell you about?
[07:08] <Corey> never mind i had as not able to write
[07:08] <cdubya> CharlesE, got a line about ath0 or eth0......should say something like iface ath0 inet dhcp
[07:08] <cu83> intelikey do u know what folder it would be in by any chance?
[07:09] <intelikey> Corey ro
[07:09] <intelikey> heheh yeah
[07:09] <cdubya> CharlesE, eth0 line should be similar
[07:09] <cdubya> CharlesE, if you have an ath0 line, should have a couple of lines after it about the ssid and such
[07:09] <cu83> what is it? +P
[07:09] <CharlesE> cdubya, it has the right ssid\password (dont knwo why the pass is not encrypted) but it says auto ath0 and auto eth0 above that it has ifrace lo inet loopback ifrace eth0 inet dhcp (when i rebooted i changed the default to eth0 so thats why thats there)
[07:10] <disinterested_pe> how do i get wma codecs for realplayer
[07:10] <cdubya> CharlesE, k. So eth0 is active right now and plugged into the router?
[07:11] <intelikey> cu83 no.  that's why i had you searching for it...  either  ~  which is your home  as a .file (naturally hidden)  or  .gnome2/some/place/maybe
[07:11] <intelikey> cu83 i don't use gh'nomey so i can't even help you search.
[07:12] <cdubya> cu83, Places > Search for Files
[07:12] <CrippsFX> alright ... time for me to go ... I have to finish getting ready for work.
[07:12] <CrippsFX> ciao.
[07:13] <CharlesE> cdubya, i am so stupid lol the cord went to the router but was not plugged in, but that does not fix the wirelss problem :( lol i am such an idiot though
[07:13] <cdubya> CharlesE, it's no problem.
[07:13] <cdubya> CharlesE, so let's work on the wireless.....
[07:13] <intelikey> cdubya what file is the settings for the gnome-terminal  in ?
[07:13] <CharlesE> cdubya, i still dont have lan working i will try rebooting lan first wireless second
[07:14] <hahaha> hello?
[07:14] <cdubya> intelikey, ~ gconf/apps/gnome-terminal    ? that it?
[07:14] <hahaha> hello?
[07:14] <cdubya> that should have been .gconf....sorry
[07:14] <cdubya> CharlesE, shouldn't have to reboot
[07:15] <cdubya> CharlesE, open the Networking config in System > Administration > Networking
[07:15] <intelikey> cdubya cu83 has locked his self out of his gnome-terminal
[07:15] <cdubya> intelikey, ouch
[07:15] <intelikey> cdubya that sounds good.  but i don't use gnome.
[07:15] <CharlesE> cdubya, i tried that and it wasnt working so i thought id make sure with a reboot
[07:16] <CharlesE> cdubya, i can now use lan
[07:16] <CharlesE> will the updates to ubuntu fix this do u think?
[07:17] <cdubya> CharlesE, kewl
[07:17] <cu83> i can't believe i locked myself out lol
[07:17] <intelikey> cu83 see the sujestion cdubya made as to address.   ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal  <--- maybe.
[07:17] <cdubya> CharlesE, so did your wireless work?
[07:17] <cu83> oh, didn't see that thanks lemmie check =)
[07:17] <Pyru> Hello , can anyone help me install support for mp3s, i cannot seem to play or burn them
[07:17] <CharlesE> nope, for some reason that just wont work although the problem is clearly software (even though the driver obviously works)
[07:18] <CharlesE> cdubya, is there a more recent distro to the beta2
[07:18] <cdubya> intelikey, there is another file there....~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default  <---- perhaps this is the modded file when he did the edit current profile?
[07:18] <blackocellaris> Pyru, i'm having the same problems with playing them.  But when I installed xmms I was able to start playing them :X
[07:19] <cdubya> hey tonyyarusso.
[07:19] <blackocellaris> give that a shot if you havent, outside of that I cant be of any help sorry :'(
[07:19] <Pyru> blackocellaris, this is my 2nd day with ubuntu im very new to it all
[07:19] <Pyru> dont know what xmms is
[07:19] <cu83> found the file and edited it =P but ekkk terminal just closesed I think i have it tho =)
[07:19] <cdubya> CharlesE, are you getting a good IP for ath0?
[07:19] <blackocellaris> xmms is like "winamp"=/  I'm new to ubuntu also :)
[07:19] <VR_> Pyru: xmms is like the winamp for linux
[07:19] <tonyyarusso> cdubya: Hey.
[07:20] <blackocellaris> Go into your terminal and type "sudo apt-get install xmms" and that should install xmms
[07:20] <cdubya> tonyyarusso, out for the summer?
[07:20] <blargh> hello.. I have the wonderful broadcom wifi adapter in my notebook.. does anyone have a link or can give me some directions to get it working.. that DOES NOT include using the internet?
[07:20] <CharlesE> cdubya, yeah im on google all is good. is there a more recent version of ubuntu then beta 2 if there is i should really do a dist-upgrade before trying to fix it i think
[07:20] <VR_> Pyru: you need the codecs to be able to play mp3s.
[07:20] <blackocellaris> Hopefully that'll fix the playback problem :X
[07:20] <Pyru> VR_, how do i install them?
[07:20] <VR_> !tell Pyru about restricted
[07:20] <tonyyarusso> cdubya: Yeah.  And back at home on dialup.
[07:20] <cdubya> tonyyarusso, my apologies.....:/
[07:20] <VR_> Pyru: go to that page that ubotu gave you.
[07:21] <cdubya> tonyyarusso, that hurts. :(
[07:21] <VR_> Pyru: read carefully, and you'll have no problems.
[07:21] <tonyyarusso> CharlesE: There's a flight 7 and sometime in the next few hours a release candidate is due if it's not out already.
[07:21] <intelikey> cu83 if need be you can rm the file.... you only loose the customization of your term.  you can re-do that...

[07:23] <cdubya> !restricted
[07:23] <ubotu> restricted is, like, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats  Most of the formats listed there can be replaced by !FreeFormats
[07:23] <tonyyarusso> CharlesE: I would guess the archive.ubuntu.com one without a country code.  But it might get swamped, and the other official ones will be on it pretty quick.

[07:30] <FliesLikeALap> disinterested_pe  any reason you're not just using gaim?
[07:31] <cdubya> blargh, I've been fortunate to have it picked up on all the installs I've done without installing any drivers......so it was cake
[07:31] <cu83> hehehe
[07:31] <disinterested_pe> i am useing gaim but was trying to get the features of yahoo
[07:31] <blargh> cdubya: i should point out I have wifi working in windows.. so if i need to download something.. i can.. just not while in ubuntu

[07:32] <cdubya> heh
[07:32] <disinterested_pe> u mean it used to be ymessenger?
[07:32] <FliesLikeALap> cdubya  it sounds like he doesn't have it installed yet

[07:33] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, I use it with msn, aim, yahoo and freenode......heh
[07:33] <intelikey> blargh haven't been keeping up, what's the issue ?
[07:34] <FliesLikeALap> jacount what bridge?
[07:34] <spikeb> you use gaim for irc?
[07:34] <spikeb> eew
[07:34] <cdubya> heh
[07:34] <intelikey> bx man bx
[07:34] <blargh> intelikey: i have a hp laptop with the 'lovely' broadcom wifi builtin.. I need a way to install the drivers that doesnt make use of internet acccess while in ubuntu (so like no apt-get's)
[07:34] <FliesLikeALap> disinterested_pe is there a reason you don't want to use gaim for your yahoo account?
[07:35] <cdubya> well, that way I don't have to have several apps open spikeb......:)
[07:35] <jacount> FliesLikeALap: I am trying to bridge my dial up connection over my ethernet network with firestarter
[07:35] <spikeb> cdubya: hehe
[07:35] <B_166-ER-X> what the name 'Hd**' of the Master secondary Hd ?
[07:35] <cdubya> spikeb, and I find it actually suits my needs well.....my needs for irc tend to be pretty basic, so it works. :)
[07:35] <B_166-ER-X> what's
[07:36] <blargh> intelikey: I can download stuff if need be in windows and copy it over to my linux partition.. just no inet access while in ubuntu for the time being.. until i get wifi up
[07:36] <spikeb> cdubya: well then that's good :)
[07:36] <FliesLikeALap> sorry jacount I'm not familiar with firestarter.  if all else fails you could look into doing it with iptables
[07:36] <intelikey> blargh the alternative to apt-get is dl what ever to some place accessable then dpkg -i file    but as to wifi   and networking in general. you are out of my forte'  sorry.
[07:36] <kholerabbi> Hey, I am using ubuntu live, to get a feel, but I won't to update Firefox: what's the easiest way? And can it be done on live cd?
[07:37] <B_166-ER-X> hda2 or hdb1 ? (Master secondary)
[07:37] <blargh> intelikey: oh ok.. thanks anyways then :c)
[07:37] <cdubya> blargh, so does the card need ndiswrapper.....?
[07:37] <intelikey> np
[07:37] <blargh> cdubya: i dunno.. the card needs something.. lol
[07:37] <cdubya> heh
[07:37] <blargh> cdubya: ubuntu doesnt detect it on ifconfig
[07:37] <jacount> FliesLikeALap: how do i use that? I just need to get 2 other computers on my network connected to the internet
[07:37] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi you'd be better off just using the version of firefox on the cd, but if you wanted to update it, open a terminal and do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox "
[07:37] <intelikey> !tell blargh about wifi
[07:37] <cdubya> blargh, and it's not in /etc/network/interfaces?
[07:38] <bsdfox> hmm , can anyone help be set DFP-0 as my primary display (:0.0) and CRT-1 as my secondary display (:0.1)... I just got this multimonitor thing working but it won't run gdm on the DFP! my xorg.conf is at http://pastebin.com/736384
[07:38] <intelikey> that wiki might help blargh,   maybe.
[07:38] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi or get the ubuntu dapper live cd.  it is a beta version of ubuntu about to be released, and it will have much newer versions of things like firefox
[07:38] <FliesLikeALap> jacount one minute, let me get a link.
[07:38] <help> good bye
[07:38] <jacount> FliesLikeALap: alright, thank you
[07:39] <blargh> cdubya: been there looked at that.. :c/
[07:39] <FliesLikeALap> jacount I only reccomend this if you've got a decent sense of networking and are familiar with the general differences between distrobutions if you follow these instructions: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/home-router-howto.xml
[07:39] <cdubya> kewl, konqy
[07:39] <blargh> cdubya: but thanks for suggesting it
[07:39] <cdubya> blargh, np....wish I could help more
[07:39] <cdubya> intelikey, did you have troubles with firefox?
[07:39] <FliesLikeALap> jacount just use common sense to tell what is going to be different in ubuntu from gentoo.  if you take the time to understand how iptables works, it will be a very powerful tool for you
[07:39] <jacount> FliesLikeALap: Not really, I know im using ubuntu on the computer with the modem and one of the other ones, the other is running irix
[07:40] <spikeb> konqueror is the easiest browser to use plugins for it seems
[07:40] <FliesLikeALap> jacount all that matters is on the ubuntu box
[07:40] <spikeb> it doesnt need a java plugin, etc
[07:40] <kholerabbi> COuld someone tell me how to update firefox to the newest version on ubuntu live cd please?
[07:40] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi or get the ubuntu dapper live cd.  it is a beta version of ubuntu about to be released, and it will have much newer versions of things like firefox
[07:40] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi you'd be better off just using the version of firefox on the cd, but if you wanted to update it, open a terminal and do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox "
[07:40] <cdubya> intelikey, I'd use konqueror all the time if it would allow me to view several sites that my wife frequents.... :-/
[07:40] <cdubya> heh
[07:40] <jacount> FliesLikeALap: Okay, ill take a look
[07:40] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi  read those two messages, but switch the order I just sent them in
[07:40] <intelikey> cdubya no.  just don't care for it.  and i don't use gnome.   cli mostly  but the gui i use is blackbox with kicker    so konq is handy, why not use it.
[07:40] <spikeb> i'd use konqueror fulltime if it was a gnome app
[07:40] <Hexidigital_> tonight... let us tremble these walls of earth, steel, and stone....
[07:40] <nicko> mm
[07:41] <blargh> actually
[07:41] <FliesLikeALap> I was about to give up on firefox before 1.5.0.1 was released, now I enjoy it much more.
[07:41] <cu83> yay i got it =D
[07:41] <blargh> theres a link there i didnt try.. it might help..
[07:41] <cu83> thanks intelikey
[07:41] <cu83> =D
[07:41] <intelikey> cu83 np.  sorry we missed the first swing.
[07:41] <cu83> tured out once i rm'ed the config files i justs needed to relogin
[07:41] <kholerabbi> OK, thanks, I will order the new cds, but that could take a month..
[07:41] <cu83> =P
[07:41] <Pyru> anyone any good with apache and ubuntu, i need some help please!
[07:41] <cu83> thanks alot =)
[07:41] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi  why not download and burn one?  the new dapper cds are not availble for order yet
[07:42] <cu83> doese anyone know how i can play dvd's totem isn't working right =(
[07:42] <cdubya> 1.5 hangs as much for me as the previous versions, so I gave it up.....even after fiddling with flash and java......thing is, epiphany doesn't have any of those issues hanging and flash works fine in it.......as well as java.
[07:42] <FliesLikeALap> !tell Pyru about ask
[07:42] <FliesLikeALap> cdubya are you on dapper?
[07:42] <intelikey> cu83 i like vlc   some dont.
[07:42] <cdubya> FliesLikeAlap, breezy
[07:42] <spikeb> !tell cdubya about dvd
[07:42] <intelikey> !vlc
[07:42] <ubotu> vlc is probably a video/audio player that supports almost everything - See http://www.videolan.org/ for more information (VLC is in the universe repository)
[07:42] <cdubya> Pyru, what are you trying to do?
[07:43] <FliesLikeALap> cdubya 1.5.0.3 on dapper from the dapper repos has yet to crash.  I had slight stability issues with 1.5.0.2 on dapper until I started using the 1.5.0.3 from the repos
[07:43] <cdubya> heh, thanks spikeb, but I use totem to watch dvds :)
[07:43] <FliesLikeALap> cdubya if you plan on using dapper, I suggest giving firefox another try ;)
[07:43] <Pyru> cdubya, I have apache and php and mysql all installed, i am trying to get my server to have like management over bw/space usage, vhosts so i can host multiple domains if anyone can help me get this setup I am willing to pay via paypal
[07:43] <spikeb> cdubya: that link should let you do that
[07:43] <spikeb> cdubya: try !restrictedformats
[07:44] <FliesLikeALap> I've got flash, java, and the vlc plugin all working in firefox cdubya  ;)
[07:44] <cu83> vlc is a dvd player right?
[07:44] <FliesLikeALap> cu83 it does lots of media
[07:44] <FliesLikeALap> !tell cu83 about vlc
[07:44] <intelikey> cu83 do this  /msg ubotu vlc
[07:44] <cdubya> spikeb, ah....gotcha, yeah, gave that all a shot before. multiple times.....no dice. gave up on it and have no desire to spend hours on end to use Firefox. it's good, but not that good.
[07:45] <cdubya> Pyru, I may be able to help you a bit
[07:45] <B_166-ER-X> why does when i burn a dvd-r,  'normally'  the dvd is unreadable, but IF I 'simulate' it, (then k3b says i cannot do this with dvd-r, i say 'continue and burn normally') THEN it works... anyone have a clue ?
[07:45] <FliesLikeALap> Pyru apache vhosts are not hard to figure out, there are many examples available online.  as for managing users/quotas/other stuff, perhaps look into something like cpanel/plesk perhaps, if you're not equipped to automate all of that on your own
[07:45] <FliesLikeALap> Pyru if all you want is vhosts, that isn't hard to figure out
[07:45] <H080J03> where can i download the latest stable drapper drake?
[07:45] <FliesLikeALap> !dapper
[07:45] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
[07:45] <Pyru> FliesLikeABrick, it's only my second day on linux so im kinda lost as it is hehe
[07:45] <cdubya> Pyru, yeah, what FliesLikeAlap said. :)
[07:45] <spikeb> there is no stable dapper heh
[07:45] <cdubya> Pyru, k
[07:46] <FliesLikeALap> spikeb not true.  it is pretty much stable considering it is going to be released in 6 days
[07:46] <FliesLikeALap> spikeb I've been using dapper for months without any major issues, no problems lately
[07:46] <intelikey> FliesLikeALap excuse me
[07:46] <FliesLikeALap> yes intelikey ?
[07:46] <cu83> what's the universe repository
[07:46] <spikeb> FliesLikeALap: that doesn't make it stable - breezy is stable, not dapper :P\
[07:46] <cu83> like the link or whatever =P
[07:47] <intelikey> just because it is pre-release, it is by definition "un-stable" or beta.
[07:47] <FliesLikeALap> yeah, fair enough
[07:47] <intelikey> that doesn't mean it will crash.

[07:48] <FliesLikeALap> Ademan the vga=xxx lines are used to specify the abilities of your video card that you want used at boot time: screen resolution, color depth, image abilities
[07:49] <FliesLikeALap> that line has no effect on the performance of your system once it is booted though Ademan

[07:49] <Ademan> FliesLikeALap: so it doesnt affect ANYTHING once you start up X?
[07:49] <Ademan> ok
[07:49] <FliesLikeALap> correct Ademan
[07:49] <Ademan> thanks
[07:49] <kholerabbi> Hey, I tried "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox " But only got the next Firefox release (1.0.7 - 1.0.8), How do I get the LATest??
[07:49] <kholerabbi> Latest being (1.5.0.3)
[07:49] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi  to use a later version in a livecd you should use a dapper livecd or install it from a binary tarball from www.getfirefox.com
[07:49] <Ademan> and while we're at it, in /boot/grub/menu.lst   where do you specify "global" options?
[07:50] <FliesLikeALap> Ademan you mean boot options used for all kernels?
[07:50] <Ademan> yep
[07:50] <intelikey> kholerabbi from the mozilla site i guess.
[07:50] <intelikey> !ff1.5
[07:50] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[07:50] <intelikey> kholerabbi ^
=== _deeproot_ is now known as [aha] 
[07:51] <FliesLikeALap> Ademan make a line # kopt = <options here> before your kernel list
[07:51] <FliesLikeALap> Ademan if you install grub from apt or are modifying grub that came with ubuntu, that line already exists and you jut need to modify what is there already
[07:51] <FliesLikeALap> just*
[07:51] <Ademan> FliesLikeALap: and if a line like that already exists? can there be more than one line like that? or just add to that?
[07:51] <Ademan> ah hehe
[07:51] <kholerabbi> OK, but if had ubuntu installed on the hdd, not a livecd, I could use command in the terminal to update to the latest version of firefox?
[07:51] <Ademan> thanks
[07:52] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi if you were in breezy or dapper?
[07:52] <Ademan> i still gotta figure out why my laptop won't power down now
[07:53] <CharlesE> does anyoine here use a good VNC client I want to use remote desktop on linux (a server i am going to setup) and i need a good win32 client at the moment you have to be logged into a user to vnc connect is there a way around this
[07:53] <Pyru> FliesLikeABrick, any free host management program you know of like cpanel but free for linux?
[07:53] <FliesLikeALap> Pyru I knew of one but can't remember it now and it is bothering me quite a bit ;)
[07:53] <intelikey> kholerabbi in dapper current is  "Version: 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-0ubuntu3
[07:53] <intelikey> "
[07:53] <FliesLikeALap> kholerabbi in breezy, firefox needs to be installed following the instructions in the message you're about to get from ubotu, or install the binaries from www.getfirefox.com.  on dapper, you will automatically have 1.5.0.3
[07:53] <FliesLikeALap> !tell kholerabbi about ff1.5
=== _deeproot_ is now known as ^aha^
[07:54] <Pyru> FliesLikeABrick, you better not be thinking of webmin
[07:54] <intelikey> kholerabbi dapper will be released in june.  if all goes as planed.
[07:54] <Pyru> lol
[07:54] <FliesLikeALap> no Pyru I am not
[07:54] <FliesLikeALap> CharlesE are you asking for a win32 vnc client or a client for linux?
[07:54] <FliesLikeALap> CharlesE in win32 the RealVNC viewer client is fine.  In ubuntu you can get a client by doing "sudo apt-get install vncviewer"
[07:54] <CharlesE> FliesLikeALap a client for win32 to connect to ubuntu
[07:55] <FliesLikeALap> CharlesE as long as you're using VNC, all VNC clients should be able to connect to any VNC server as long as you're not doing something weird
[07:55] <jojoman02> if i wanted to track where an ip address from aol came from where would i go (i tried who, it points to VA, i don't think that is correct)
[07:55] <CharlesE> well i am connected now but its rather slow
[07:55] <Pyru> hmmm wonder what i could use... hmmm
[07:55] <jojoman02> whois*
[07:55] <FliesLikeALap> jojoman02 www.dnsstuff.com has a tool that will give you as much information as possible
[07:55] <CharlesE> but if i log out of my user and try to connect to it it wont let me on because the vnc client only lets you enter a password (not a user)
[07:56] <FliesLikeALap> CharlesE are you trying to set up VNC or X forwarding?
[07:56] <intelikey> CharlesE ssh ?
[07:56] <CharlesE> i dont know what xforwarding is
[07:56] <FliesLikeALap> CharlesE perhaps because the vnc server is being stopped when you log out?
[07:57] <jojoman02> FliesLikeALap, doesn't aol have it's own whois?
[07:57] <Pyru> FliesLikeABrick,  see if you can see if any of these ring a bell http://www.web-hosting-top.com/web-hosting/directory.control-panels
[07:57] <FliesLikeALap> jojoman02 whois will not give you the location of an IP, it will give you the location of the business that owns it
[07:57] <CharlesE> intelikey I know what ssh is i want both ssh as well as a remote desktop I use remote desktop all the time with windows and just want to have the same kind of experiance but with linux
[07:57] <jojoman02> FliesLikeALap, i know but generally you can get the city if the business has a regional whois server setup
[07:57] <intelikey> xforwarding
[07:58] <jojoman02> FliesLikeALap, i mean state:p
[07:58] <intelikey> !X
[07:58] <ubotu> somebody said x was a portable, network-transparent window system.
[07:58] <disinterested_pe> hi jojoman02
[07:58] <jojoman02> hey dis
[07:58] <disinterested_pe> ive got an issue
[07:58] <CharlesE> whats xforwarding
[07:58] <cdubya> Pyru, ISPConfig is the one I read about recently, but haven't used it.....
[07:58] <basic`> hi, my friend wants to install ubuntu x64 on his laptop, and it's giving us an error on the install, after partitioning his hard disk
[07:59] <jojoman02> disinterested_pe, tell me
[07:59] <FliesLikeALap> Pyru ispconfig is the one I think I was thinking of
[07:59] <disinterested_pe> im trying to install the yahoo messenger i get the files open in terminal then get stuck do u know anything to do
=== efpc2003_ is now known as efpc2003
[08:00] <FliesLikeALap> disinterested_pe is there an install or readme file included amongst them, or installation instructions where you got it from?
[08:00] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, so you unpacked the files.....have you run the executable?
[08:00] <basic`> its failing at installing the base system
[08:00] <cu83> aww vlc is not installing
[08:00] <disinterested_pe> ive got generic instructions
[08:00] <cu83> i added every universe repository
[08:00] <cu83> and  click vlc and  install
[08:00] <intelikey> CharlesE you need someone that at least uses vnc to help you.  but X forwarding is putting the X window on a remote box via something like 'vnc or tightVNC'
[08:01] <cu83> and it had required packages
[08:01] <disinterested_pe> no i havent yet cdubya
[08:01] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, so what have you done?
[08:01] <cu83> that i can't seem to install without installing the packages that require it to be installed =(
[08:01] <basic`> it says something about debootstrap
[08:01] <basic`> is anyone listening to me
[08:01] <intelikey> cu83 yes... and synaptic didn't fetch the dependancies ?
[08:02] <disinterested_pe> ive gotten to the next cmd after getting all the files from desktop
[08:02] <intelikey> cu83 sudo apt-get install vlc
[08:02] <CharlesE> intelikey i have tightvnc working now.... the problem is its like 20 times slower then the windows equivilent :( oh well
[08:03] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, just out of curiosity, which version of messenger did you download?
[08:03] <Hexidigital_> can someone tell me what i forgot to do on my host machine to allow ssh connections?
[08:03] <intelikey> hehhe i first read that as "20 minutes slower"  hehhe
[08:04] <cu83> didn't work =(
[08:04] <cdubya> Hexidigital_, start ssh? create user accounts?........
[08:04] <cu83> can i post the error here?
[08:04] <kholerabbi> OK, thanks, I have ordered a few ubuntu dapper cds.
[08:04] <intelikey> CharlesE like i said you need someone that at least knows something about it, to help you out there.
[08:04] <Pyru> ispconfig free?

=== ubuntu is now known as x-wey
[08:05] <cu83> a bunch of packages are required
[08:05] <cu83> =)
[08:05] <disinterested_pe> what is it
[08:05] <intelikey> and the error is ?
[08:05] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, you downloaded the file from the link on the bottom of the download page, yeah?
[08:05] <cu83> ummm...
[08:05] <disinterested_pe> yep
[08:05] <cu83> The following packages have unmet dependencies:

[08:07] <cdubya> disinterested_pe, do you not want to use gaim, or is there something about ymessenger that you really need.
[08:07] <cu83> that was asposed to be one line
[08:07] <cu83> sorry all

[08:07] <intelikey> ok. i see it.
[08:07] <disinterested_pe> i just wanted the features of ymessenger

[08:19] <Healot> many regional-chat rooms are not active... so i guess this is the best chan to ask question... imho
[08:19] <spikeb> Healot: yes it is, if you can understand english
[08:20] <spikeb> Healot: and speak it passably
[08:20] <ubuntu> nobody is talking in ubuntu.tr :(
[08:21] <spikeb> ubuntu can you read and type english ?
[08:21] <Madpilot> ubuntu, try #ubuntu-tr instead of .tr
[08:21] <ubuntu> is there another one ?
[08:21] <rajeev> crimsun,hav u got my pastebin
[08:21] <Healot> yes, i would like to express that spikeb
[08:21] <crimsun> rajeev: what's the url?
[08:21] <defrysk> ubuntu your question is turjish related and there is not much hope for you finding an answer here :(
[08:22] <defrysk> ubuntu there is also a turkish debian chanel
[08:22] <Madpilot> ubuntu, were you in #ubuntu-tr or #ubuntu.tr? The real Turkish channel is #ubuntu-tr
[08:22] <spikeb> Madpilot: no it isn't
[08:23] <spikeb>  Topic for #ubuntu-tr is please go to #ubuntu.tr --- ltfen #ubuntu.tr e gidin www.ubuntu-tr.com
[08:23] <defrysk> Madpilot, there is no ubuntu-tr
[08:23] <Madpilot> spikeb, ah, my mistake - all the other international channels use -CC instead of .CC
[08:23] <Madpilot> sorry
[08:23] <spikeb> Madpilot: i know, it's strange
[08:23] <rajeev> crimsun,i don't know url"my pastbin is  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14615"
[08:23] <defrysk> ubuntu try #debian.tr maybe someone can help you there
[08:25] <ubuntu> thank u  guys
[08:25] <defrysk> and ubuntu, there is also #turklug
[08:25] <spikeb> ubuntu you are welcome
[08:25] <defrysk> the topic there is about turkish and utf8

[08:26] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, B1zz
[08:26] <rajeev> crimsun,r u there?
[08:26] <crimsun> rajeev: try telling vlc/gxine to use 5.1
[08:27] <Ademan> synaptic keeps giving me crap about this:
[08:27] <Ademan> packages.c: 191 proccesses queue
[08:27] <Ademan> so somethign on line 191 in packages.c
[08:27] <Ademan> i dunno whats wrong with it though
[08:28] <Ademan> interestingly enough though it says the packages dont install, they seem to work fine
[08:30] <rajeev> crimsun,it say bash: vlc/gxine: No such file or directory
[08:30] <crimsun> rajeev: whatever app you use.
[08:31] <Healot> hehe
[08:31] <Healot> he typed "vlc/gxine" at once
[08:31] <alexander_> hallo, how do i get the mail command into ubuntu
[08:31] <spikeb> you can use evolution for that alexander_
[08:32] <alexander_> spike: not the app. just the command for a script
[08:32] <zcat[1] > apt-get install postfix  will probably do it..
[08:33] <zcat[1] > does postfix include a 'mail' command?
[08:33] <alexander_> zcat: is there a way to install postfix without smtp server (already James running)
[08:33] <spikeb> oh
[08:34] <rajeev> crimsun,i didn't under..
[08:34] <crimsun> rajeev: it some apps, you have to switch speaker configurations manually.
[08:35] <zcat[1] > if you already have an smtp server, it likely has a mail command or something similar (postfix has a sendmail command to send mail..)
[08:36] <Healot> the name explains itself :)
[08:38] <alexander_> i just found: nail - feature-rich BSD mail(1). this does the job
[08:38] <alexander_> thanks anyway
[08:38] <spikeb> cool alexander_
[08:39] <bur[n] er> Pyru: still around?
[08:39] <Pyru> bur[n] er, I am

[08:40] <bur[n] er> oh, hey
[08:40] <Healot> keep your windows server really
[08:40] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: i'm running out of things that require windows (no linux support)
[08:40] <Healot> because linux/windows connectivity rocks :)
[08:40] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: that is always a good thing to hear
[08:40] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: i have no need for windows anymore (besides a win2000 machine that runs my printer)
[08:41] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: i should add, it's a vmware machine, not a physical machine
[08:41] <rajeev> crimsun.plz can u tell me where to config.. in apps
[08:41] <Healot> nah, I keep both, there's no need to waste any OS :)
[08:42] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: you ever been through a MCSE bootcamp?
[08:42] <B1zz> 0_o
[08:42] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: than you have NO idea how much i DESPISE windows  :)
[08:42] <Healot> I am in one now.... hehe
[08:42] <Hexidigital_> ugh
[08:42] <Hexidigital_> horrible
[08:43] <Healot> Windows rocks... but MSCE exam questions are confusing

[08:43] <Hexidigital_> yes, they are

[08:43] <Hexidigital_> hiya DBO
[08:43] <brn> Hey ompaul...
[08:43] <Healot> freaking s that MS did
[08:44] <ompaul> Healot, your offtopic
[08:44] <Hexidigital_> ompaul:: it was my fault
[08:44] <ompaul> talk about LPI and the joys of lsmod :-)
=== slackern is now known as slackern|off
=== slackern|off is now known as slackern
[08:44] <zcat[1] > LPI?
[08:44] <DBO> LPI need to become more widely spread, its not recognized well enough
[08:44] <ompaul> Linux Professional Institure
[08:44] <zcat[1] > ahhh...
[08:45] <ompaul> Institute even
[08:45] <ompaul> It should be called know your linux :-)
[08:45] <DBO> KNY was already taken by a state that sells good chicken
[08:45] <Hexidigital_> LPI = RTFM, imo
[08:45] <DBO> wait...
[08:45] <Hexidigital_> too many acronyms
[08:46] <B1zz> lol
[08:46] <petrik> Does TFM have anything about getting a webcam working?
[08:46] <spikeb> !webcam
[08:46] <ubotu> from memory, webcam is now easy to install, per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Webcam - webcam support soon to be available in  gaim-vv. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[08:46] <DBO> yes, yes it does =P
[08:46] <ompaul> Hexidigital,  no, it is a set of exams that do test your Linux knowledge, RTFM is an attitude of mind in a lot of other #irc-channels
[08:47] <ompaul> btw for the purposes of this channel f=fine
[08:47] <basic`> can someone link me to a good dual boot win xp / ubuntu guide?
[08:47] <Hexidigital_> ompaul:: i know, i was being facisous(sp).... i'm studying for the LPI btw
[08:47] <ompaul> !dualboot

[08:48] <ompaul> Hexidigital, I must write to my friends to put in some harder questions for you
[08:48] <brn> QUESTION:  What is delaying "Breezy Badger"?  What improvements are seen?
[08:48] <Hexidigital_> ompaul:: since you have friends in that industry, any idea where i can find some study guides?
[08:48] <petrik> Camera freezes system. Have found some info about spca5???? but getting errors trying to compile
[08:49] <Healot> DAPPER isthe one delayed, brandon_
[08:49] <Healot> brn
[08:49] <DBO> Hexidigital, there is an exam cram LPI book
[08:49] <petrik> This is all new to me so bear with me
[08:49] <Ademan> zcat[1] : is this line in menu.lst correct?
[08:49] <petrik> Decided to finally get rid of M$
[08:49] <B1zz> how much is this exam running you? i would like to take itv:)
[08:49] <B1zz> or at least try to take it :-p
[08:49] <DBO> Blzz its around 100 iirc
[08:49] <ompaul> brn, breezy badger is released 5.10 - dapper was delayed and the reasons are all on the wiki but it comes down to this, 3 billion extra potential users, as the o/s needed a lot more translation work
[08:50] <basic`> thanks ubotu
[08:50] <endless_us> need help for right way of setting up IRTrans & lcdproc. PLEASE!!!
[08:50] <Hexidigital_> DBO:: you have a website? my local bookstore does not have stuff like that

[08:50] <ubotu> Yep, that's me! I'm a bot alright. Read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbotuUsage to find out how to use me. Do NOT play with me in any channel except #debian-bots.
[08:50] <brn> ...Opps!... I think I meant Dapper Drake.  (I hate cute names)
[08:50] <Hexidigital_> congrats petrik
[08:50] <Ademan> # kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=792 acpi=force
[08:51] <DBO> petrik, welcome to a bigger world =)  Hexidigital, no i dont, but a googling would help you...
[08:51] <Hexidigital_> tyaw, DBO
[08:52] <spikeb> if you hate cute names, then learn the release numbers
[08:53] <petrik> Well I have dabbled (like a few hours at a time) in the past with Red Hat and Mandrake. This time I got live CDs of Ark, Mandriva, Knoppix and settled on Ubuntu
[08:54] <brn> spikeb:  Thanks.  Release numbers are more like my native language.  Easy to remember and sequential too.
[08:54] <Hexidigital_> settled??
[08:54] <spikeb> brn: :)
[08:54] <Hexidigital_> you have endured....
[08:54] <rajeev> crimsun,plz reply sir
[08:54] <GNAM> today candidate day
[08:54] <Healot> btw Ubuntu ranks first (distrowatch)
[08:55] <Hexidigital_> gnam, really??
[08:55] <spikeb> has for a while Healot
[08:55] <GNAM> yes
[08:55] <Hexidigital_> sweet
[08:55] <Healot> yup
[08:55] <GNAM> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseSchedule
[08:56] <ompaul> Healot, it would be for about a year and a half at the top now if I recall correctly. :-) I think It got there around December 2004 and has not gone away since
[08:57] <ompaul> Healot, I now note my brain and the calender are not in sync
[08:57] <Healot> hehe
[08:58] <spikeb> haha
[08:58] <petrik> It's talking nicely with my printer hooked up to another PC (XP for now but not much longer) on my 2 PC network. Hope to be able to run the couple of M$ reliant programs I need through WINE
[08:58] <Healot> the fact is ubuntu still lead, and I am going to keep it by helping more new users
[08:59] <Hexidigital_> should i be worried about upgrading to edgy eft breaking my bcm43xx setup?
[08:59] <Hexidigital_> (on dapper now)
[08:59] <disinterested_pe> breezy doesnt use red hat does it?
[09:00] <Healot> disinterested_pe: it has the debian base
[09:00] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: yes
[09:00] <Ademan> # kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro vga=792 acpi=force
[09:00] <disinterested_pe> ok
[09:00] <Ademan> is that a valid line in menu.lst?
[09:00] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: .... was worried about that...
[09:00] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: upgrading to edgy anytime soon is going to break a LOT :P
[09:00] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: do you suggest i remain on dapper for a while?
[09:01] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: certainly :)
[09:01] <Hexidigital_> (i just got my wireless on my laptop working today, spikeb)
[09:01] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: cool
[09:01] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: i ran into a dapper nasty on a machine and decided to go back to breezy on it
[09:02] <Hexidigital_> what about using the edgy repos... frowned upon?
[09:02] <spikeb> i dont think there ARE edgy repos yet
[09:02] <Hexidigital_> also, does that mean i should stay away from dist-upgrades?
[09:02] <Healot> Ademan: yess, but when you run update-grub, it will append those options to ALL kernel images that you have
[09:02] <ompaul> Hexidigital_, why not wait until they actually start to really develop it, after the release, its name was announced, and I suggest you wait until "eft version 4" before you put it on your machine unless you can cope with it being down for extended periods of time
[09:02] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: i mean in the future
[09:03] <Hexidigital_> ompaul:: good deal
[09:03] <brn> QUESTION:  What impovements come with each new distro?  I paid US#80 for Redhat v6 in '99 thinking it wss the
[09:03] <ompaul> Hexidigital_, chasing the bleeding edge gets you cut
[09:03] <brn> very last word.
[09:03] <Ademan> Healot: oh so it doesnt actually do anythign unless you run update-grub? is there a line i can modify that grub will just check at startup?
[09:03] <Healot> brn: read the changelog :)
=== mumbles is now known as mumboles-workex
[09:04] <ompaul> brn, thats down the the specs and the meeting that defines each release, but lets put it this way its more interesting on a 6 month cycle
[09:04] <ompaul> brn, but if your doing servers doing dapper is a good deal
[09:04] <spikeb> bah
[09:05] <Healot> Ademan: yes at each kernel line...
[09:05] <spikeb> i should file a bug report, but i'm kind of clueless heh
[09:05] <Healot> check the lower section of that file
[09:05] <brn> No server here guys.  Just an old dude with an old machine.
[09:05] <spikeb> ompaul: am browsing through the bug reports there as we speak
[09:06] <ompaul> brn, depends on your definition of old :-) this box has only the original motherboard and proc on it, and power supply, and floppy, the rest has been upgraded, ram disks the works :-)
[09:07] <elknof1> hi everybody
[09:07] <petrik> Well I guess I shouldn't have gone for some obscure webcam from some obscure shop that does not appear on any of the lists I've seen so far. Cheap always turns to expensive in the end
[09:07] <elknof1> does anybody knows how to play a movie with mplayer??   its allocated in a microsoft network
[09:08] <w-mute> Hi. I try to connect to a WPA WLAN AP with NetworkManager on a Dapper machine but keep failing. I have some logs that don't help me lots. Could anybody of you have a look at them?
[09:08] <Healot> elkbuntu, if the file is on a Windows host, you may need to setup SAMBA, to dance
[09:08] <spikeb> hmm
[09:09] <Healot> elknof1: damn
[09:09] <achandra> hello all. New to ubuntu here....may jump suse ship to contribute here....doesnt play with bcm4318...kinda getting sick of their friking rpms..
[09:09] <anil> which is the small and best video player for ubuntu?
[09:09] <achandra> :)
[09:09] <brn> ompaul:  "Old"  1999 vintage 300 MHz K2.  Awesome (then) 3.2 GB drive.  No plan to upgrade before owners looming demise.  (just joking)
[09:09] <elkbuntu> yeah, stop doing that :P for the past week i get told stuff i didnt ask about...
[09:09] <Healot> damn tab
[09:09] <Healot> elknof1
[09:09] <elkbuntu> go to the 'n' you should be safe then :P
[09:10] <anil> which is the small and best video player for ubuntu?
[09:10] <Healot> lightweight anil?
[09:10] <Healot> VLC is recommended
[09:10] <achandra> w-mute: does your laptop use ndiswrapper and some form of wpa_supplicant?
[09:10] <anil> hwo to install vlc
[09:10] <elknof1> yeah...   its already running...  in fact i can play it in totem, but it stops every minut more less to "buffer"  and i just cant figure out how to fix it...   i've already chanched the conection speed to all of them... but nothing
[09:10] <petrik> On video players.... what is needed to play quicktime 7
[09:10] <holycow> totem-xine and w32codecs
[09:11] <achandra> is mplayer supported in ubuntu?
[09:11] <holycow> yes
[09:11] <achandra> with integration for firefox?
[09:11] <holycow> yes
[09:11] <achandra> that'll do it with the quicktime no?
[09:11] <Healot> achandra: it's on universe repos, so technically not, but the packages is maintained however
[09:11] <anil> couldnt find package error in apt-get
[09:11] <eggzeck> mozilla-mplayer
[09:11] <achandra> cool..
[09:12] <achandra> like said will likely jump ship..the whole yast thing aint working out for me anymore..
[09:12] <holycow> thats why i left suse years ago
[09:12] <achandra> hope peeps can help a brotha from another motha out... :)
[09:12] <elknof1> so...  there is no way to play a video file with mplayer on the network??   local network
[09:13] <holycow> meh, its apt, you need to know 6 commands to get around
[09:13] <Healot> if the file is on a Windows host, you may need to setup SAMBA, to dance, elknof1
[09:13] <anil> holycow tell me commands
[09:13] <achandra> so fill me in...newbie type question..only one iso cd required...and the rest is downloaded..ie open office etc?
[09:14] <achandra> or point me at docs...thats fine... :)
[09:14] <holycow> !apt
[09:14] <ubotu> rumour has it, apt is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AptGetHowTo/ or http://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#apt-howto
[09:14] <Flannel> achandra: they're on the CD, but yeah, the stuff that isn't included cna be downloaded
[09:14] <elknof1> healot, i have samba already running...   all working...
[09:14] <Healot> OO is on the CD achandra
[09:14] <achandra> just one cd??
[09:14] <Healot> elknof1, mount the share
[09:14] <Flannel> achandra: yes, only one CD.
[09:14] <Healot> achandra: yes!
[09:14] <achandra> holy hell thats sweet!!!
[09:14] <Hexidigital_> achandra:: welcome to ubuntu :)
[09:15] <achandra> none of that f'd up 6 cd crap
[09:15] <elknof1> oh...    yeah...   lol...  thanks.... healot
[09:15] <holycow> the rest you download off the net if you need to, but its 1 cd's wort of everything to get you started
[09:15] <Flannel> achandra: which distro?  debian 6cds?
[09:15] <Healot> mount -t nfs \\hostname\<share folder> <mount dir>, elknof1
[09:15] <achandra> suse
[09:15] <anil> any good book on ubuntu?
[09:15] <anil> ebook on ubuntu?
[09:15] <holycow> debian is like 1/3rd of a cd for netinstall
[09:15] <brn> Once there was OS2.  Fit nicely on a 270 MB (MegaByte!) drive with lots of room for useful applications.  What happend?
[09:15] <spikeb> debian is 14 cds
[09:15] <spikeb> heh
[09:15] <Ademan> anyone know why synaptic keeps complaining about packages.c ?
[09:15] <Healot> anil: in generel, linux books would do
[09:15] <Flannel> achandra: ah.  I was going t say, debian's CDs are just downloaded additional packages.  but yeah, one CD.
[09:15] <Hexidigital_> 14?!
[09:15] <anil> Debian is better than Ubuntu?
[09:15] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: you can download the entire repositories on CDs
[09:15] <holycow> well you don't need all 14
[09:15] <Ademan> anil: i wouldnt say that at all
[09:15] <Healot> anil: define better :)
[09:16] <holycow> you dl them if you need alocal copy of EVERYTHING
[09:16] <Hexidigital_> Flannel:: jeez.... i dont see that as being necessary :)
[09:16] <elknof1> healot, thanks a lot...
[09:16] <Ademan> well, debian users are elitists, so i suppose they THINK they're better
[09:16] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: well, it is nice if you have no broadband.
[09:16] <holycow> if you put ubuntu onto cds it would be the same number as debian
[09:16] <Hexidigital_> Flannel:: true
[09:16] <holycow> but no one here will long enough to actually try every single debian package
[09:16] <holycow> thus one only needs 1 cd
[09:17] <spikeb> yeah i've never actually used anything but a netinst cd to install debian
[09:17] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: and, no, you could download which ever CDs youd like.  CD1 was the installer, the rest were just additional packages, you could pick andchoose, etc.
[09:17] <Schalken> does debian by itself come with a desktop environment?
[09:17] <achandra> well according to http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major Mark Shuttleworth of Thawte fame used debian Sid to work of...is that right?
[09:17] <Hexidigital_> Flannel:: i see... i have the net installer of debian sarge
[09:17] <Flannel> Schalken: yes.  Just like ubuntu does.
[09:17] <Hexidigital_> i wasn't sure what those other few were for
[09:17] <spikeb> achandra: yes. ubuntu forks from debian sid at the beginning of every dev cycle
[09:17] <Flannel> achandra: yes.  Ubuntu is based on debian.
[09:17] <holycow> Schalken, if you choose it in the installer
[09:17] <achandra> nice...
[09:17] <Flannel> spikeb: that's not entirely true.
[09:18] <holycow> ubuntu isn't exactly a fork
[09:18] <achandra> are there any ubuntu developers here?
[09:18] <holycow> it just freezes debian unstable every 6 months
[09:18] <Healot> based, not fork or sister project
[09:18] <spikeb> it does a LOT more than freeze it
[09:18] <Hexidigital_> there is no spoon
[09:19] <holycow> sure but its not really a separate distro in the sense that other debian forks are
[09:19] <achandra> ive been playing quite a bit with openser and asterisk..and was wondering if there is port to ubuntu...
[09:19] <spikeb> holycow just because it forks more than once doesn't make it a spoon ;)
[09:19] <spikeb> brb
[09:19] <holycow> there was some controversy early on about why wasn't ubuntu a debian subproject
[09:19] <elknof1> healot, i've done that, the dir is already mounted...  but i've no idea how to play it with mplayer... it just dont open the file
[09:20] <achandra> holycow: it point blanck says on distrowatch one of the reasons..to have a seperate type project was to eliminate and fix the mistakes people were making with large scale distros..
[09:20] <Flannel> achandra: asterisk is in ubuntu repositories, yes. openser isnt.
[09:20] <achandra> once again...nice
[09:21] <holycow> i don't see that anywhere on the official ubuntu wiki
[09:21] <Schalken> is anyone here getting a Dapper CD shipped to them?
[09:21] <disinterested_pe> y when i run apt-get upate does it say im locked out?
[09:21] <achandra> i also like the fact that root is disabled by default and you have to use sudo...very very nice..
[09:21] <Flannel> Schalken: I imagine a lot of us are.  I am.
[09:21] <spikeb> !sabdfl
[09:21] <ubotu> [sabdfl]  Mark Shuttleworth, cosmonaut and founder of Canonical and Ubuntu
[09:22] <holycow> disinterested_pe, your account doesn't have sudo priviledges.  log into one that does and then use apt
[09:22] <spikeb> shuttleworth's entry on the wiki explains it a bit
[09:22] <disinterested_pe> ok
[09:22] <ompaul> brandon_, that would be a tad lower in spec than this 2001 AMD1900+
[09:22] <ompaul> brandon_, sorry :-) tabbed the wrong person
[09:22] <protocol1> tv shows are funny these days
[09:23] <ompaul> brn, sorry :-) tabbed the wrong person
[09:23] <achandra> As i read more...the more I like...
[09:23] <Schalken> i love ubuntu
[09:24] <achandra> what specifically do you like about ubuntu...is it just "everything" or support, the way it is laid out..etc?
[09:24] <holycow> for me i like the fact they stick close to debian
[09:24] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> lol I removed my main menu buttons on accendint (applications, places, and system) Now I cant figure out how to get them back.:(
[09:24] <holycow> i like that they freeze off of debian unstable every 6 months
[09:24] <holycow> i like that they freeze off of debian unstable every 6 months
[09:24] <holycow> sorry for doulbe post
[09:24] <holycow> i like apt
[09:25] <achandra> amazing that mandriva is 2 on the list..i hated the old mdk packaging..
[09:25] <Flannel> xxxBrAnDoNxxx: go to the top bar, right click, "add to panel" and look for them
[09:25] <spikeb> xxxBrAnDoNxxx: right click on the panel, and select add to panel. from there, select menu bar
[09:25] <holycow> and i haveto say that its great that mark has decided to spend enough money to polish off debian so to speak
[09:25] <holycow> ubuntu is what a debian desktop would be, if debian had 3 mil per year to spend on the polish
[09:26] <achandra> interesting...
[09:26] <holycow> actually, i guess it takes a lot more elbow grea$e to make a good desktop than i originally thought with just good ol debian
[09:26] <Flannel> holycow: eh, desktop polish isn't nearly as important as the userbase (that helps, instead of 'RTFM's)
[09:26] <Healot> holycow!
[09:26] <holycow> i really once thought you could do something like ubuntu with debian with a small dedicated team but ...
[09:26] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> Ohh, I looked in there all over! lol now I see it and got it back! thanx! and sorry for stupid question! :)
[09:26] <Hexidigital_> the users in #debian are rude
[09:26] <anil> Best theme for Ubuntu? Answer fastly
[09:26] <holycow> Flannel, well i'm a cranky bastard, it is appreciated in hindsight that you guys do keep it nice and friendly in here on purpose
[09:27] <holycow> debian by virtua of being a pure democracy attracts assholes and has a hard time throwing them out
[09:27] <Hexidigital_> anil:: crux
[09:27] <holycow> although i understand that has changed a bit recently
[09:27] <Healot> anil: best "Human"
[09:27] <achandra> well the point of a community is that it stays one..and it seems like Ubuntu has done a good job
[09:27] <Healot> especially the older ones... where there are girls wearing top only :)
[09:27] <holycow> Hexidigital, more specifically only a few bad apples are rude and the rest are democraticaly impotent to do anything about it
[09:27] <achandra> you should see some projects like ser forking open-ser....my god...thats ugly
[09:27] <Flannel> holycow: not only that, but it only gets better, because as we're helpful, people stay.  First as lurkers for more information, then they start dishing out factoids, etc.  Its a vicious cycle.
[09:27] <spikeb> i use ubuntulooks-industrial, and tango for icons
[09:28] <Hexidigital_> <---- (attn: Flannel )
[09:28] <holycow> Flannel, indeed, i never expected that at all actually
[09:28] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: what do you need?
[09:28] <Hexidigital_> i'm a lurker that dishes out factoids
[09:28] <achandra> lol
[09:28] <Flannel> ah.  heh.
[09:28] <egad> with respect to my wireless setup in ubuntu 5.10, when I do a iwconfig i get 'no wireless extensions' even though the driver is 'present and installed' - any ideas on how to get this to display correctly?
[09:28] <Hexidigital_> actually.... *tearing up* i like talking with you guys
[09:28] <disinterested_pe> which option do i choose to get sudo privilges?
[09:29] <holycow> Hexidigital, for example, factoid: your a lurker that dishes out factoids
[09:29] <holycow> hehe
[09:29] <Hexidigital_> :)
[09:29] <achandra> egad: lsmod shows?
[09:29] <egad> nada
[09:29] <egad> for the wireless
[09:29] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: in terminal or in gui?
[09:29] <achandra> unclaimed?
[09:29] <disinterested_pe> terminal
[09:29] <achandra> modprobe the device?
[09:30] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: just type sudo {command}
[09:30] <disinterested_pe> ok
[09:30] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: then it will prompt for password
[09:30] <achandra> we'll see where my suse linux breaks in here...lol...people stop me if im way the hell off....:)
[09:30] <achandra> so far its been enjoyable in here. :)
[09:30] <egad> achandra: did that.. it didnt seem to do anything.. no errors at least
[09:31] <achandra> is it a pci device?? lspci...or ??
[09:31] <egad> broadcom wireless.. builtin to my laptop
[09:31] <achandra> ahhhhhhh
[09:31] <achandra> bcm4318?
[09:31] <egad> *nods*
[09:31] <achandra> need ndiswrapper my friend
[09:32] <egad> i have it
[09:32] <achandra> is it a gateway??
[09:32] <disinterested_pe> ok that worked
[09:32] <holycow> achandra, no actually its not
[09:32] <achandra> acer..
[09:32] <egad> thus it says 'present and installed'
[09:32] <egad> no hp
[09:32] <holycow> you can get it working without ndis ... but i can't remember how
[09:32] <achandra> hmm..they seem to be used more and more..
=== benplaut is now known as benplaut|afk
[09:32] <egad> but i have the bcm driver already installed through ndiswrapper
[09:32] <achandra> i was having the same issue in suse...
[09:32] <Hexidigital_> egad:: i had the same problem
[09:32] <Hexidigital_> fixed it today, actually
[09:32] <achandra> with raw ndiswrapper module and wpa_supplicant
[09:32] <holycow> you can use the win driver but there is a linux driver
[09:32] <egad> Hexidigital: how did you manage that?
[09:33] <holycow> you haveto install it manually because it is restricted by policy
[09:33] <achandra> really!!!
[09:33] <achandra> where??
[09:33] <holycow> licencing issue of some sort
[09:33] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell egad about fwcutter
[09:33] <achandra> got a link for that driver..
[09:33] <egad> i should point out that now the wireless light is lit up hehe.. before it wasnt..
[09:33] <holycow> for one, its available in dapper under the restricted kernel modules ... in breezy i can't remember any more
[09:33] <Hexidigital_> egad:: when you do that, pm me
[09:33] <xxxBrAnDoNxxx> ohh, I have 1  more question. under the "places menu" how do I remove the recent documents?
[09:33] <Hexidigital_> well... not pm... in the channel
[09:33] <Hexidigital_> for ALL TO HEAR! :)
[09:33] <egad> oh ok.. but first ubotu needs to msg me

[09:34] <achandra> nice
[09:34] <w-mute> Hi. I try to connect to a WPA WLAN AP with NetworkManager on a Dapper machine but keep failing. Logs say "pre-shared key may be incorrect" but the same key works under MacOS. Any idea?
[09:34] <Hexidigital_> holycow:: i just sent him that
[09:34] <Hexidigital_> (me thinks)
[09:34] <holycow> Hexidigital, sorry
[09:34] <disinterested_pe> will sudo apt-get install work for tar files?
[09:34] <achandra> g'damn it took for ever in suse to get that working...
[09:35] <w-mute> disinterested_pe: nope, won't.
[09:35] <egad> i cant do it that way.. i only have wireless.. so no apt-get's
[09:35] <holycow> ah crap that uses ndiswrapper
[09:35] <disinterested_pe> ok
[09:35] <holycow> *hmm*
[09:35] <achandra> yup...looks like it does...
[09:35] <disinterested_pe> what types of files will it work for? any?
[09:35] <achandra> it uses a version 2 driver....
[09:35] <egad> and besides.. the driver is installed technically.. :c/
[09:36] <achandra> and i think when you use wpa_supplicant there is a part to use ndis_wrapper..
[09:36] <nicko> looking for suggestions of mud clients
[09:36] <nicko> anyone?
[09:36] <Hexidigital_> ok, egad i cannot guarantee this works for you, but it did for me
[09:36] <achandra> when you do a wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D ndiswrapper does it complain like hell?
[09:36] <Hexidigital_> lemme pastebin my /etc/network/interfaces file... hold please
[09:36] <Hexidigital_> wait
[09:37] <Hexidigital_> egad:: do you have ndis installed?
[09:37] <holycow> oh okay i see, my mistake.  broadcom driver is now part of kernel tree, that is why its supported under dapper and not breezy
[09:37] <egad> Hexidigital: ndiswrapper? yes
[09:37] <holycow> sorry you will haveto follow the ndis guide to setting that up under breezy
[09:37] <achandra> later kernel version has support right??
[09:37] <achandra> i think its 2.6.17 and above or something...
[09:38] <achandra> is that right?
[09:38] <Hexidigital_> egad:: sorry, can't help you... i disown ndis, so my walkthrough will not help you
[09:38] <achandra> lol
[09:38] <egad> greatttt
[09:38] <Hexidigital_> sorry, bud
[09:38] <egad> yep..
[09:38] <achandra> ndis can be a blessing and a horrid bitch
[09:38] <holycow> Hexidigital, heh me too, i refuse to use any windows software
[09:38] <egad> well anyone else have any other ideas? ndis or not
[09:38] <Hexidigital_> ndis to me is a redheaded step-child
[09:38] <Hexidigital_> proverbially
[09:39] <achandra> egad: when you compiled wpa_supplicant is the .config file setup to use ndiswrapper support?
[09:39] <egad> achandra: no wpa_supplicant
[09:39] <achandra> you're not using wpa...okay...that helps...correct?
[09:39] <egad> achandra: correct.. no wpa
[09:40] <achandra> should be a little...i mean...a little..like minutely..easier..
[09:40] <Hexidigital_> wpa_supplicant makes dhcp access points angry
[09:40] <Hexidigital_> imho
[09:40] <achandra> indeed..its a bitch
[09:41] <Healot> my suggestion for ndiswrappered wifi
[09:41] <achandra> okay...the ndiswrapper...is it from source...
[09:41] <Hexidigital_> holycow:: thanks for saying breezy isn't supporting bcm43xx... i did not know that, and couldnt' figure out why i couldnt install it
[09:41] <Hexidigital_> -idot +idiot
[09:41] <Healot> if there is something wrong with WPA+password setting, just leave it WEP+no password
[09:41] <holycow> naw, just a different spot on the learning curve
[09:42] <Healot> I know it isn't secure but use it as a last resort
[09:42] <Hexidigital_> same page, different books ?  :)
[09:42] <egad> achandra: ndiswrapper -l displays "bcmw15: driver present, hardware present"
[09:42] <holycow> lol
[09:42] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: you use bcm43?
[09:42] <achandra> yeah....its there...
[09:42] <achandra> but when you do an lsmod ndiswrapper shows 0 right? I had that issue too.
[09:43] <achandra> or is that incorrect..
[09:43] <disinterested_pe> holy crap i just typed apt-cache pkgname lol
[09:43] <Healot> i have a rt usb now... my older dell laptop has it, and my ibm intel 2100 works fine though
[09:43] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: what came up? anything good?
[09:43] <disinterested_pe> idk
[09:43] <Hexidigital_> ah
[09:43] <disinterested_pe> its a long list
[09:43] <egad> "lsmod ndiswrapper" ???
[09:44] <Hexidigital_> Healot:: what brand usb? (in case i have a prob when edgy v.4 comes out)
[09:44] <disinterested_pe> im just learning lol
[09:44] <egad> achandra: "lsmod | grep ndiswrapper" gives me 0
[09:44] <Spaceraver> argh... i am about to go nuts on this installer disc... ubuntu 6.06 cd... and i dont know how to make a checksum of it in windoze
[09:44] <achandra> yeah..i had that as well..
[09:44] <Healot> RT2500 usb wifi
[09:44] <egad> achandra: cool, how'd you resolve it?
[09:44] <Healot> small but smooth...
[09:45] <Hexidigital_> cool... did you have to tinker with drivers, Healot ?
[09:45] <disinterested_pe> hexidigital what os ru on?
[09:45] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: Ubuntu 6.06
[09:45] <achandra> egad: quite honestly...i didnt.. i just went with the message.. and discovered that in fact my bcm came up when i did the following
[09:45] <Healot> Hexidigital: just compile the one from rt2x00.serialmonkey.com
[09:45] <disinterested_pe> ok ive got that comming
[09:46] <petrik> How can you locate the chipset for your webcam?
[09:46] <Hexidigital_> cool
[09:46] <disinterested_pe> did u have 5.10?
[09:46] <achandra> egad: im not sure in ubuntu but I basically added a card, called it wlan0 and used module ndiswrapper
[09:46] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: yes, a while back
[09:46] <egad> achandra: hmms.. how do you add a card? hehe
[09:46] <achandra> egad: is there a tool that you can add the card ?
[09:46] <disinterested_pe> so what can be done on 6.06 versus 5.10?
[09:47] <Healot> petrik: try lspci...
[09:47] <achandra> achandra: in yast..it gave a choice to add a card...and not specify what kind..and use ndiswrapper as the module.
[09:47] <egad> ehehe
[09:47] <achandra> egad:  in yast..it gave a choice to add a card...and not specify what kind..and use ndiswrapper as the module.
[09:47] <achandra> im getting old and tired...lol
[09:47] <holycow> disasm, a lot more laptop hardware support
[09:48] <egad> achandra: forgive my 'newbieness' but what is yast? hehe
[09:48] <holycow> disasm, sorry wrong tab complete, i meant disinterested_pe
[09:48] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: what holycow said
[09:48] <achandra> its like the equivalent of the system tools for any linux os.. i guess.
[09:48] <achandra> mandrake has drakconf, redhat uses system-config-whatever, etc..
[09:49] <disinterested_pe> hummmm so its better huh?
=== carthik is now known as carthik_zZz
[09:49] <egad> achandra: oh ok.. is that installed as default?
[09:49] <holycow> disinterested_pe, depends on your definition of better
[09:49] <holycow> its certainly newer
[09:49] <achandra> egad: are there graphical tools to add a card ??
[09:49] <achandra> in ubuntu
[09:49] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: if newer is better, than yes
[09:49] <egad> achandra: I have no idea.. ive only been in ubuntu.. and linux really.. for about 3 or 4 days.. hehe
[09:50] <achandra> egad: hey!! what happens when you type ifup wlan0?
[09:50] <disinterested_pe> well do u consider 6.06 better or just newer?
[09:50] <holycow> personally, just newer
[09:50] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: both, imo
[09:50] <holycow> better doesn't relaly mean anything to me
[09:50] <petrik> It's a USB CVC-301 webcam, the box says colorviz but the windows program refers to it as vimicro
[09:50] <achandra> egad: ill be working this out pretty soon myself..so if you dont get it worked out we can work on it together...
[09:50] <egad> achandra: 'ignoring unknown interface wlan0=wlan0'
[09:50] <holycow> i can't measure better, i can measure newer
[09:51] <Healot> of course newer version has more new features and they were meant to overcome past version's weaknesses
[09:51] <disinterested_pe> ok so for a newbie it should be a real challenge huh?
[09:51] <holycow> not really
[09:51] <holycow> if you are using breezy now, all of your knowledge translates
[09:51] <rene> i would like to use my british keyboard, but ubuntu keeps setting it to german layout, what file do i have to edit to change that annoying behavior, a temporary solution is to change it via setxkmap gb, but i hate to enter that every time
[09:51] <disinterested_pe> ok holycow
[09:51] <egad> achandra: cool i'd appreciate any additional help :c)
[09:52] <disinterested_pe> im glad u guys dont discourage ppl
[09:52] <achandra> egad: lets try some other stuff yeah...you might be help me out...
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: what do you mean?
[09:52] <disinterested_pe> meaning ur trying to help not hinder ppl
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> ah
[09:53] <achandra> egad: can you type this for me..
[09:53] <egad> achandra: sure :c)
[09:53] <achandra> egad: ndiswrapper -m
[09:53] <achandra> or
[09:53] <Healot> holycow!
[09:53] <achandra> /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper -,
[09:53] <holycow> yeeeeesssss..s..?
[09:53] <achandra> /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper -m
[09:54] <egad> achandra: i already did ndiswrapper -m a bit ago  didnt seem to do anything.. i guess it just adds it to some boot listing hehe
[09:54] <disinterested_pe> ive got to go turn my iguanas lights off
[09:54] <achandra> egad let go here..
[09:54] <achandra> egad: go to /etc/
[09:54] <egad> ok
[09:54] <achandra> then vi modprobe.conf
[09:55] <egad> ok
[09:55] <egad> no modprobe.conf in that folder
[09:55] <Hexidigital_> woohoo!  matrix 2 and 3 back to back
[09:55] <achandra> where is modprobe.conf in ubuntu?
[09:56] <spikeb> Hexidigital_: what channel, and what timezone?
[09:56] <spikeb> heh
[09:56] <achandra> egad: type find / -name modprobe.conf
[09:56] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: EST or GMT-500 on TBS (united states)
[09:56] <holycow> disinterested_pe, as a side project some day, hook up your iguana light to a controller, hook up the controller to some networking controllers, put it on the network, and turn it off from your system
[09:56] <holycow> >_<
[09:56] <achandra> egad: that should tell us where the file is...
[09:56] <Hexidigital_> spikeb:: 3 is coming on now
[09:57] <achandra> anybody know off the top of their head where modprobe.conf is in ubuntu??
[09:57] <Hexidigital_> achandra:: you on ubuntu now?
[09:57] <egad> achandra: a bunch of places lol
[09:57] <achandra> not yet...waiting for download..lol
[09:57] <petrik> I got info on the USB ports but not what is attached to them with lspci
[09:57] <Hexidigital_> achandra:: in terminal, type 'whereis modprobe.conf' without quotes
[09:57] <Cyphir> hi can anyone help me with a partition problem?
[09:57] <achandra> egad: what Hexidigital said...lol
[09:58] <holycow> achandra, locate modprobe.conf is a good tool
[09:58] <Healot> Cyphir: LVM?
[09:58] <Hexidigital_> egad::  in terminal, type 'whereis modprobe.conf' without quotes
[09:58] <achandra> and classic find / -name "whatever" works too right?
[09:58] <Cyphir> Healot: I don't thnk so, its a problem about resizing pre-existing partitions
[09:58] <spikeb> yes achandra
[09:59] <achandra> but of course...:)
[09:59] <Cyphir> Healot: I want to delete my windows partition and place my existing linux partiton in its place without losing any fata
[09:59] <achandra> spikeb: thanks.
[09:59] <achandra> egad: find it?
[09:59] <petrik> It's rather frustrating. It seems to have handled everything else vey well. I gues in time I'll figure it all out. Tried to compile a driver from source code. Failed. I put it down to not having a clue what I'm doing
[09:59] <johnnybezak> hey guys, something is resetting my hostname to 10.1.1.1 and it's a gnome application. i have to constantly open /etc/resolv.conf and change it. what do you think is doing this?
[09:59] <egad> achandra: uhh i find modprobe.conf.5.gz lol
[09:59] <egad> find=found
[10:00] <achandra> that cant be it...does the locate find it..
[10:00] <petrik> Cypher have you got your data on a seperate drive or partition?
[10:00] <Hexidigital_> egad:: that's not it
[10:00] <twibbler> Can anybody help me setup a USB printer please.
[10:00] <achandra> egad: you have to find where that file or its equivalent is...trust me..we are close..
[10:00] <Cyphir> petrik: partition
[10:00] <Healot> you can use a third party partitioner like Partition Magic
[10:00] <Hexidigital_> egad:: that means modprobe.conf is not there
[10:01] <Cyphir> petrik: can i send you a picture of my partitions with gparterd?
[10:01] <egad> achandra: no modprobe.conf it appears.. 'modprobe' yes 'modprobe.modutils' yes 'modprobe.Lmodutils' yes and modprobe.d yes but no modprobe.conf
[10:01] <disinterested_pe> i am quite impressed how much faster this is than xp
[10:01] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: you installing now?
[10:01] <Hexidigital_> disinterested_pe:: or running it?
[10:01] <achandra> Hexidigital_: how is that possible...where are modules reffered to in ubuntu?
[10:01] <petrik> sure.... not that I know what gparted is
[10:01] <disinterested_pe> im still installing packages for ubuntu
[10:01] <achandra> or aliased..sorry

[10:02] <egad> yes those
[10:02] <Hexidigital_> achandra:: get that pm?
[10:03] <Cyphir> http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=9964&d=1148475872 contains a picture
[10:03] <achandra> yep
[10:03] <Hexidigital_> whoops, nm achandra
[10:03] <achandra> got it
[10:03] <Hexidigital_> i meant to not scroll in the channel
[10:03] <petrik> With M$ I already had everything partitioned off. OS on one, programs on another, and data on a different drive (ran out room on the first)
[10:03] <morphix> err.. i forgot how to display all the current users of the system in shell? can someone help?
[10:03] <Hexidigital_> egad, did your system show the same thing?
[10:03] <egad> Hexidigital: yep
[10:04] <egad> wel
[10:04] <egad> l
[10:04] <Cyphir> morphix, try id?
[10:04] <egad> Hexidigital: i also had an Lmodutils too
[10:04] <Hexidigital_> egad:: those are different directories... you have to cd in terminal
[10:04] <achandra> right..
[10:04] <egad> Hexidigital: yes I know..
[10:04] <egad> Hexidigital: but what am I doing with them? hehe
[10:04] <Hexidigital_> open with nano.. sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d
[10:04] <morphix> Cyphir, that doesnt show all the users
[10:05] <petrik> Then when I was installing took note of the partition sizes to locate them in the installer so I knew what to format and what to leave
[10:05] <morphix> i dont want their permissions.. just what users are on the system
[10:05] <achandra> let me ask the question a different way..when aliasing a module it will be in modprobe.d in ubuntu right?
[10:05] <egad> thats a directory
[10:05] <Cyphir> petrik, so what are u suggesting?
[10:05] <achandra> ahh..
[10:06] <egad> achandra: let me try something heh heh heh hehehe
[10:06] <petrik> Only thing is that the data drive is in NTFS and I understand this can lead to issues
[10:06] <achandra> egad: we must alias the module in the proper place...thats what im trying to get at..:)
[10:06] <achandra> and then we'll be a step furthrer
[10:06] <petrik> Cypher: well how is your set up right now? Is it all on one drive/partition?
[10:07] <Cyphir> petrik, this url will show u a picture on how they are set up ibbler has quit ("Ex-Chat")

[10:07] <disinterested_pe> im installing that torcs game
[10:07] <egad> achandra: oh ok
[10:07] <egad> achandra: so what exactly is this proper place? hehehe
[10:08] <hejux> hello
[10:08] <Spaceraver> ehm... how do i find the md5sum for cd ver of 6.06
[10:08] <petrik> Hold on need to register on forum first
[10:08] <egad> hejux: hi
[10:08] <Cyphir> petrik, thanks alot =)
[10:08] <achandra> thats is what we are looking for...where modules get aliased...in ubuntu.. its typically modprobe.conf
[10:08] <hejux> i dont know why when i install ubuntu from network, it default install gnome and all its apps !
[10:08] <achandra> but not too sure...in ubuntu
[10:09] <hejux> i dont want that much apps !
[10:09] <egad> achandra: i found a file called aliases hehe in /etc/modprobe.d/
[10:09] <achandra> ahhhh..
[10:09] <crimsun> /don't/ use modprobe.conf.
[10:09] <hejux> egad,
[10:09] <hejux> hi
[10:09] <achandra> crimsun: okay....so the aliases file is the proper one?
[10:10] <crimsun> achandra: any file under /etc/modprobe.d/
[10:10] <hejux> i install ubuntu using grub ,and why it default install gnome for me ?
[10:10] <hejux> i dont want gnome
[10:10] <spikeb> ubuntu is gnome based
[10:10] <achandra> egad: that file aliases...does it alias any drivers...?
[10:10] <crimsun> achandra: using /etc/modprobe.conf will bypass /etc/modprobe.d/, which I guarantee is semantically /not/ what you want
[10:11] <achandra> agreed...
[10:11] <Cyphir> hejux, if you want a kde based "ubuntu" use kubuntu and if you want an xfce one i think use xbuntu
[10:11] <hejux> it is based on gnome ?
[10:11] <Healot> hejux: grub - boot manager, gnome is the desktop enviroment, not related at all
[10:11] <crimsun> achandra: what do you need modprobe to do?
[10:11] <achandra> crimsun: that is the advice I was looking for...i didnt know how ubuntu deals with it...thanks...
[10:11] <hejux> it cant run without gnome
[10:11] <Cyphir> hejux. gnome is the GUI
[10:12] <achandra> well I need to alias the following alias wlan0 ndiswrapper
[10:12] <hejux> i know !
[10:12] <Cyphir> hejux, so all you want is a command line?
[10:12] <egad> achandra: uhmmm it has 'character devices' and 'misc'  hehe
[10:12] <hejux> i know it , i mean , i want to install ubuntu without any X
[10:12] <hejux> yes , command line
[10:12] <Cyphir> hejux, then
[10:12] <achandra> crumsun: did you get that?
[10:12] <Cyphir> hejux, at the install prompt for ubuntu type "server"
[10:13] <crimsun> achandra: you could append it to aliases if you wish
[10:13] <Cyphir> hejux, when it asks you for type of install type in server insteald of defauly
[10:13] <Cyphir> default*
[10:13] <achandra> ahhhh...nice...
[10:13] <achandra> egad: to the bottom of the aliases file add the following
[10:13] <egad> achandra: ok so what am I to do? and will this blow up my laptop? :cP
[10:14] <achandra> egad: no blow ups...it just wont work if we are wrong...
[10:14] <hejux> <Cyphir> the thing is it didnot ask me to type anything
[10:14] <achandra> egad: the interface that is...
[10:14] <egad> achandra: ok ready for action :cP
[10:14] <Cyphir> hejux, i mean put in the installation disk in
[10:14] <achandra> egad: add this - alias wlan0 ndiswrapper
[10:14] <achandra> thats it..
[10:14] <Cyphir> hejux, and reinstall ubuntu
[10:14] <petrik> Cypher: Sorry what was the actual problem you had?
[10:14] <achandra> egad: familiar with vi right?
[10:14] <egad> achandra: done
[10:14] <Cyphir> petrik, i want to move my ext3 linux partition over to me larger Windows partition
[10:15] <egad> achandra: you betcha
[10:15] <Cyphir> petrik, and delete windows
[10:15] <achandra> achandra: now modprobe ndiswrapper again
[10:15] <egad> achandra: done now what? hehe
[10:15] <achandra> iwconfig?
[10:15] <Cyphir> hejux, go  Applications --> Accesories --> Terminal for a command line
[10:16] <egad> 'no wireless extensions' on lo, eth0, and sit0
[10:16] <yggdrasil> hello guys i have a firewall script. and id like it to load up at boot. before most of the other things is it good in rc.d s00 ?

[10:16] <achandra> im wondering do you have to have wireless-tools installed too?
[10:17] <Cyphir> hejux, you didn't install via the install disk?
[10:17] <hejux> yes
[10:17] <egad> achandra: how would I know?
[10:17] <hejux> i dont installed from CD

[10:18] <achandra> yggdrasil: yes??
[10:18] <egad> achandra: yes
[10:19] <egad> achandra: thats where im seeing 'no wireless extensions'

[10:19] <hejux> so , i dont have ubuntu  installed on my hard
[10:19] <Cyphir> hejux, what you can do is install an install disk from the site
[10:19] <achandra> weird
[10:19] <petrik> Cypher: Maybe I'm way of the mark here but would delete the windows partion and then use the move icon to move ext3 to it. I am assuming you do not need the data on the windows partition
[10:19] <Ademan> anyone have any clue why oogle's dvd playback might be choppy?
[10:19] <hejux> Cyphir, ok ,i see , thanks
[10:19] <yggdrasil> achandra yea thats the cmd
[10:19] <Cyphir> hejux, and continue until it promps u for install type
[10:19] <achandra> egad: let me take a look at some stuff... its weird...

[10:22] <rahul> hello is there anyway to disable the boot screen in ubuntu
[10:22] <achandra> its an hp after all ..
[10:22] <Lunarctic> hola
[10:22] <egad> hehe
[10:22] <Lunarctic> what's a good ubuntu program for making floppy images?
[10:22] <egad> achandra: its taking some time on 'configuring network interfaces'
[10:22] <nhaines> rahul, you mean the graphical splash screen?
[10:22] <achandra> k...
[10:22] <yggdrasil> ive been playing with all the wireless stuff actualy i jsut did a box that sits on my rooftop with a wireless card on it and i route from my lan to it to somones ap
[10:22] <rahul> yes
[10:22] <rahul> how to do that
[10:22] <nhaines> rahul, add "nosplash" to your kernel options, you can add it in /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:23] <egad> achandra: ok back
[10:23] <rahul> ok thanx
[10:23] <Nameeater> where would I put fonts I want to use in the GIMP?
[10:23] <achandra> egad: try that iwconfig command again..maybe its there..but doubt it.
[10:23] <egad> achandra: same results hehe
[10:24] <achandra> yeah...hang on for one sec
[10:24] <egad> achandra: the command is there.,.. its just none of my devices are linked to wireless
=== ubuntu is now known as H080J03
[10:25] <Lunarctic> im running H080J03
[10:25] <Lunarctic> :)
[10:25] <H080J03> i have no more blank CDs but i need to burn ubuntu to a disk can i just burn a CD iso file to a DVD, would it work?
[10:26] <Lunarctic> you can, but it'd be a waste of space on the disk
[10:26] <H080J03> so it will work?
[10:26] <Lunarctic> you can't unburn it then and it sucks having a dvd with 400megs on it
[10:26] <H080J03> i don't care
[10:26] <achandra> egad: back...google says there is a "network tool"..are you familiar with that..??
[10:26] <Lunarctic> it will work, but its kinda a waste of time
[10:26] <yggdrasil> egad try lspci
[10:26] <Lunarctic> lol, then go for it
[10:26] <H080J03> i have about 300 blank dvds and 0 blank cds
[10:26] <H080J03> k
[10:26] <H080J03> thx
[10:26] <egad> achandra: nope never heard of it
[10:27] <spikeb> haha H080J03
[10:27] <yggdrasil> egad what about ifconfig
[10:27] <Lunarctic> lol
[10:27] <Lunarctic> i have neither
[10:27] <egad> yggdrasil: oh thats a network tool.. uhmm yeah hehe ifconfig works
[10:27] <Lunarctic> but i find that dvd's are a waste of money, coz most stuff comes on multiple cd's anyways
[10:28] <yggdrasil> does ifconfig list your wireless card
[10:28] <H080J03> hey spikeB the copy of drapper idownloaded burnt to my last cd and it got corropted
[10:28] <egad> yggdrasil: nope
[10:28] <yggdrasil> ahh
[10:28] <yggdrasil> do an lspci
[10:28] <H080J03> and i found out it was corrpoted half way thur the install
[10:28] <spikeb> H080J03: that sucks
[10:28] <yggdrasil> and see if you can see your wireless cardd what kinda card is it btw ?
[10:28] <H080J03> so now i am going off of live cds
[10:28] <H080J03> yea i know
[10:28] <H080J03> i am redownloading drapper
[10:28] <Lunarctic> yeah, i downloaded the livecd for dapper, but i can't boot
[10:29] <egad> yggdrasil: yeah at the bottom.. '0000:06:02.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation: Unknown device 4318 (rev 02)
[10:29] <Lunarctic> H080 - is it the problem where it boots, but nothing works in graphical?
[10:29] <nhaines> Ouch.  :(  Better to test the integrity before you install!
[10:29] <achandra> egad: lets try something different...are you using dapper?
[10:29] <deadcat> how is wine on amd64bit?
[10:29] <egad> yggdrasil: I also have below it an 'ethernet controller' but i think thats the actual real ethernet hehe
[10:29] <yggdrasil> is it a linksys
[10:29] <egad> achandra: nope 5.10
[10:29] <yggdrasil> linksys wireless card
[10:30] <deadcat> yggdrasil: that doesnt tell us shit.. what chipset?
[10:30] <yggdrasil> broadcom
[10:30] <egad> yggdrasil: no silly.. its a broadcom corporation :cP
[10:30] <Hexidigital_> deadcat:: language please
[10:30] <egad> 4318
[10:30] <deadcat> yggdrasil: ndis
[10:30] <yggdrasil> chek your dmesg and syslog
[10:30] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell yggdrasil about fwcutter

[10:30] <ubotu> My cat's name is Mittens! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, liquidindian
[10:31] <yggdrasil> tell him not me hha i pulled that card out after messing with it for about 2 hours
[10:31] <Lunarctic> rofl
[10:31] <achandra> egad: is 5.10 older than dapper..thats breezy...or??
[10:31] <liquidindian> Is artsd only a KDE thing, not Gnome?
[10:31] <deadcat> is getting wine working with windows apps easy on amd 64 bit?
[10:31] <Ng> achandra: 5.10 is breezy, dapper is 6.06
[10:31] <egad> achandra: yeah breezy
[10:31] <deadcat> liquidindian: true
[10:32] <liquidindian> Does it tell you what apps are using sound in KDE?  Is there an equivalent for Gnome?
[10:32] <achandra> egad: yep we are stuck with ndis.. we'll have to tough it out
[10:33] <egad> achandra: boo hehe im going to try something else.. wish me luck that i dont make matters worse hehehe
[10:33] <Hexidigital_> liquidindian:: just double click the volume icon on your toolbar
[10:33] <deadcat> is there where i ask about 64bit?
[10:33] <Hexidigital_> deadcat:: yes
[10:34] <chimai> 'lo :)
[10:34] <liquidindian> The problem I'm having is here: http://forum.linspire.com/viewtopic.php?t=308559&sid=55dd5d4999a8e19ec6e5d0edb8666dd0
[10:34] <deadcat> hows wine+win apps+64bit? like office and stuff
[10:34] <achandra> egad: did you compile the ndiswrapper from source or ?? use rpm
[10:34] <Hexidigital_> not sure, deadcat, i dont use wine
[10:35] <Hexidigital_> stick around, however, i'm sure someone can answer your question
[10:35] <deadcat> k
[10:35] <achandra> egad: one more question the hp model of laptop?
[10:35] <achandra> egad: still there?
=== raptixx is now known as raptix
[10:36] <deadcat> achandra: why use the rpm? doesnt ubuntu already have the ndis driver/source?
[10:36] <egad> achandra: yeah im here
[10:36] <egad> achandra: hp dv5020
[10:36] <Hexidigital_> yggdrasil:: are you trying the walkthrough i sent you?
[10:36] <egad> achandra: i download ndiswrapper from sourceforge it was a deb file
[10:37] <yggdrasil> uh its egad hats having the problem
[10:37] <Hexidigital_> ah
[10:37] <yggdrasil> my stuffs running great...
[10:37] <egad> lol
[10:37] <Hexidigital_> egad insists on using ndis.... :(
[10:37] <H080J03> any one know how to kill time??
[10:37] <ubuntu> What's up?
[10:37] <yggdrasil> ive gota box in a 5 gallon bucket on the roof connected to some poor bastards cable ..
[10:37] <Psychotron> Hello! Does anyone know where can I find help for setting up resolutions with Intel 810 onboard ?
[10:38] <achandra> egad: ahhh...okay... i just found something..on the ubuntuforums...where the dude had trouble...and used source to get it all singing..
[10:38] <Ng> H080J03: I think the universe might object to that ;)
[10:38] <Auckland_Pig> how do i get an email address at the end of my nickname instead of an IP address in IRC
[10:38] <Ng> H080J03: what do you mean, exactly?
[10:38] <H080J03> i am waiting for ubuntu to download
[10:38] <H080J03> i am on a live disc
[10:38] <Ng> ah :)
[10:38] <Ng> Applications->Games ;)
[10:38] <deadcat> H080J03: then wait
[10:38] <H080J03> already went thur them all
[10:38] <achandra> egad: see N0ah420 comment -- http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=162853&highlight=ndiswrapper
[10:38] <H080J03> waiting is hard
[10:39] <Psychotron> I'm new with linux. Highest resolution I can get now is 1024x786 and I would like to use 1280... Worked with windows ok.
[10:39] <Hexidigital_> H080J03:: how can you kill time, if time does not exist?
[10:39] <Auckland_Pig> H080J03: wikipedia
[10:39] <H080J03> yea
[10:39] <H080J03> good idea
[10:39] <Hexidigital_> Psychotron:: on a laptop?
[10:39] <deadcat> H080J03: too bad.. if you need to ask someone else how to kill time. you have a problem
[10:39] <Psychotron> No, desktop computer.
[10:39] <H080J03> ill just press the good ol random page button
[10:39] <deadcat> or you just want attention from irc
[10:39] <Hexidigital_> PsyberOne:: intel video chipset?
[10:39] <morphix> so yeh.. how the.. do i display what users are currently in the system using shell?
[10:40] <egad> achandra: his way wont work.. since he is using apt-get for part of it hehe
[10:40] <deadcat> morphix: who
[10:40] <morphix> not who is logged in
[10:40] <Auckland_Pig> how can i backup a few folders on my windows to Ubuntu Server on SSH
[10:40] <deadcat> morphix: cat /etc/passwd
[10:40] <morphix> i mean.. what users the system has.. but i am using SHELL to display it
[10:40] <Psychotron> Intel Video yeah. Integrated to motherboard.
[10:40] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig, get Filezilla on Windows.
[10:40] <achandra> egad: see this part --- ) blacklist bcm43xx
[10:40] <achandra> 2) Remove (with --purge) ndiswrapper
[10:40] <achandra> 3) rm /etc/ndiswrapper and /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper
[10:40] <achandra> 4) reboot
[10:40] <achandra> 5) download ndiswrapper source
[10:40] <achandra> 6) build and install
[10:40] <deadcat> Auckland_Pig: scp
[10:40] <achandra> sorry..shoulda pastebin that..
[10:41] <Auckland_Pig> nhaines: deadcat: how do i automate it?
[10:41] <Hexidigital_> PsyberOne:: you can try sudo apt-get install 915resolution, or 855resolution (depending on chipset)
[10:41] <deadcat> Auckland_Pig: cron
[10:41] <Hexidigital_> PsyberOne:: than restart X
[10:41] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig: use Samba and cron.
[10:41] <Auckland_Pig> i want to backup some folders on my windows machine.... oh ok
[10:41] <deadcat> is ubuntu gonna be at linuxworld?
[10:41] <Auckland_Pig> !samba
[10:41] <Psychotron> Hexi: Ok. I'll try. Chipset is 810 I think.
[10:41] <ubotu> I heard samba is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba or http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba2/book/toc.html
[10:42] <Hexidigital_> PsyberOne:: k... let me know
[10:42] <egad> achandra: i see a problem
[10:42] <achandra> egad: ohh?
[10:42] <Psychotron> ok
[10:42] <calamari> hi
[10:42] <egad> achandra: "It goes without saying that you are using a kernel >= to 2.6.15 to use the bcm43xx driver."
[10:42] <chimai> I'm trying to install vmplayer with the tar.gz and the install script asked me "What is the location of the "gcc" program on your machine?". I installed the "gcc" package with synpatic, and answered "/usr/bin/gcc-4.0". It was a succes.
[10:42] <chimai> But I'm stuck at the next step. It asks me "What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include] ". I don't know what to do... could you please help me?
[10:43] <Hexidigital_> egad:: why is that a problem?
[10:43] <Hexidigital_> what kernel do you have?
[10:43] <egad> Hexidigital: uname -a says I'm using 2.6.12-9 isnt this older?
[10:43] <Hexidigital_> egad:: uname -r
[10:43] <ikor> chimai: install kernel headers package
[10:43] <calamari> I was copying a very large file when the progress stopped for quite a while, so I tried to cancel, which didn't work, so I force quitted it, but my hd is still on solid and the system is definitely not responding to disk at full speed.  How can I tell gnome to stop copying for real?
[10:43] <achandra> egad: yeah dont click on that link its irrelevent for us..
[10:43] <Hexidigital_> yes, numerically, that would be older
[10:43] <egad> Hexidigital: shows the same kernel number though hehe
[10:44] <deadcat> calamari: kill
[10:44] <achandra> egad: its the stuff above the link that we want to do..
[10:44] <calamari> deadcat: kill what
[10:44] <Hexidigital_> egad:: did you do the sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[10:44] <deadcat> calamari: PID
[10:44] <achandra> egad: ie use make to compile it etc...
[10:44] <calamari> deadcat: do you know, are you just being sarcastic?
[10:44] <egad> Hexidigital: no.. i have no internet access.. the reason for me trying to get wireless going hehe :cP
[10:44] <Hexidigital_> ugh
[10:44] <deadcat> calamari: ps -ef, look for PID. then kill
[10:45] <Hexidigital_> egad:: that could be a problem
[10:45] <egad> *nods*
[10:45] <deadcat> calamari: that sound sarcastic to you?
[10:45] <calamari> deadcat: I have a bunch of stuff running..
[10:45] <deadcat> calamari: you just said they are not responding
[10:45] <chimai> ikor : ok, i'm taking a look (excuse my english :s )
[10:45] <Auckland_Pig> how do i use cron on my windows machine?
[10:45] <calamari> deadcat: no, I said that I force quitted the copy dialog
[10:46] <achandra> Hexidigital: that was pretty tricky of you asking him a recursive type question/asnwer ;)
[10:46] <deadcat> Auckland_Pig: windows DONT have cron. it has that taskthing
[10:46] <Auckland_Pig> deadcat: ooooo yes.... thank you
[10:46] <achandra> lol
[10:46] <calamari> deadcat: but it apparently didn't stop whatever it was doing with the disk
[10:46] <Hexidigital_> achandra:: what do you mean?? i do that all the time !  :)
[10:46] <achandra> heh
[10:47] <ikor> deadcat: actually you can install cron from cygwin :)
[10:47] <deadcat> ikor: i dont know
[10:47] <achandra> egad: the  source will likely give us a different result.. if you want we can try it..
[10:47] <Ademan_> dpkg and apt-get both trip up on "../../packages.c" line 191... anyone familiar with this problem?
[10:47] <calamari> I see a bunch of [pdflush]  tasks.. wonder if they are related.. there is no man page
[10:48] <zcat[1] > calamari: I'd suggest ps -ax  and look for something that looks like gnome-copy and kill the PID of that..
[10:48] <Auckland_Pig> lazy ubotu....
[10:48] <Auckland_Pig> ubotu are you lazy
[10:48] <ubotu> Auckland_Pig: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[10:48] <achandra> egad: are you game..or?
[10:48] <Auckland_Pig> !cron
[10:48] <ubotu> methinks cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. There is a HOW-TO located at http://www.tech-geeks.org/contrib/mdrone/cron&crontab-howto.htm
[10:49] <zcat[1] > !anacron
[10:49] <ubotu> My cat's name is Mittens! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, zcat[1] 
[10:49] <Hexidigital_> !cron
[10:49] <calamari> zcat[1] : thanks, pgrep doesn't seem to find either gnome-copy or copy
[10:49] <Hexidigital_> oh
[10:49] <calamari> perhaps I should just reboot
[10:49] <deadcat> ya
[10:49] <calamari> weird bug.. probably hardware related
[10:50] <zcat[1] > /etc/init.d/gdm restart or ctrl-alt-backspace.. when you kill yourlogin it should kill all the children too.
[10:50] <r0xoR> where are the iptables rule files?
[10:50] <r0xoR> i.e. where i can place my "allow" and "deny" declarations?
[10:50] <egad> achandra: source is what i was using before
[10:51] <egad> achandra: well you mean sourceforge ndis correct?
[10:51] <deadcat> r0xoR: make it yourself. dont think there is such file
[10:51] <zcat[1] > speaking of children, pstree might be more enlightening..
[10:51] <r0xoR> deadcat, ahhh, do you know what the default one is? is there a default?
[10:51] <deadcat> r0xoR: nope.
[10:51] <achandra> egad: okay...i found some more stuff.
[10:52] <deadcat> r0xoR: i dont think there is a default firewall rules
[10:52] <achandra> egad: Open the networking configuration tool System --> Administration --> Networking
[10:52] <deadcat> r0xoR: does iptables -v -L -n show anything?
[10:53] <egad> achandra: uhmm i just did this.. http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=938505&postcount=15 i bet i hosed it even mroe now by blacklisting ndis :c/
[10:53] <achandra> egad: did you get that?
[10:53] <r0xoR> ahh, does iptables need kernel support?
[10:53] <deadcat> r0xoR: yes
[10:53] <r0xoR> ok
[10:53] <r0xoR> i'll have to recompile then
[10:53] <achandra> egad: what did you??
[10:53] <r0xoR> tha's coo'
[10:53] <egad> achandra: all the commands in that post
[10:54] <Ng> r0xoR: netfilter is available in the default ubuntu kernels, you shouldn't need to recompile
[10:54] <Hexidigital_> egad:: sudo apt-get remove ndiswrapper-utils
[10:54] <achandra> see private message
[10:54] <spikeb> damn it
[10:54] <Hexidigital_> and use bcm43
[10:54] <spikeb> Hexidigital_:  that :: stuff makes me think i'm reading perl at first
[10:54] <Hexidigital_> :)
[10:54] <jain> Hi
[10:54] <Hexidigital_> i'm studying perl, spikeb
[10:54] <achandra> egad: go to private message and i have instructions there...
[10:55] <achandra> i just pulled it up..
[10:55] <egad> achandra: what pm? dont have any yet
[10:55] <Hexidigital_> egad:: are you registered?
[10:55] <egad> Hexidigital_: did that .. now where is bcm43?
[10:55] <Hexidigital_> on freenode?
[10:56] <egad> Hexidigital: nope
[10:56] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell egad about register
[10:56] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell egad about bcm43xx
[10:56] <Hexidigital_> yeah, guess that won't work
[10:56] <Hexidigital_> !register
[10:56] <ubotu> Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[10:56] <Hexidigital_> !bcm43xx
[10:56] <ubotu> To use your broadcom or airport extreme card, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx for info and firmware.
[10:57] <achandra> egad: we'll work on it in here..
[10:57] <egad> ok registered
[10:59] <Hexidigital_> one more smoke, then bedtime for me
[10:59] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell egad about bcm43xx
[10:59] <Hexidigital_> egad:: follow those directions
[10:59] <achandra> pulled up the same ones..yep..
[11:02] <Hexidigital_> nite fellow ubuntu-ers
[11:02] <Unenvarjo> good morning :)
[11:06] <Schalken> hi!
[11:06] <selinium> How can you find out what is using a particular resource   /dev/dsp
[11:06] <deadcat> selinium: fuser -v /dev/dsp
[11:07] <jain> Hi
[11:07] <selinium> deadcat: Cheers!
[11:07] <jain> I need some help
[11:07] <deadcat> jain: give me a min. i am reading your mind as we speak
[11:07] <jain> I am having problems with hibernating and switch user
[11:07] <jain> with fglrx
[11:08] <jain> the screen doesnot resume
[11:08] <jain> in hibernate case
[11:08] <jain> and for switching user the computer just freezes when I try
[11:09] <philc> I just plugged in a usb gamepad. What device should it be?
[11:09] <jain> Anyone?
[11:09] <egad> jain: i could be wrong but i dont believe fglrx supports hibernating ??
[11:09] <r0xoR> Mg, heheh... maybe *you* shouldn't have to recompile
[11:09] <smack> hey dudes I just upgraded to dapper and when my desktop comes up my gnome-panel is pure white for a second before my theme applies.
[11:09] <nhaines> I don't think you can hibernate with fglrx at all.
[11:10] <jain> egad: Is it so?
[11:10] <r0xoR> Mg, but i've got a custom compiled kernel, so yes, i have to recompile
[11:10] <jain> it worked in FC5 when i was using it
[11:10] <H080J03> i am running a live cd and my computer is going really really slow
[11:10] <jain> I can hibernate, problem with resuming at last step, it shows the mouse pointer
[11:10] <jain> and then it hangs
[11:11] <deadcat> H080J03: its live cd. ofcourse its slow
[11:11] <thoreauputic> H080J03: and this surprises you?
[11:11] <H080J03> what can i do to speed it up
[11:11] <H080J03> no
[11:11] <Ng> r0xoR: *N*g. and why do you?
[11:11] <H080J03> it is super slow
[11:11] <deadcat> load them all into memory
[11:11] <deadcat> H080J03: your cdrom sucks then
[11:11] <r0xoR> oh right
[11:11] <r0xoR> Ng
[11:11] <H080J03> i can type faster then the words apaer
[11:11] <Ng> H080J03: you could check DMA is enabled on the CD drive
[11:12] <r0xoR> Ng, three closed source drivers... two nvidia, one for my sound card
[11:12] <Ng> but that's unlikely to be slowing your typing
[11:12] <r0xoR> kinda sucks but oh well
[11:12] <thoreauputic> H080J03: what are the specs of yourmachine? CPU? RAM?
[11:12] <egad> jain: ati?
[11:12] <H080J03> what is DMS
[11:13] <Ng> r0xoR: no way of building them against the default kernel?
[11:13] <jain> egad: with ati things are OK
[11:13] <H080J03> p4 768 ram
[11:13] <r0xoR> H080J03, http://www.hightechbuzzwords.com/
[11:13] <thoreauputic> H080J03: DMA = Direct Memory Access
[11:13] <H080J03> i am not even gonna try going there
[11:13] <H080J03> oh ok
[11:13] <r0xoR> Mg, hahahah... um, no
[11:13] <Ng> H080J03: I'm tempted to suggest that the live CD is using a slow, but compatible graphics card driver. what kind of card do you have?
[11:13] <r0xoR> dang... Ng, sorry
[11:13] <Ng> r0xoR: *N*! and that surprises me, especially the nvidia ones
[11:13] <thoreauputic> H080J03: a p4 should handle a live CD easily with that much ram
[11:13] <jain> but i wand 3D acceleration
[11:14] <H080J03> Nvida geForce 5200
[11:14] <r0xoR> Ng, meh, it's not the nvidia ones that matter
[11:14] <r0xoR> anyway
[11:14] <H080J03> yea that is what i am thinkin
[11:14] <tubbie> H080J03, it is supported
[11:14] <egad> jain: right.. the ati drivers support hibernating.. fglrx does not
[11:14] <Ng> H080J03: after you've installed properly, come back here and ask about getting the nvidia drivers installed, should help things :)
[11:15] <H080J03> i know how to install the drivers and stuff
[11:15] <egad> jain: its a trade off.. either 3d support or hibernation support
[11:15] <thoreauputic> H080J03: run "top" in a terminal to see what's eating your resources
[11:15] <H080J03> but i can't work with the live CD being this slow
[11:15] <tubbie> H080J03, don't expect a very fast system froma  livecd
[11:15] <jain> egad: hmm, I was using fedora core 5 before, and it worked there. I thoght it would work in ubuntu too
[11:15] <H080J03> yea i expect one faster then the one i am in
[11:16] <H080J03> it feels like windows ME
[11:16] <thoreauputic> H080J03: kill whatever process is slowing you down - but live CDs are never fast
[11:16] <tubbie> H080J03, what's your hardware spec?
[11:16] <egad> jain: query the ubuntuforums.org site.. I recall seeing something about this on there recently..
[11:16] <jain> egad: though fglrx was not working with previous version of fedora
[11:16] <H080J03> p4 2.5ghz768ram
[11:16] <jain> egad: Okay
[11:16] <tubbie> H080J03, demonoid/
[11:16] <tubbie> ?
[11:16] <Rene_J> hi, i am using the filer gentoo under ubuntu. sadly copying files does not work anymore. i guess the reason are utf filenames (possible?)
[11:17] <H080J03> sup tubbie
[11:17] <thoreauputic> Rene_J: possible - I don't knowif gentoo supports utf-8
[11:17] <tubbie> H080J03, why are you not in #demonoid?
[11:18] <H080J03> cuz my computer is to slow to open up any more channles
[11:18] <H080J03> in fact i have typed this and sent it to you but i can't see it
[11:18] <tubbie> so slow?
[11:18] <Rene_J> is it even possible if i copy filenames that dont contain any special characters?
[11:18] <tubbie> H080J03, I can fix it for you if you sned it to me
[11:18] <H080J03> really really slow like ME slow
[11:19] <tubbie> send*
[11:19] <tubbie> lol
[11:19] <thoreauputic> Rene_J: don't know - I haven't used gentoo filer for years
[11:19] <tubbie> H080J03, do you have a free partition?
[11:19] <H080J03> yea
[11:20] <H080J03> i have a free hard drive

[11:25] <thoreauputic> Ademan: looking
[11:25] <Ademan_> it really doesnt seem like it should have anythign to do with my sources
[11:25] <javiolo> is there any way to uninstall evolution ?
[11:26] <javiolo> thoreaputic thanks! Im downloading right now
[11:26] <jain> A small question
[11:26] <jain> If I don't want my computer to get locked every time I resume from hibernate what should I do?
[11:26] <liquidindian> If I use a live CD on a windows machine, can I access NTFS drive?
[11:26] <nhaines> javiolo, I prefer Thunderbird.  I don't recommend uninstalling evolution, though.
[11:26] <liquidindian> Not to write, just to read.
[11:26] <nhaines> liquidindian, yes you can, but only read-only.
[11:26] <enquest> how do I erase a RW cd in Gnome?
[11:27] <liquidindian> nhaines so there's a possibilty I could use it to rescue his data?
=== ubuntu is now known as H080J03
[11:27] <thoreauputic> Ademan: I suggest you remove the us.fromall lines, and addthe word multiverseat the end of all universe lines, update and try again
[11:27] <H080J03> i lied
[11:27] <javiolo> nhaines I need a fast email client
[11:27] <nhaines> liquidindian, It is a possibility, yes.
[11:27] <H080J03> i didn't bust out with the gentoo CD i lost it
[11:27] <Ademan_> apt-get --update ?
[11:27] <thoreauputic> Ademan: it might be an issue with trhe us. archive
[11:27] <Doat> How can i access my Nokia mobile phone's memory with ubuntu? Nothing happens when i plug it in with an USB cable.
[11:27] <nhaines> javiolo, Thunderbird is fast enuogh for me, but it's also cross-platform, which is why I use it.
[11:28] <thoreauputic> Ademan: sudo apt-get update
[11:28] <H080J03> but i put the CD in my other CD rom drive that has DMA
[11:28] <liquidindian> nhaines, I hope I can come across as some techie wizard if it works :)
[11:28] <nhaines> liquidindian, Use the System>Help menu, and then try the Ubuntu Starter Guide for the appropriate commands to mount the NTFS partition.  Then you can burn using the integrated Gnome CD creater or whatever.  ;)
[11:28] <H080J03> with a live CD, can i eject the disk and insert a blank disc to burn
[11:28] <tubbie> H080J03, why don't u istall it?
[11:28] <H080J03> cuz
[11:29] <javiolo> nhaines Im on a macmini with 256 mb of RAM
[11:29] <H080J03> i have no install disk
[11:29] <tubbie> download it then ;)
[11:29] <H080J03> i was gonna go with drapper
[11:29] <thoreauputic> Ademan: you might wantto uncomment the universe security lines as well
[11:29] <liquidindian> nhaines, bunging the stuff on my USB hard drive should work too, yes?
=== dartmolx is now known as world
[11:29] <H080J03> but i am having problems downloading it with a live CD
[11:29] <javiolo> nhaines did evolution worked good to you ? cos sometimes takes too much to do simple things...
[11:29] <nhaines> liquidindian, yes, just as well.  Just make sure to right-click and eject the icon for the USB drive before disconnecting it!
[11:29] <Ademan_> i wouldnt have ANY sources then...
[11:30] <nhaines> javiolo, I haven't used evolution.
[11:30] <H080J03> i have the live CD in my CD burner
[11:30] <thoreauputic> Ademan: umm - uncomment means remove the #
[11:30] <H080J03> and this is gonna be a prob
[11:30] <Ademan_> lol
[11:30] <Ademan_> sorry
[11:30] <liquidindian> nhaines, got it.
[11:30] <Ademan_> i'm watching platoon at the same time

[11:30] <thoreauputic> :)
[11:30] <tubbie> H080J03, got 2 cdrom there?
[11:30] <Ademan_> understand how what works?
[11:30] <heidrich> hi!
[11:30] <H080J03> yea
[11:30] <heidrich> any tool to edit fstab?
[11:30] <H080J03> one burns and one don't
[11:31] <tubbie> us e the don't one to boot up
[11:31] <thoreauputic> Ademan: stop watching platoon and concentrate onthe task at hand :D
[11:31] <H080J03> the one that don't makes the live CD run like Windows ME
[11:31] <Ademan_> hehe
[11:31] <heidrich> not editors, thats ok for me, but not perfect for dummies.
[11:31] <Ademan_> i just read uncomment as comment thats all
[11:31] <tubbie> H080J03, ok, but you can download the cd now
[11:31] <tubbie> and then reboot to burn it
[11:31] <nhaines> heidrich, there's an application under System>Administration.  Disks, maybe.
[11:31] <heidrich> negativ!!
[11:31] <thoreauputic> Ademan: You need to up your IQ a few points - I suggest listening to Mozart
[11:31] <heidrich> can not set mount options.
[11:32] <thoreauputic> ;P
[11:32] <H080J03> yea i am downloading it, but how i am i gonna burn it?
[11:32] <tubbie> H080J03, use gnomebaker
[11:32] <H080J03> umm
[11:32] <H080J03> my live CD is in my Cd burner
[11:33] <petrik> What is the best file format to go for when formatting a drive?
[11:33] <Ademan_> ok so now the only sources i have enabled are the security ones
[11:33] <H080J03> petrik: go with ext3
[11:33] <thoreauputic> H080J03: downloading an ISO with a live CD won't work unless you save it to your hard disk or have insane amounts of RAM
[11:33] <H080J03> oh
[11:33] <tubbie> H080J03, after you finsihed downloading, reboot so you can use your cd burner
[11:34] <dli> petrik, there's no such obivious "best" :)
[11:34] <heidrich> anyone using ntfs for read/write?
[11:34] <thoreauputic> H080J03: live CDs use a ramdisk
[11:34] <H080J03> hey tubbie if i reboot the download goes away
[11:34] <H080J03> grr
[11:34] <tubbie> H080J03, no, you can put it on your HD
[11:34] <thoreauputic> H080J03: correct
[11:34] <H080J03> sooo
[11:34] <tubbie> just ermount your hd with rw
[11:34] <H080J03> i am i gonna install an OS?
[11:34] <tubbie> remount
[11:34] <heidrich> install creates defauilts option, which is ro, and unreadable for users!
[11:34] <H080J03> hmm
[11:34] <Doat> How can i access my Nokia mobile phone's memory with ubuntu? Nothing happens when i plug it in with an USB cable.
[11:35] <petrik> (Well what is the difference between them all?)  then when I have done that how can I get some of my stuff moved to the new drive? eg /home
[11:35] <heidrich> sudo remount is ok for a single time.
[11:35] <klerfayt> will the nvidia-glx package going to be updated to the latest?
[11:35] <dli> petrik, you can simply, " cp -a " the folders
[11:35] <Mortal`> Is there a command to set the contents of the clipboard?
[11:35] <nhaines> klerfayt, if it hasn't been done yet, it surely won't be done before October!
[11:36] <spikeb> dapper froze on upstream versioning a while ago
[11:36] <klerfayt> nhaines: why? are you sure about dapper?
[11:36] <nhaines> klerfayt, Dapper comes out in a week.  There won't be any major changes now.
[11:37] <klerfayt> well on then I think I'll use "nv" then
[11:37] <klerfayt> lol
[11:37] <klerfayt> lot's of "then"s
[11:37] <nhaines> klerfayt, the best thing then to do is to check the forums for the XGl repository someone made.  :)
[11:37] <tubbie> H080J03, how are youdownloading the file?
[11:37] <nhaines> It has frequent updates for dapper.
[11:37] <H080J03> no
[11:37] <H080J03> i stoped it
[11:38] <H080J03> till i get my HD mounted
[11:38] <tubbie> H080J03, god. now just mount your HD first
[11:38] <klerfayt> err I'm talking about nvidia driver
[11:38] <klerfayt> not xgl
[11:38] <Mortal`> Is there a command to set the contents of the clipboard?
[11:38] <nhaines> Oh!  I misunderstood.  Yeah, then you'll have to compile yourself or use nv.
[11:39] <klerfayt> nhaines: why? cause nvidia driver won't be updated to the latest?
[11:39] <javiolo> nhaines thanks thunderbird works great!
[11:40] <thoreauputic> ompaul: ping?
[11:40] <nhaines> klerfayt, right. Whatever's in dapper now is going to be in 6.06 on Thursday.
[11:40] <nhaines> javiolo, I'm glad you like it.  :)
[11:41] <ompaul> thoreauputic, pong
[11:42] <rick_> does anyone know how i can get my xfire for gaim actually 'in gaim?
[11:42] <Doat> How can i access my Nokia mobile phone's memory with ubuntu? Nothing happens when i plug it in with an USB cable.
[11:42] <petrik> What other directories would be good to move? Want to make it like I had under M$ OS seperated from programs and data seperate again. Though I beleive linux works in an entirely different way
[11:44] <Hmmmm> hi guys, i have an amd geode based device. I can't get ubuntu to boot on it. Any idea how to get ubuntu install on it?
[11:44] <beta_m> i have an ubuntu machine and after i've put 2 extra harddrives in it stopped booting. It comes to "Uncompressing kernel. OK. Booting kernel" and freezes. Live CD works fine. I didn't change the place of the boot partition (it was and still is hda1).
[11:44] <H080J03> k
[11:45] <H080J03> mounted the hard drive and now i am downloading
[11:45] <petrik> When you install software in linux does it wind it in to the operating system like it does in windoze
[11:45] <beta_m> petrik, what are you using to install?
[11:45] <onderhoudsman> hallo
[11:46] <onderhoudsman> is er iemand on line???
[11:46] <H080J03> hallo
[11:46] <beta_m> if it's the programme's personal install, you don't know what it's doing. But if you are using package mannager, then you can always undo.
[11:46] <nhaines> Ja, wir sind online.  :)
[11:46] <onderhoudsman> praat u nederland???
[11:46] <nhaines> Nein, ich spreche nur auf Englisch und auf Deutsch.
[11:46] <onderhoudsman> ok englisch
[11:47] <tubbie> H080J03, :)
[11:47] <onderhoudsman> dus u talk englisch
[11:47] <H080J03> tubbie
[11:47] <nhaines> Would be best.  :)
[11:47] <H080J03> oh ok
[11:47] <petrik> Well under windoze I started formatting in partitions to safeguard against windoze going belly up. OS on one partition, installed software on another, data on yet another
[11:47] <tubbie> H080J03, I'm with you
[11:47] <ompaul> !de
[11:47] <beta_m> so does anybody have any idea about what happened to my machine?

[11:47] <ubotu> Op #ubuntu-nl staat de koffie al voor je klaar.
[11:47] <tubbie> H080J03, how are you downlaoding the file?
[11:47] <H080J03> wget
[11:48] <tubbie> don't forget to tell ffoc to save it on your HD
[11:48] <H080J03> that is how
[11:48] <tubbie> oh, :)
[11:48] <petrik> Having the installed software on a seperate partition was really not much use as it integrated it's files into windoze anyhow
[11:48] <petrik> I'm still trying figure out how to install stuff
[11:48] <nhaines> I don't run runescape, sorry.
[11:49] <beta_m> petrik:  what are you talking about? what has integrated itself into windows?
[11:49] <H080J03> hey petrik you install stuff with packages
[11:49] <nhaines> petrik: to install anything, either use System>Administration>Synaptic, or use Applications>Add Applications
[11:50] <H080J03> or download a .deb of the file you want to install
[11:50] <petrik> some I done with the inbuilt pakage manager and others with ubuntu .deb packages
[11:50] <H080J03> good
[11:50] <H080J03> for other stuff you need to complie it
[11:50] <H080J03> which is not hard at all
=== banjo is now known as ert9erjkll
[11:51] <H080J03> just unzip the source and run the config file
[11:51] <H080J03> and the config file will tell you everything you need to get and do to comple it
[11:51] <petrik> there is a driver for which I have only been able to download source and I don't know how to compile it. Tried to follow some instuctions but did not work failing all the time
[11:52] <H080J03> open bash in the directory of the thing you want to install
[11:52] <H080J03> and then run ./config
[11:53] <H080J03> and it will run into errors, probly saying you need stuff like gcc
[11:53] <H080J03> but everything it says you need can be found in the packge manger
[11:54] <petrik> Beta: nothing is intrigating with windows. Was reffering to how windoze works and how I had it set up. (not anymore now I'm on linux)
[11:54] <H080J03> good thing your on linux 2
[11:54] <petrik> Can I do a dump of my attempt here?
[11:55] <H080J03> umm
[11:55] <H080J03> an attempt of what?
[11:55] <Ng> petrik: use a pastebin
[11:55] <Ng> !tell petrik about pastebin
[11:57] <beta_m> OK, i'm sorry for repeating some of the stuff. I have an ubuntu machine with 2.6.12-10 686-smp kernel, it was working fine until i've added some extra harddrives to it. And now right after it starts loading the kernel, the machine freezes. What can be the cause of that. I need at least an idea or something, i don't want to reinstall the whole thing.
[11:57] <beta_m> and i almost forgot, live CD works.
[11:57] <beta_m> so it's nothing wrong with the machine itself
[11:57] <ompaul> H080J03, your not accurate in your help for ubuntu users :-)
[11:58] <thoreauputic> H080J03: please be sure before yougive advice :0
[11:58] <nhaines> beta_m, make sure you didn't move the drive that has Ubuntu installed on it or change its jumper settings..

[11:58] <banjo_rrte> hi, ive got a problem upgrading to breezy on a dialup line.  I download 700+Mb (3 days) and then when that download fails it *deletes* all the packages - forcing me to download them all over again.  I tried with apt-get -d dist-upgrade, but it still deletes all my downloaded debs, ouch, help?
[11:58] <H080J03> almost
[11:58] <H080J03> that is the magic word
[11:59] <H080J03> i find lots of things not in the repos
[11:59] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig, installing package "ssh" does also install sshd.
[11:59] <H080J03> like XGL
[11:59] <H080J03> but XGL is in the new repos
[11:59] <achandra> hello. my resolution didnt come up right when i installed dapper. and dropped to init 3. can someone help out with how to get x working.
[11:59] <Auckland_Pig> nhaines: how do i start ssh server during booting?
[11:59] <ompaul> XGL well that is a dapper thing not a breezy thing
[11:59] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig, install ssh.
[11:59] <H080J03> yea
[11:59] <petrik> Where in Auckland AP?
[11:59] <H080J03> and there are other things
[11:59] <Auckland_Pig> petrik: northshore
[12:00] <H080J03> i don't think wine is in there
[12:00] <ompaul> H080J03, it is a bit like asking about 2.14 gnome for breezy this is a timed release
[12:00] <Auckland_Pig> nhaines: but will ssh server always start on boot?
[12:00] <petrik> Want to come over and help here?
[12:00] <thoreauputic> Auckland_Pig: yes
[12:00] <beta_m> H080J03:  i think wine is there
[12:00] <Auckland_Pig> oh thanks
[12:00] <H080J03> hm
[12:00] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig, yes, until you later disable it.  You don't even have to reboot after you install ssh.  :)
[12:00] <beta_m> but you have to enable some repository for it
[12:00] <Auckland_Pig> nhaines: thanks :)
[12:00] <thoreauputic> Auckland_Pig: when you install it it makes the start up scripts
[12:00] <H080J03> i always downloaded the package from source forge
[12:01] <Auckland_Pig> petrik: where you from?
[12:01] <achandra> how do i configure X.. I got dropped to shell..when installing dapper.??
[12:01] <tubbie> H080J03, it won't make a big difference in performance if u compile form source
[12:01] <tubbie> just a waste of ti me
[12:01] <thoreauputic> H080J03: wine is in the repos
[12:01] <ompaul> H080J03, wine is in the repo

[12:03] <nhaines> GnarusLeo, no, Ubuntu 6.06 LTS comes out on Thursday, 1 June 2006.

[12:03] <H080J03> it is very hard to think
[12:03] <[nige] > its not longer on my system. any ideas?
[12:03] <red_> hello
[12:04] <thoreauputic> petrik: don't listen to H080J03 - he's having a bad hair day
[12:04] <H080J03> yea
[12:04] <petrik> same thing happens there
[12:04] <H080J03> he is right
[12:04] <H080J03> i am going dumb
[12:04] <H080J03> oh yea!!
[12:04] <ompaul> H080J03, cease while your ahead
[12:04] <H080J03> now i am smart with this new ram
[12:04] <tubbie> H080J03, you need to replace your celeron too
[12:05] <tubbie> Pecisk, read readme
[12:05] <_nano_> I don't see any entries regarding my usb drive in the fstab file, but it still gets mounted when I plug it in...how is it so?
[12:05] <tubbie> petrik, ^^
[12:05] <gr8rahul> _nano_ .hotpluggin ..
[12:05] <kholerabbi> hey, how do I install the Gaim Beta 3 on ubuntu 5.20?
[12:06] <thoreauputic> tubbie: I think it mustbe a 486 ;)
[12:06] <e1ko> hello
[12:06] <marlijs> nano take a look at the /etc/mtab
[12:06] <tubbie> :)
[12:06] <_nano_> marlijs, but mtab only keeps tab of already mounted files
[12:06] <_nano_> gr8rahul, where is that file located?
[12:06] <e1ko> I need to execute 1 script every time my ip is changed via dhcp, where should I put this script, please?
[12:07] <gr8rahul> /etc/hotplug
[12:07] <marlijs> nano, so what do you want to see the?
[12:07] <petrik> I'm doing something wrong. Opened terminal. Went to the folder. Did ./configure and got error the package is spca5xx-20060501
[12:07] <_nano_> marlijs, the problem is my usb drive is not automounted if it's already connected before booting....
[12:07] <GnarusLeo> and will it be easy to update my distro to the 1.juny release?
[12:07] <zcat[1] > apparently vista is going to be delayed a little more.. hahaha!
[12:08] <_nano_> marlijs, i have some script that need access to the usb drive once I log in...hence i need to automount it..
[12:08] <tubbie> old news
[12:08] <GnarusLeo> nhaines, will it be easy to update to the 1.juny release? Im not sure I want to reinstall the whole thing
[12:08] <tubbie> H080J03, still downloading?
[12:08] <tubbie> H080J03, are you pip`?
[12:08] <H080J03> yea
[12:09] <H080J03> i am still downloading
[12:09] <zcat[1] > yeah, and entirely predictable.. anyone taking bets on when it will actually be out? I guess all the people who predicted mid 2004 had better pay up already :)
[12:09] <marlijs> nano, I am not shure, but is you see your usbflash in /etc/mtab - then copy it to fstab and it should mount it on startup
[12:09] <H080J03> i am searching google for things not in ubuntus repos
[12:09] <nhaines> GnarusLeo, it will be very simple.  Update Manager will notify you with an "upgrade" button.
[12:09] <GnarusLeo> even in kubuntu?
[12:09] <beta_m> ok, this doesn't make sense. i can boot with live CD, but Install CD also freezes after attempting to boot up the kernel
[12:09] <achandra> basic question...5.1.0 is the stable version and dapper is not or?
[12:09] <tubbie> I hope the will pussh it back to end 2007!
[12:10] <tubbie> they*
[12:10] <Lozzy`> hey, I was thinking of switching to Ubuntu looking at the new review of 6.06 in LFX. My only concern is support for my beloved iPod.
[12:10] <Lozzy`> I'm using Windows atm, and all my music is in AAC.
[12:10] <_nano_> marlijs, i was thinking of doing that, i was only wondering if that would conflict with some other process...since it gets mounted without any entry in the fstab
[12:10] <zcat[1] > 'another few weeks' - that would be about April or May, right?
[12:10] <nhaines> GnarusLeo, yes, the KDE update manger should do it too.
[12:10] <tubbie> Lozzy`, it should work
[12:10] <GnarusLeo> ok, sweet, thanks nhaines  :)
[12:10] <Lozzy`> Justworktm?
[12:11] <e1ko> should I put my script into /etc/hotplug/net.ifup?
[12:11] <nhaines> You're welcome.  :)  Also, just downloading the CD and putting it in your computer the first time while Kubuntu is running should make it ask if you want to upgrade.  :)  But using the update tool should be better--they wrote a program specially for upgrading.
[12:11] <zcat[1] > Lozzy`: put Linux on your ipod, then it can play ogg's
[12:12] <POVaddct> Lozzy`: i use my iPod nano with retune (python script, mp3 only). there is also gtkpod, which has a gui.
[12:12] <marlijs> nano. there is only one way to find out :), if something goes wrong - you van comment it out
[12:12] <_nano_> marlijs, right on :) ..trying that out :D
[12:13] <Lozzy`> My iPod can play oggs?
[12:13] <Lozzy`> With linux?
[12:13] <Determinist> !w32codecs
[12:13] <ubotu> a compilation of binary win32 A/V codecs for many popular non-free formats. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for 64-bit systems see http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=54399
[12:13] <zcat[1] > there's a port of mklinux for the ipod, yes. But I'd probably just stick with mp3's myself...
[12:13] <tubbie> Lozzy`,  he says yo can put Linux on your ipod
[12:14] <tubbie> it is called Ipod linux I think
[12:14] <Lozzy`> Cool
[12:14] <Lozzy`> I imagine I could just port all my AACs to mp3s
[12:14] <GnarusLeo> I get this error when I try to get the newest amarok (have added the new rep ot sources.list) The following packages have been kept back:
[12:14] <GnarusLeo>   amarok amarok-engines amarok-xine krita libxine1c2 update-manager
[12:14] <zcat[1] > not sure, you might have to burn them to cd and rip them again if they're drm'ed
[12:15] <kholerabbi> How do I know warty hoary breezy or dapper?
[12:15] <nhaines> Rockbox is supposed to be pretty nice with iPods.  It's also easy to revert back to factory firmware.
[12:15] <BazziR> GnarusLeo: do a dist-upgrade
[12:15] <GnarusLeo> BazziR, how?
[12:15] <spikeb> rockbox is a bit unstable
[12:15] <BazziR> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:15] <petrik> Ok I put it in paste bin
[12:15] <GnarusLeo> ah :) Thanks
[12:16] <Lozzy`> looking at rockbox site now
[12:17] <Lozzy`> what other alternatives are there?
[12:17] <Blippe> rockbox rox
[12:17] <spikeb> rockbox and ipodlinux are the only two i know of
[12:17] <petrik> I notice when someone replies to me it comes up in red in this irc. How does that work?
[12:18] <gr8rahul> petrik .. clour can be set
=== prgrmr_ is now known as prgrmr
[12:18] <gr8rahul> hi
[12:19] <nhaines> petrik, if your name is on a line, it's red, that's all.  :)
[12:20] <GnarusLeo> BazziR, I did the upgrade .. but still: The following packages have been kept back:
[12:20] <GnarusLeo>   amarok amarok-engines amarok-xine
[12:20] <achandra> besides manually configuring the xf86  file is there a tool from command line to configure X or autodetect..my X  is not coming up..
[12:20] <BazziR> GnarusLeo: dist-upgrade shouldn't keep anything back
[12:20] <GnarusLeo> hm
[12:21] <nhaines> GnarusLeo, if that doesn't work, run Synaptic and tell it to "mark all upgrades."
[12:21] <marlijs> GnarusLeo, try apt-get install amarok amarok-engines
[12:21] <petrik> Ok. It makes it a lot easier to follow
[12:21] <Donvinzk> anyone using scilab here ?
[12:21] <GnarusLeo> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[12:21] <GnarusLeo>   amarok: Depends: libexscalibar1 but it is not going to be installed
[12:21] <viper12> Is anyone currently testing tseliot's nvidia scripts?  just used it (testing version for dapper 6.06) and it works...until you reboot.  then I get an api mismatch. (7174).
[12:21] <BazziR> a-ha :)
[12:22] <GnarusLeo> BazziR :)
[12:22] <BazziR> GnarusLeo: you on breezy?
[12:22] <GnarusLeo> yes
[12:22] <BazziR> and which version of amarok do you try to install?
[12:22] <GnarusLeo> 4.1
[12:22] <BazziR> won't work
[12:22] <BazziR> upgrade to dapper for amarok 1.4
[12:22] <GnarusLeo> sorry, 1.4
[12:23] <GnarusLeo> oh .. ok, how do I update to dapper?
[12:23] <GnarusLeo> using kubuntu
[12:23] <BazziR> wait a week for the final
[12:23] <BazziR> then replace any breezy in your sources.list to dapper
[12:23] <GnarusLeo> 1.june? :) Ok .. I will, thanks bazzir
[12:23] <BazziR> do a dist-upgrade and be done :)

[12:24] <petrik> So as you get more programs how can you keep hold of them all? Once they are installed how can you get a copy on disk for when you require a reformat or get a new PC?
[12:24] <pc14> si
[12:24] <pc14> bonjuor
[12:25] <nhaines> GnarusLeo, no, don't change anything in your sources.list.  You'll be offered the choice to upgrade as soon as Ubuntu 6.06 LTS is released.

[12:27] <petrik> BazziR, Yeah but where do you get it from. What if you get something you are relying on and the repos no longer has it. I prefer to have things tangible in my house. Not on some server where it may or may not be there when I next need it.
[12:28] <nhaines> Okay, it's bedtime for me.  Take care, everyone.  :)

[12:33] <petrik> How do get replies from the paste bin? Do you go to the paste bin or does it send you email?
[12:34] <petrik> Hey another one from New Zealand
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[12:36] <Auckland_Pig> petrik: you just post the link to the paste bin and people visit it.... not sure if any paste bin actually emails it...
[12:36] <KillerKiwi2006> ?
[12:38] <petrik> Auckland_Pig, so how do you get a responce to your query if it is looked at and you're not on irc at the time?
[12:39] <Auckland_Pig> you must be in IRC petrik

[12:41] <Corey> Hey guys, i just downloaded crossover office and it was a .rar file and in the .rar file are heaps of .zip files is there a special way of auto-installing all of those files ?
[12:42] <Corey> Hey guys, i just downloaded crossover office and it was a .rar file and in the .rar file are heaps of .zip files is there a special way of auto-installing all of those files ?
[12:43] <Corey> ??
[12:44] <KillerKiwi2006> no idea i use stright wine
[12:44] <Corey> yeah
[12:44] <Corey> Im trying to get dreamweaver 8 workig
[12:44] <Corey> but it says please re-install dreamweaver
[12:44] <petrik> Ok another dumb noob question. How can you find out what kernel you have?
[12:44] <Corey> linux :P
[12:44] <POVaddct> petrik: cat /proc/version
[12:44] <Corey> how can i get dreamweaver 8 working ?
[12:45] <KillerKiwi2006> is that MX ?
[12:45] <Corey> its 8
[12:45] <Corey> and there is peole that have it working
[12:45] <BazziR> Corey: why do you want to get it working :/ there are so many good alternatives
[12:46] <KillerKiwi2006> did you install it in wine or is it on another partition already?
[12:46] <ubuntu> s.a
[12:46] <ubuntu> hi
[12:46] <Corey> BazziR: yes unless there is a program that is almost replica of dreamod.weaver with css functtionality its no go
[12:46] <Corey> NVU was horrible.
=== ubuntu is now known as er
[12:46] <er> sd
[12:46] <BazziR> write by hand ;)
[12:46] <er> selam
[12:47] <Corey> BazziR: I don't want to im lazy and 8 has awseome css funtionality
[12:47] <BazziR> it was improved, yes, but I still don't consider it awesome
[12:47] <Subhuman> Corey, the closest free alt. to DW is NVU
[12:47] <petrik> there are stand alone css editors around
[12:48] <BazziR> OK so if you really want it then go for it.
[12:48] <Subhuman> if you dont like nvu well learn to use something else.
[12:48] <Corey> i want to use dreamweaver
[12:48] <BazziR> did you try wine before trying crossover office?
[12:48] <Corey> there is people using 8 via wine !
[12:48] <KillerKiwi2006> Corey : did you run the installer under wine?
[12:48] <BazziR> I suggest installing wine 0.9.13 and trying with that, that version works very well here
[12:49] <Corey> no it wouldnt let me, i had to go to my windows machine
[12:49] <Corey> and move the files over
[12:49] <petrik> Years ago I was playing with redhat and used wine for lightwave - was slow but it worked
[12:49] <Corey> Im using wine for photoshop 7 now perfectly and itrs good cause i only 7 over cs and cs2
[12:49] <KillerKiwi2006> wine has its own registry, you need to run the installer to setup it up propaly
[12:49] <Corey> I did a lot of stuff like move common files and everything
[12:50] <Corey> i was following a tutorial
[12:50] <Corey> but it says when i start up dreamweaver "please re-install software"
[12:50] <MiniJames> has anyone managed to run cs2?
[12:50] <Diuegannnn> hi, is this the ubuntu channel??
[12:50] <Corey> yes it is
[12:50] <jay-ki1> yep
[12:50] <Diuegannnn> hi then :)
[12:50] <jay-ki1> he ya .. wats up
[12:50] <Diuegannnn> I am having a problem
[12:51] <petrik> I think wine was new at the time. Will be going down that path again soon to get lightwave working. The only M$ relient program I really need to run. Will be looking for an alternative to dreamweaver myself
[12:51] <jay-ki1> shoot up
[12:51] <Diuegannnn> its my first time with ubuntu
[12:51] <Mortal`> Is there a command to set the contents of the clipboard?
[12:51] <Diuegannnn> VERY nice program hehe
[12:51] <Diuegannnn> im on a live cd
[12:51] <Corey> Diuegannn this my third day of installed version its great :)
[12:51] <Corey> just trying to get the things i really need of windows like the adobe programs
[12:51] <Diuegannnn> aye, great
[12:51] <Corey> have the main one gonig
[12:51] <Diuegannnn> the thing is, I have XP installed in this comp
[12:52] <Corey> just need dreamweaver 8 and flash 8
[12:52] <Diuegannnn> and I dont know where to see my hard drives
[12:52] <Corey> i wiped and put ubuntu on :)
[12:52] <GnarusLeo> Doesnt "amsn" have the newer msn: "away message" ?
[12:52] <Corey> amsn is shit
[12:52] <Subhuman> Corey, if you need DW and Flash 8, why didnt you keep xp?
[12:52] <GnarusLeo> Corey, what do you use?
[12:52] <jay-ki1> Diuegannn:  what drives do you wanna see
[12:52] <Corey> subhuman: cause i like ubuntu
[12:52] <jay-ki1> Diuegannn: and from where
[12:52] <petrik> Must make Newtek create a linux version so I can go complete cold turkey on M$
[12:52] <BazziR> Corey: considered using vmware?
[12:52] <Diuegannnn> can someone tell me how can I access my hard drives?
[12:52] <Corey> vmware ? :O ?
[12:52] <Subhuman> !vmware
[12:52] <ubotu> Please check this out, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingVMWare adjusting kernel versions to your own, to get the number replace the numbers with " `uname -r" The ` is a Backtic
[12:53] <BazziR> yeah, virtualizing windows for dw8/flash8
[12:53] <GnarusLeo> What do you people use as replacement for msn in ubuntu?
[12:53] <Mortal`> Diuegannnn, Places (top of screen) > Computer
[12:53] <Corey> also guys i got flash player 8.5 working !
[12:53] <Subhuman> GnarusLeo, I use Mercury MEssenger
[12:53] <Mortal`> Diuegannnn, "Filesystem" is your Ubuntu drive
[12:53] <Subhuman> GnarusLeo, www.mercury.to
[12:53] <KillerKiwi2006> GnarusLeo: gaim 2
[12:53] <GnarusLeo> ok ..
[12:53] <petrik> Diuegannnn, system>administration>disks
[12:53] <Subhuman> it's java :( but itz pretty good
[12:53] <Mortal`> There's a Gaim 2?
[12:53] <Mortal`> :o
[12:53] <Subhuman> all the features of msn with some cool scripting too
[12:54] <Corey> so mecury is good eh ?
[12:54] <KillerKiwi2006> Mortal`:  yeah its nice
[12:54] <Mortal`> KillerKiwi2006, can I get it with apt?
[12:54] <KillerKiwi2006> its still beta3 though it wont make dapper
[12:54] <Corey> gaim 1 was shit !
[12:54] <Subhuman> I like it  just for the scripting and it supports webcam :D
[12:54] <Diuegannnn> but in filesystem I see a lot of linux drives, but how can I access my hard disk drives, the ones I use with windows, with all my archives
[12:55] <GnarusLeo> mercury looks sweet

[12:55] <Mortal`> Diuegannnn, isn't there some drives along the names hda1, hda2, hdd2?
[12:55] <Corey> KillerKiwi2006: is that mecury //
[12:56] <Mortal`> KillerKiwi2006, what do you mean by deb? I get command not found
[12:56] <Ng> Corey: please mind your language and really this isn't the place to spout such opinions ;)
[12:56] <Corey> oh sorry
[12:56] <KillerKiwi2006> Mortal`: Thats a repo, or you can just download the debs from the URL
[12:56] <Corey> alright to install a deb package you just type...
[12:56] <petrik> Mortal`, I've just installed aMSN. Have not tested it fully yet but on the surface of it I can not see where to use it with audio
[12:56] <Corey> dpkg -kxf file.deb
[12:56] <marlijs> Diuegannn, go to system => help => there is very good documentation

[12:58] <Corey> dapper sounds neat
[12:59] <Corey> how do you install .deb ?
[12:59] <Ng> sudo dpkg -i foo.deb
[12:59] <Corey> thanks mate
[12:59] <Diuegannnn> I can see my hard disk drives, hda, hdb and hdd, but if I go to filesystem /dev and try to double-click them, it says they cannot be displayed!
[12:59] <javiolo> just updated to dapper but now I cannot play mp3s
[01:00] <Diuegannnn> Can't I move archives, copy and delete, if they are formated in ntfs?
[01:00] <Corey> how do i use gaim2 ?
[01:00] <Ng> Diuegannnn: it's not safe to write to ntfs in linux at the moment, so they can only be mounted read-only
[01:00] <Corey> i just installed
[01:00] <Ng> !tell Diuegannnn about ntfs
[01:01] <marlijs> Diuegann, in this documentation you can find your answer howto access ntfs partitions

[01:04] <jain> everytime I try to use irattach there is a kernel panic
[01:04] <Corey> yeah

[01:09] <Ng> Corey: it's released a week today or there's a release candidate out later today. If you can wait a week then do, or if you want to test the RC, do, but be aware that there will still be some bugs
[01:09] <Corey> I downloaded the live cd
[01:09] <Corey> but it wouldnt work
[01:10] <Corey> maybe cause my cd was slightly scratched.
[01:10] <petrik> Can anyone make sense of what I just posted in the paste bin?
[01:11] <avalost> petrik: url?
[01:11] <Corey> what is the best programming editor besides scite ?
[01:11] <Subhuman> Corey, if your leet VIm is the way :P
[01:11] <Corey> VIm
[01:11] <Corey> ok
[01:11] <Corey> Im a php programmer
[01:11] <avalost> vim is complicated if you have never used it
[01:12] <Corey> lol
[01:12] <Subhuman> Corey, I suggest you check outr "vimtutor" first. serious.
[01:12] <avalost> Corey: use qanta, bluefish or screem
[01:12] <Corey> i liked notepad ++
[01:12] <gambi> Corey, emacs is great
[01:12] <petrik> Ooops does not appear to have save itself
[01:13] <arcade> Corey: Kate is very good.
[01:13] <arcade> Corey: You'll like Kate.
[01:13] <avalost> or gedit if you use gnome
[01:13] <arcade> Corey: Included with the KDE project, and is in kubuntu.
[01:13] <Subhuman> Corey, yes Kate is very similar to notepad ++
[01:13] <Subhuman> or u can still use kate in gnome
[01:14] <avalost> not if you don't have kde base
[01:14] <Corey> ok kate
[01:14] <Corey> is it
[01:14] <Corey> sudo get-apt install kate ?
[01:14] <Mortal|AFK> Where's the Synaptic repos list kept?
[01:14] <arcade> Corey: I guess so.
[01:14] <Mortal|AFK> Wait nvm
[01:14] <Corey> cause it didnt work :(
[01:14] <avalost> i think kate is in bundle
[01:14] <avalost> a*
[01:15] <Corey> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[01:15] <arcade> Corey: If not, then just apt-get install kubuntu-desktop :)  (one thing about that though, you'll get a HUGE load of KDE packages, and can change your desktop too KDE too, then.
[01:15] <avalost> with other stuff
[01:15] <avalost> Corey: using gnome?
[01:15] <Corey> yes i am
[01:15] <avalost> try gedit
[01:15] <Subhuman>   kate kdelibs-bin kdelibs-data kdelibs4c2a libarts1c2a libavahi-qt3-1  libopenexr2c2a menu-xdg
[01:15] <Subhuman> thats all i need to install it.
[01:15] <MiniJames> err guys
[01:15] <Subhuman> After unpacking 63.1MB of additional disk space will be used.
[01:15] <MiniJames> bluefish
[01:16] <eXistenZ> Corey, move to kubuntu then.
[01:16] <MiniJames> is good for php
[01:16] <Corey> everything im trying to install comes up with the same error
[01:16] <arcade> MiniJames: .. is that the HTML editor?
[01:16] <MiniJames> corey dont do it!
[01:16] <Corey> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[01:16] <MiniJames> yes
[01:16] <avalost> screw kubuntu!
[01:16] <spikeb> Corey: sudo apt-get -f install
[01:16] <MiniJames> dont instal KDE!
[01:16] <Corey> why ?
[01:16] <MiniJames> the dark side ;)
[01:16] <eXistenZ> ion3 > *
[01:16] <avalost> kde = ick :p
[01:16] <Subhuman> yeah Corey get bluefish
[01:16] <arcade> Corey: Because some people find it too easy to use ;)
[01:16] <MiniJames> its good
[01:16] <eXistenZ> ion3 > *
[01:16] <Subhuman> KDE is gank
[01:16] <eXistenZ> ion3 > *
[01:16] <MiniJames> its evil -- every time someone installs KDE a baby dolphin dies
[01:16] <Corey> wait which is a good one lol ?
[01:16] <petrik> Ok here is the link http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14622
[01:16] <MiniJames> please, think about the dolphins
[01:17] <Corey> why is KDE so bad ?
[01:17] <Subhuman> just sucks
[01:17] <MiniJames> im joking :P
[01:17] <Subhuman> trust us :D
[01:17] <Subhuman> :P
[01:17] <arcade> Subhuman: Except, of course, that KDE is easier to use, way more powerfull, got a faster development cycle, and so forth ..
[01:17] <MiniJames> i just prefer gnome
[01:17] <arcade> Corey: It's not bad. :)
[01:17] <Corey> does all gnome apps work ?
[01:17] <arcade> Corey: The *nix camp is just divided on what they like.
[01:17] <Subhuman> arcade, but it looks like crap, horrible config panel, more buttons/harder to use.... and so forth :P
[01:17] <arcade> Corey: Yes.
[01:17] <MiniJames> james@jameslaptop:~$ sudo apt-get install bluefish
[01:17] <Corey> whats blufish ?

[01:18] <avalost> eXistenZ: yes
[01:18] <Ng> Subhuman: #ubuntu-offtopic for opinions and KDE bashing please ;)
[01:18] <arcade> Subhuman: Got a more intuitive interface, great config panels, more buttons and functionality, easier to contribute to (especially as a translator).
[01:18] <eXistenZ> avalost, did you try ion3
[01:18] <e-fonz> Anyone know how to setup a server on ubuntu linux?
[01:18] <MiniJames> lol
[01:18] <Corey> grrrrrrrrrrr
[01:18] <avalost> eXistenZ: nop
[01:18] <Corey> You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these:
[01:18] <Corey> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[01:18] <Corey>   gaim: Depends: gaim-data (= 1:1.5.0-1ubuntu3) but 1:1.9.99.is.2.0.0+beta3-1ubuntu1 is to be installed
[01:18] <Corey> E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).
[01:18] <MiniJames> google it
[01:18] <eXistenZ> avalost, http://www.modeemi.fi/~tuomov/ion/
[01:18] <avalost> eXistenZ: thanks, looking
[01:18] <Subhuman> arcade, I used KDE for the first few months of my linux life, but once moving to gnome i couldnt go back.
[01:18] <MiniJames> sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade
[01:19] <MiniJames> then do bluefish install
[01:19] <Corey> i think i have a broken package..
[01:19] <Corey> I DO lol
[01:19] <Subhuman> Corey, do "sudo apt-get install gaim-data"
[01:19] <arcade> Subhuman: I first used twm, then fvwm2, then afterstep - then went on to using KDE 1.x ;)
[01:19] <arcade> Subhuman: Been using KDE ever since.
[01:19] <MiniJames> ive used both
[01:19] <MiniJames> i couldnt stand kde
[01:19] <Subhuman> arcade, well if you've never tried gnome dont knock it :D
[01:19] <arcade> Subhuman: I've also had my run ins with gnome, but I really didn't like the experience.
[01:20] <Corey> its giving me the same -f error !!!!
[01:20] <Subhuman> Corey, "sudo apt-get remove gaim && sudo apt-get install gaim gaim-data"
[01:20] <avalost> I used ximian gnome on mandrake 6.x switched to blackbox then to fluxbox and basically stuck with flux ever since
[01:20] <avalost> except short stints with new vers of kde/gnome/e17 etc

[01:23] <Subhuman> Corey, have you installed a version of gaim NOT from the repositories?
[01:23] <avalost> ok
[01:23] <Corey> yes..
[01:23] <Corey> just before
[01:23] <Corey> a beta version 2
[01:23] <Subhuman> well thats your problem
[01:23] <yassine> Help please, how to install the latest Blender
[01:23] <Corey> how do i get rid of ?
[01:23] <Subhuman> "sudo apt-get remove gaim gaim-data"
[01:24] <Subhuman> should do it.
[01:24] <Corey> i dont like gaim anyway ^_^
[01:24] <Corey> now where we where
[01:24] <Corey> so should install KDE ?
[01:25] <Subhuman> no
[01:25] <petrik> yassine, Do you have a website showing work you have done with blender? Where did you get the latest version from? Is it a package or source?
[01:25] <Corey> and can i still use...gnome .
[01:25] <Subhuman> "sudo apt-get install bluefish"
[01:25] <Subhuman> Corey, try bluefish instead
[01:25] <Corey> I just installed bluefish
[01:25] <Corey> ..hmm
[01:25] <Ng> yassine: the very latest version (2.41) is in dapper which is released a week today, or you could download it from their site (blender.org). The version in breezy is still fairly recent though (2.37a)
[01:25] <avalost> Corey: bluefish, quanta, screem are all good web development apps
[01:26] <Corey> is there any that are like notepad ++ ?
[01:27] <yassine> petrik, i download it from http://www.blender.org/cms/Blender.31.0.html
[01:27] <avalost> Corey: gedit is like notepad
[01:27] <Corey> also..has anyone ever got maya working on linux ?
[01:27] <MyNameIsNotBob> whats the default username and password for dapper?
[01:27] <avalost> type: gedit &
[01:27] <Subhuman> MyNameIsNotBob, there not.
[01:27] <avalost> in a terminal^
[01:27] <Subhuman> you have to set it during install
[01:27] <MyNameIsNotBob> Subhuman: what if it didn't?
[01:27] <Corey> no im talking notepad ++
[01:28] <yassine> Ng, what is dapper?
[01:28] <Ng> yassine: the next version of ubuntu
[01:28] <Subhuman> MyNameIsNotBob, well you mustve entered blank blank
[01:28] <Subhuman> I cant see how you couldnt though?
[01:28] <MyNameIsNotBob> Subhuman: doesn't work, it never prompted me
[01:28] <Corey> hey kde looks neet
[01:28] <GnarusLeo> How do I install new "views" or "themes" on mercury-messenger?
[01:29] <yassine> Ng, is it downloadable
[01:29] <petrik> Corey, sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression that you can run KDE programs under gnome as long as you had the correct libraries
[01:29] <Subhuman> GnarusLeo, new views, you just script in html
[01:29] <Subhuman> petrik, that is correct
[01:29] <Corey> petrik: well im new to linux so im not sure ^_^
[01:29] <GnarusLeo> I have a .mm thiny .. where do I put that Subhuman?
[01:29] <Subhuman> the qt libraries
[01:29] <Ng> yassine: yes and there should be a release candidate out today, but be aware that it's not officially released for another week, so there may well still be bugs
[01:29] <Subhuman> I'm not sure sorry
[01:30] <GnarusLeo> I have a zip file as well
[01:30] <GnarusLeo> Subhuman,
[01:30] <GnarusLeo> dont know where to put it?
[01:30] <Subhuman> nope
[01:30] <Corey> I should really amp up the linux communites look
[01:30] <Subhuman> never installed a theme, happy with the default :D
[01:30] <yassine> Ng, but is there a way to just install it on ubuntu
[01:31] <Corey> HELP
[01:31] <petrik> yassine, How is Blender? I used lightwave under windows and not sure if I should set it up under WINE or look for an alternative
[01:31] <Corey> im typing in here right
[01:31] <Ng> yassine: you can just do "sudo apt-get install blender" in a terminal and you'll get 2.37
[01:31] <Corey> and it keeps jumping back spaces
[01:31] <Corey> and its annoying me!
[01:32] <yassine> I did it, but I want to install the 2.41
[01:32] <petrik> Have not tried installing anything that runs on KDE yet but will have to soon just for the experience. Anyone got any advise? How do you know what libraries you need?
[01:32] <Ng> yassine: then you either have to download it from blender.org or upgrade to dapper
[01:32] <saquib> >> What's the BEST Audio Player for Linux......??
[01:33] <Corey> xmms
[01:33] <Ng> saquib: that's a matter of personal choice
[01:33] <FliesLikeABrick> saquib that is a matter of opinion, but I prefer xmms
[01:33] <Ng> saquib: play with a few of them and see which you like :)
[01:33] <Corey> yeah xxms is neat
[01:33] <Corey> its fast to :)
[01:33] <Corey> im using amarok now thoe
[01:33] <yassine> Ng, the fact is that I do not know how to install downloaded stuff :)
[01:33] <Ng> yassine: are you sure you can't wait a week and upgrade to dapper when it's released?
[01:34] <apokryphos> Corey: xmms sucks
[01:34] <petrik> yassine, What is the file you downloaded?
[01:34] <Corey> ..
[01:34] <Corey> amarok is slow
[01:34] <Ng> apokryphos: we really don't need an audio player war in here ;p
[01:34] <Corey> it takes ages to switch songs
[01:34] <Corey> like 1 second
[01:34] <yassine> Ng, sure, but I also would like to learn to install stuff
[01:34] <saquib> >>> but how can i make xmms Sound better?
[01:34] <Corey> xxms is immdeite
[01:34] <achandra> hello.im a little new to the ubuntu thing...just got ubuntu working with Drapper Drake...is that the latest most stable version?
[01:34] <apokryphos> Corey: there are other far better lightweight alternatives
[01:34] <Ng> yassine: then download it from blender.org and read the install instructions :)
[01:35] <ccc_> achandra: it's not stable yet. it will be released on june 1st.
[01:35] <petrik> What about a video player war? What can play quicktime 7 files?
[01:35] <yassine> petrik, I donwnloaded both
[01:35] <Ng> achandra: no, dapper is a pre-release. breezy is the current stable release. dapper will be the stable release in one week
[01:35] <ccc_> achandra: breezy badger is stable.
[01:35] <achandra> ccc_: so the version I have 6.0.6 is workable but not official release..right?
[01:35] <saquib> Corey: any special Output plugin....?
[01:35] <Corey> saquib: nope lol
[01:36] <achandra> ccc_: it works well on my amd64 laptop...:)
[01:36] <Ng> petrik: mplayer, xine or totem if you install win32codecs, I believe
[01:36] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Why the hell the boot shows up these three options for Ubuntu ''Ubuntu, Kernel 2.6.12-9-386", ''Ubuntu, Kernel 2.6.12-10-386" e "Ubuntu, memtest86+"??
[01:36] <ccc_> achandra: well yea. :)
[01:36] <Corey> um..is there any webcam drivers for linux ?
[01:36] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Couldn't be just one?
[01:36] <achandra> ccc_: no bs with X configs or bcm4318..it just works..:)
[01:36] <Ng> R_a_f_a_E_L: you have two kernels installed and the memtest one is for testing memory
[01:36] <yassine> petrik, I donwnloaded both, dynamic and static with python 2.4
[01:36] <saquib>  Corey: the ALSA plug in for XMMS sometimes have this weird sound in the music
[01:36] <Ng> R_a_f_a_E_L: you can remove the 2.6.12-9 kernel packages and that boot option will disappear
[01:37] <achandra> ccc_: i guess ill continue to use it until final release...thanks.
[01:37] <R_a_f_a_E_L> How can I remove it?
[01:37] <ccc_> achandra: great. just update it on june 1st and you'll have the "proper" version.
[01:37] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Bg
[01:37] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Ng
[01:37] <Ng> R_a_f_a_E_L: load up synaptic and search for linux-image, you'll see the installed ones
[01:37] <Ng> remove the old one
[01:38] <achandra> ccc_: thanks for taking the time to answer...appreciate it.:)
[01:38] <achandra> ccc-: it made my laptop come alive..rather than that BS winbloze media crap..
[01:38] <ramvi> What is the "best" video editing software for ubuntu? Something like Premiere? I can't find Cinelerra, jahshaka nor LiVES in the respories...
[01:40] <ccc_> achandra: good choice :)
[01:40] <ramvi> If I understand it correctly, Kino is a software for getting the dv film from the cam to the computer. so that wouldn't do me any good
[01:40] <Ng> ramvi: dapper has pitivi, which is supposd to be quite good, but is still very new. if you want cinelerra or so you'll have to install it by hand
[01:41] <petrik> yassine, http://download.blender.org/documentation/html/chapter_installation.html
[01:42] <ramvi> Ng, compile it myself and stuff. Thanks :) But how come it's not available from synaptic?
[01:42] <Ng> ramvi: either for licencing reasons or because nobody has packaged it up yet
[01:42] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Ng, remove just linux-image-2.6.12-9-386"
[01:42] <Ng> R_a_f_a_E_L: yep
[01:42] <ramvi> Right, thanks =)
[01:43] <petrik> avalost, Did you have a look at the pastebin? Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[01:43] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Ng, complete remotion?
[01:43] <yassine> petrik, I am reading it :)
[01:44] <Ng> R_a_f_a_E_L: yeah
=== allan__ is now known as killapop
[01:45] <petrik> yassine, I'm new to all this myself (well if you don't count my tinkering with linux on Mandrake 10 and Redhat 9 some years ago) so still learning the install processes myself
[01:46] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Ng, thanks very much...
[01:47] <yassine> petrik, yes it still remains a difficult task to make a clean install, which is done with one double-click under windows!!
[01:47] <achandra> My experience with Ubuntu so far compared to suse  on amd 64 gateway laptop - my sound works out of the box!My touchpad reponds perfectly!wireless no problem! - AWESSSSOOOME!

[01:48] <Ng> that's not an ubuntu kernel, is it?
[01:48] <M_A_K> Yes
[01:49] <Ng> from where? breezy is 2.6.12 and dapper is 2.6.15
[01:49] <M_A_K> It installed when I did an update to my laptop.
[01:49] <chapium> Hmm, I just ran updates on the US Repositories without any troubles...
[01:49] <M_A_K> I used the synaptic pkg mgr and it was one of the items.
[01:49] <spikeb> chapium: yeah the topic is old
[01:49] <M_A_K> I run the updater about once every 2 weeks.
[01:49] <Ng> M_A_K: could you find the package in synaptic and get its full package name?
[01:50] <stjepan> !nvu
[01:50] <ubotu> I guess nvu is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingNvu http://www.nvu.com/ Linux/Mac/Windows Web authoring.
[01:50] <M_A_K> I will try.
[01:50] <chapium> For some reason it updated the update manager.. in preparation for dapper?
[01:50] <McScruff> is there a way to use terminal server client and make it take up a full workspace or atleast scale it like the kde one does
=== MW|ZzzzzZZZ is now known as Most_Wanted
[01:50] <stjepan> do you know any "what you see is what you get" HTML editors for Linux? Something like MS Front Page or Dreameweaver, with support for frames?
[01:51] <M_A_K> Sorry, I guess I used the Update Manager, not synaptic.
[01:51] <M_A_K> stjepan : try nvu or bluefish
[01:51] <Larsson-Sweden> Why cant i play videos in fbxine? All i get is video port failed.
[01:52] <stjepan> M_A_K, Nvu has no support for frames
[01:52] <stjepan> and bluefish is not WYSIWYG
[01:52] <M_A_K> I was told it was, don't use wysiwyg myself, I write code...
[01:53] <Ng> M_A_K: it's just that, as far as I can tell, ubuntu has never released a 2.6.14 kernel, so you have picked that up from somewhere else and I would blame that for your wireless issues until its ruled out
[01:53] <stjepan> M_A_K, why you write code? It takes so much time... :(
[01:53] <e-fonz> I got Lamp running now, but can't copy files to the www folder anyone got an idea?
[01:53] <petrik> Anyone had any experience with a webcam freezing their machine?
[01:54] <M_A_K> Much better control.  I dont like other programs "inserting" junk i don't want.  besides, its fun ;-)
[01:54] <M_A_K> Ng : thanks.  I wonder why update manager installed it then?
[01:55] <Ng> M_A_K: if I had to guess I'd say that you've configured some third party package repositories
[01:55] <petrik> M_A_K, I tossed frontpage for that reason but found dreamweaver not as intrusive. It still did it to some degree
[01:55] <M_A_K> I will be more careful when running update manager from now on.
[01:56] <webwolf_27> can somebody help me with a dhcp-server problem?? My client can connect to the host but not to the internet
[01:56] <Ng> M_A_K: if I were you I'd load up synaptic, search for linux-image and make sure I have the most recent official ubuntu kernel installed, then reboot into that
[01:56] <M_A_K> petrik : I like dreamweaver the best of any for that reason.
[01:56] <e-fonz> is there a good linux alternative for dreamweaver?
[01:57] <satlan32> how do i call an IVR directly?
[01:57] <M_A_K> Ng : I still have the   2.6.12-10 installed and am booted into that currently.
[01:57] <webwolf_27> e-fonz: have a good look at bluefish
[01:57] <M_A_K> Petrik : have you ever tried dreamweaver with wine?
[01:57] <e-fonz> I got Bluefish, but i miss autofill in that!
[01:58] <rod> hi
[01:58] <webwolf_27> e-fonz: quanta
[01:58] <rod> i searched the forum and all
[01:58] <e-fonz> quanta?
[01:58] <rod> but how to install ms core fonts, it doesnt show up in my apt-cache search, although i got all the reps unmarked
[01:59] <petrik> M_A_K, Not yet. Played with linux some time ago. Now have tossed M$ out the window but have that and a 3D program that rely on M$ that I may still install that way. Other than that I'm looking for replacements for evrything else
[01:59] <webwolf_27> e-fonz: it's a kde package
[01:59] <Subhuman> rod "sudo apt-get install msttfcorefonts"
[01:59] <Ng> rod: do yo uhave multiverse enabled?
[01:59] <e-fonz> OK
[02:00] <Subhuman> rod, sorry msttcorefonts
[02:00] <e-fonz> damn i havent used irc in a long time, how do you get the colors again?
[02:00] <rod>  deb http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper-backports main restricted univ$   guess so
[02:00] <rod> oh wait
[02:00] <rod> bp
[02:01] <M_A_K> webwolf_27 : does quanta have all of the sql & php stuff like dreamweaver?
[02:01] <rod> thx Subhuman and Ng
[02:02] <rod> had multi enabled, but only on backports ? never had that before but oh well, nicely installing now ^^

[02:02] <webwolf_27> when I start my dhcp client I get an error "temporary failure in name resolution" what could be the problem
[02:02] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[02:03] <tuxtheslacker> how do I add a module to be loaded at start up?
[02:03] <Diegan> isn't there a way to move or delete files between ntfs drives?
[02:04] <tuxtheslacker> this thing seems to think that /etc/rc.d/init.d/vpn_client is where /etc/init.d/vpn_client is located.
[02:05] <e-fonz> what's the command to create a new folder in var/www?
[02:05] <webwolf_27> e-fonz: mkdir var/www/<dirname>
[02:05] <tuxtheslacker> e-fonz, mkdir /var/www/<folder_name>
[02:05] <e-fonz> LOL, thnx
[02:05] <forg> Why would a  usb HD stop appearing at /dev/sda1 I formatted it ext3 on another machine.? Mounted it on my xubuntu box, rebooted and now it doesn't appear and I don't have another machine to test it on
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> but can someone tell me where the startup scripts are located?
[02:06] <Dr_Willis> tuxtheslacker,  depends on which ones you are refering to
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> oh, forg, are you able to format in extt3? and how?
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> tuxtheslacker, I need to add a module to startup.
[02:06] <webwolf_27> tuxtheslacker: /etc/init.d
[02:06] <tuxtheslacker> for some reason, it's pointing to /etc/rc.d/init.d, and it's located in /etc/init.d
[02:06] <Dr_Willis> tuxtheslacker,  the file /etc/modules - is a list of modules to be auto-loaded
[02:07] <forg> tuxtheslac: I used qtparted on another box
[02:07] <forg> tuxtheslac: sorry ignore
[02:07] <tuxtheslacker> forg, I just had a one gig stick in a windows machine, and it stopped working on my linux machines, would that be why?
[02:08] <yccheok_> Any FreeImage library user here?
[02:08] <forg> tux: it went from fc4 -> xubuntu -> reboot -> fubur
[02:08] <forg> fubar
[02:09] <Diegan> isn't there a way to access and work with NTFS drives? Moving and deleting files?
[02:09] <tuxtheslacker> forg: it went slackware -> windows -> fubar
[02:09] <e-fonz> Ehm how do i change dirs?
[02:09] <tuxtheslacker> now I'm trying on ubuntu.
[02:09] <tuxtheslacker> e-fonz: cd /path/to/dir
[02:09] <OlliK> Diegan: It doesn't work perfectly yet in Linux
[02:09] <e-fonz> tnx again
[02:09] <OlliK> Diegan: It's better to create a FAT32 partition for sharing files between NTFS / Linux
[02:09] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, if I'm not mistaken, you use samba to do that :-)
[02:09] <philipp__> Hi, I'm searching for a Howto to enable Routing between two _private_ subnets. I don't want to masquerade
[02:10] <Naxo> hello
[02:10] <Naxo> good morning
[02:10] <philipp__> hi naxo
[02:10] <tuxtheslacker> Nameeater, mornin'.
[02:10] <Diegan> the thing is, my XP has stopped working due to malware
[02:10] <Naxo> iw ould like to know why Totem is part of ubuntu
[02:10] <Diegan> and I need to access my files in the main hard drive, and move them to my other hard drives
[02:10] <Diegan> so I can format and re-install windows
[02:11] <OlliK> Diegan: Reading from NTFS works perfectly
[02:11] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, can I get  a quick howto on formatting to ext3?
[02:11] <philipp__> Does anyone knows how to enable routing between to subnets without masquerading?
[02:11] <philipp__> two ;-)
[02:11] <Diegan> Ollik, I need to read, delete and move between ntfs drives
[02:11] <tuxtheslacker> er I mean forg*
[02:11] <arcade> philipp__: What are the subnets?
[02:11] <arcade> philipp__: If they use different IP's, there's no problem in enabling routing.
[02:11] <philipp__> 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.36.0/24
[02:11] <Naxo> philipp are u a ubuntu-dev?
[02:11] <philipp__> no
[02:12] <arcade> philipp__: do one box have both networks connected, or are there routers in between?
[02:12] <OlliK> Diegan: Make a Windows boot disk and do it in dos?
[02:12] <philipp__> arcade: One box have both networks connected (wlan and eth)
[02:12] <Naxo> well i just dont to understend abaut Totem
[02:12] <petrik> What happens if you write to a NTFS drive?
[02:12] <tuxtheslacker> OlliK, what problem is thta your fix for?
[02:12] <arcade> philipp__: just enable ip_forwarding
[02:12] <tuxtheslacker> OlliK, that's not a solution....
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, you can mount the drives, and do it that way.
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> it's not a perfect fix, but samba can do that.
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, ^^
[02:13] <Diegan> I can mount them, but then work with them?
[02:13] <philipp__> arcade: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward doesn't work
[02:13] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, also, you MAY be able to just mount the drives and deal with it that way (I don't know about with reading them)
[02:13] <Diegan> Ollik, I have tons of files and folders, I need a graphic interface
[02:14] <OlliK> Diegan: ah.. ic
[02:14] <petrik> Diegan, I've managed to mount mine and read from it. Have not tried writing to it
[02:14] <OlliK> petrik: writing won't work
[02:14] <rochfordo> philipp_, what does your routing table say?
[02:14] <Diegan> is there a "live" version of a windows interface?
[02:14] <tuxtheslacker> OlliK, if you mount the disk, that might work. just mount it and see how that works. Also, check out samba that may be what you need :-)
[02:14] <Nameeater> tuxtheslacker: morning o.O
[02:14] <OlliK> Diegan: How much free do you have in your HDs? How much files you got?
[02:14] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, BartPE
[02:14] <tuxtheslacker> hey Nameeater
[02:14] <philipp__> one moment, please
[02:14] <petrik> Damn that's going to mean I need to buy another drive to transfer it all to
[02:15] <tuxtheslacker> petrik, for what?
[02:15] <OlliK> Diegan: I don't think there is any WinXP Live-CDs
[02:15] <Diegan> I have enough to put all my data of main drive in another, if I clean un first
[02:15] <khafra> Is the Dapper Drake beta stable enough to give to a new-to-linuxy person, or should I install Breezy Badger for her?
[02:15] <Diegan> if not winXP, any windows based system
[02:15] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, OlliK, yes there are: it's called BartPD
[02:15] <tuxtheslacker> PE*
[02:15] <khafra> I've got Backtrack on the laptop right now
[02:15] <rochfordo> http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/
[02:15] <Diegan> I just downloaded it
[02:15] <OlliK> Diegan: Maybe you could use qparted to make all the available space to your ext3-partition in Linux, and copy all of the files there
[02:16] <Diegan> but I cant find windows installation files in my other comp
[02:16] <tuxtheslacker> http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/
[02:16] <tuxtheslacker> oh, rochfordo beat me to it :-)
[02:16] <tuxtheslacker> Diegan, ^^ go to that link and download :-)
[02:17] <petrik> Got a 120 gig in NTFS format chock full of data. Cant change file system with data on the drive
[02:17] <philipp__> rochfordo: on the router?
[02:18] <rochfordo> phillip_, on the linux box
[02:18] <rochfordo> route -n
[02:18] <rochfordo> you need entries respectively for both networks
[02:18] <philipp__> rochfordo: 10.0.0.0 over eth1 192.168.36.0 over eth0
[02:18] <rochfordo> with a default gw of the interfaces linked to the subnets
[02:19] <arcade> rochfordo: sounds wrong.
[02:19] <arcade> uhm
[02:19] <philipp__> rochforce: dest 0.0.0.0 over 192.168.36.1
[02:19] <rochfordo> uhuh
[02:19] <arcade> philipp__: Thing is.  Say you have eth0:192.168.0.1, and eth1:10.0.0.1
[02:19] <rochfordo> that's the default gw
[02:19] <arcade> And you only need routing between them.
[02:20] <philipp__> arcade: that's what I want
[02:20] <arcade> Then on all the clients on 192.168.0.0/24, you specify 192.168.0.1 and the gateway for 10.0.0.0/8
[02:20] <jackson> hi everybody
[02:20] <philipp__> arcade: rochfordo: I just want to have a connection between this subnets, no internet, nothing else ;-)
[02:20] <jackson> hi
[02:20] <tuxtheslacker> hi jackson
[02:20] <arcade> On all the clients on 10.0.0.0/8, you specify 10.0.0.1 as the gateway for 192.168.0.0/24
[02:21] <jackson> how are u guys ,,i am from tanzania ,,i enjoy using  UBUNTU
[02:21] <rochfordo> arcade, shouldn't really be nescessary
[02:21] <philipp__> arcade: uh, that may be the problem: the way back
[02:21] <arcade> route add -net 10.0.0.0/8 gw 192.168.0.1 if i remember correctly
[02:21] <arcade> on all the clients on 192.168.0.1
[02:21] <rochfordo> aaah
[02:21] <arcade> and on all the 10.0.0.0/8 machines you specify 'route add -net 192.168.0.0/24 gw 10.0.0.1"
[02:21] <chapium> jackson, grrreat
[02:22] <philipp__> now it works
[02:22] <chapium> jackson, how's the weather
[02:22] <arcade> philipp__: Good.
[02:22] <rochfordo> :)
[02:22] <philipp__> Thanks
[02:22] <jackson> I want to remote my other machine   on the next room,,but that machine have a XP can i get connected???
[02:22] <arcade> philipp__: no problem.
[02:22] <jackson> the wether is hot
[02:22] <philipp__> I didn't thought about the way from 192.168.36.0 to 10.0.0.0 ;-)
[02:22] <chapium> jackson, oooo
[02:22] <arcade> philipp__: Classic. :)
[02:22] <chapium> jackson, how are you wanting to remotely connect to the windows computer?
[02:22] <jackson> some help plz
[02:23] <chapium> jackson, remote desktop?
[02:23] <chapium> jackson, or do you just want to see the files?
[02:23] <rochfordo> or any one of a plethora of remote vulns chapium ;P
[02:23] <philipp__> now I'm able to watch my vdr-streams via wlan, quite nice.
[02:23] <jackson> i want to continue doing my worksheet i left on the other machine desktop,,can i???
[02:23] <POVaddct> jackson: install vnc server on the XP machine
[02:24] <jackson> i want to remote it ,as if i am there
[02:24] <chapium> if you have remote desktop enabled, you can use tsclient
[02:24] <arcade> or 'rdesktop' :)
[02:24] <jackson> i have vnc, but i want to  have the all accsec if i listean music i want it to be heard here were i am now
[02:25] <arcade> jackson: I don't think that's easy to do.
[02:25] <sonasks> i try to burn 4.3 GB file to a dvd-r, no luck at all
[02:25] <chapium> window's remote desktop is probably your best bet
[02:25] <chapium> that and running the music locally
[02:25] <arcade> jackson: That would include support for a remote sound server .. no idea whether you can play mp3's through rdp.
[02:25] <sonasks> i`m using growisofs
[02:25] <jackson> okey ,,its not easy ,,???/
[02:25] <arcade> jackson: Not the sound bit.
[02:25] <POVaddct> arcade: remote desktop with sound is only possible with rdp version 5.1. XP has only rdp version 5.0.
[02:26] <arcade> POVaddct: I really didn't need to know that, but thanks anyway ;)
[02:26] <POVaddct> arcade: sorry :) i meant jackson
[02:26] <philipp__> just learned another thing: wlan 11mbit is not enough for vdr-streams ;-)
[02:26] <twopeak> Is there an easy way to unmount an internal disk?
[02:26] <chapium> umount
[02:26] <arcade> POVaddct: It's horrible enough that I have to do administration on wintendos from time to time - I've been lucky enough not to use it personally since '99 ;D
[02:26] <jackson> oops am happy any way u guys are very suppotive thanks
[02:26] <arcade> philipp__: haha :)
[02:26] <rohan> hi all
[02:26] <arcade> philipp__: The important thing is that you got things up and running :D
[02:27] <rohan> isnt the dapper RC supposed to be out today ?
=== blitz is now known as FallenHitokiri
[02:27] <Dr_Willis> !tell rohan  about dapper
[02:28] <philipp__> arcade: my girlfriend has a 54mbit card........i thing that i just take her pc to view....
[02:28] <arcade> philipp__: hehe :)
[02:29] <philipp__> seeya, thanks!
[02:30] <sonasks> it really pisses me off - i can`t burn a single 4 GB file to a dvd-r with my backup
[02:30] <sonasks> jesus...
[02:30] <sonasks> how difficult is that ??
[02:30] <ompaul> !language
[02:30] <ubotu> Please watch your language. We try to be nice and help but some of us don't like to see such things on our screen.
[02:30] <sonasks> ok, sorry
[02:30] <ompaul> sonasks, it is not hard at all, do this
[02:31] <sonasks> oh, the frustration ...
[02:31] <sonasks> i tried growisofs, mkudffs
[02:31] <ompaul> sonasks, click on places, home and launch nautilus
[02:31] <sonasks> went through all the forum
[02:31] <petrik> linux and frustration are married
[02:31] <Wiener> Hello
[02:31] <ompaul> sonasks, Oi! just do what I am asking ;-) it worked for me yesterday
[02:32] <Wiener> Has anybody worked with a preseed installation?
[02:32] <sonasks> can i directly burn to a dvd via dvdrecord/cdrecord ??
[02:32] <sonasks> without making the image first ?
[02:32] <ompaul> sonasks, not without creating an image, it is not advisable, unless you like coasters
[02:32] <macsim> hi all, I'm uable to play a dvd, totem doesn't read it, I've install the libdvdcss following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats, I use totem-xine.
[02:32] <komao> I need help, I have troubles with icons in VNC sessions
[02:33] <sonasks> not even mentioning that every time i execute something on a drive, it takes ages
[02:33] <sonasks> and this smiley red led won`t even blink
[02:33] <sonasks> of course CD works fine
[02:33] <sonasks> reading the dvd works fine too
[02:33] <komao> In fact every icon is replaced by a sort of standard"file" icon
[02:34] <sonasks> but when it comes to dvd... ehh... - some 2GB limitations of files, even in UDF - i don`t know how this is possible
[02:34] <sonasks> UDF IS for big files, isn`t it ??
[02:34] <tubbie> the azureus popup messae is not disappearing when I click on close
[02:34] <arcade> sonasks: huh?
[02:35] <arcade> sonasks: Calm down and we can probably figure things out for you. :)
[02:35] <sonasks> :D
[02:35] <arcade> sonasks: First off, do you want to be able to do this graphically or from the command line?
[02:35] <sonasks> comamndline only
[02:35] <arcade> sonasks: And, is it the creation of the image that fails, or the burning of the image to the dvd-rom?
[02:36] <sonasks> well, both.. but i think, that the image creation fault is responsible for writing fail
[02:36] <arcade> sonasks: Okay, how do you attempt to create the image?
[02:36] <sinan> s
[02:36] <sonasks> ok, that`s nice : :-( /dev/hdc: media is not recognized as recordable DVD: 0
[02:36] <sonasks> i have a fresh TDK dvd-r in there
[02:37] <sonasks> here is the command i`m using for burning :
[02:37] <arcade> sonasks: Not interested in that.  Interested in the command.
[02:37] <arcade> sonasks: Begin with the command for creating the image.
[02:37] <sonasks> growisofs -dvd-compat speed=8 -Z /dev/hdc -R -J -pad /path_to_file
[02:38] <sonasks> this command returns the mentioned before errro
[02:38] <arcade> sonasks: sounds like a very wrong command, if /dev/hdc is your dvd-drive.
[02:39] <sonasks> welll
[02:39] <sonasks> it is /dev/hdc
[02:39] <arcade> oh.
[02:39] <arcade> combined mkisofs and burning program
[02:39] <tubbie> !java
[02:39] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[02:39] <sonasks> what do you mean ?
[02:40] <arcade> sonasks: I usually create the .iso first, then burn.
[02:40] <arcade> first mkisofs, then write out to the dvd-rom
[02:40] <sonasks> dunno - file too large blah blah
[02:41] <Fysidiko> I need to get a 6GB DVD ISO onto my Windows hard disk, but my FAT32 share can only take files up to 4GB
[02:41] <Fysidiko> Is there any way I can split it that Windows can then reconstruct?
[02:41] <sonasks> try rar
[02:42] <Fysidiko> OK
[02:42] <Fysidiko> Thanks
[02:42] <Fysidiko> How would I create a split rar file?
[02:42] <sonasks> you can split files in rar under linux, and then join them together under windows
[02:42] <rochfordo> sonasks, but it'll still be a 6gb iso
[02:42] <sonasks> install rar first, then do man rar
[02:42] <Fysidiko> ok
[02:43] <sonasks> oh, sorry
[02:43] <ubuntu> potter

=== BenC__ is now known as BenC
[02:48] <gnomefreak> karim: than your prolly trying to compile it with wrong gcc
[02:48] <karim> I have this problem since some time
[02:48] <karim> gnomefreak, the compile works with dpkg-buildpackage
[02:49] <Intangir> does anyone know of a repartitioning software for linux that doesnt destroy a partition when you resize it?
[02:49] <gnomefreak> Intangir: gparted or qtparted
[02:49] <sonasks> ok, that`s i will download files through ftp, and burn it under windows
[02:49] <gnomefreak> karim: ive never used that way to build anything i normally use the tar
[02:50] <Intangir> gnomefreak: that lets you resize partitions without destroyign them? does it work with NTFS?
[02:50] <karim> gnomefreak, apt-build is like emerge
[02:51] <gnomefreak> Intangir: it should
[02:51] <gnomefreak> karim: i know what apt-build is i just only used it once
[02:51] <Intangir> cool ill check it out
[02:51] <karim> gnomefreak, I use it on powerpc right now, but had the same error on amd64 or i386. don't know what's wrong
[02:53] <nubix> hey i got a question...i f'ed up my video driver trying to use the via driver instead of vesa driver...anyway i fixed using dselect and apt-get to remove and reinstall xserver-xorg...is there a better way?

[02:54] <nubix> anyone know? cuz i want to experiment with different drivers
[02:55] <choichoi_> hello
[02:55] <hyphenated> yccheok_: it needs libfreeimage.so at build time, not libfreeimage-3.8.0.so
[02:55] <choichoi_> I have a problem with nvidia-glx when I install it I have an error in unpack :
[02:55] <choichoi_> diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib/nvidia/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa by nvidia-glx' clashes with `diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib/nvidia/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa by nvidia-glx-legacy

[02:56] <Kane666> hey
[02:56] <nytr8_> how do i specify the location of rgb.txt in XFree86
[02:56] <chapium> choichoi- did you sudo?
[02:56] <nytr8_> It was missing i placed it back into its location
[02:56] <hyphenated> choichoi_: it looks like you're trying to install nvidia-glx and already have nvidia-glx-legacy installed
[02:57] <tuxtheslacker> hey, can someone tell me where I can find the cdrao packages?
[02:57] <nytr8_> Application initialization failed: this isn't a Tk applicationunknown color name "Black"
[02:57] <nytr8_> that s the error i get
[02:57] <hyphenated> tuxtheslacker: you probably want cdrdao
[02:58] <karim> gnomefreak, the error is  checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[02:58] <hyphenated> tuxtheslacker: and it's in the 'universe' repository, if you haven't enabled it already
[02:58] <tuxtheslacker> that'd be it hydroksyde_ :-)
[02:58] <hyphenated> karim: install the 'build-essential' package
[02:58] <tuxtheslacker> hyphenated, *
[02:58] <tuxtheslacker> I read it wrong :-P
[02:58] <karim> hyphenated, it's installed ...
[02:58] <karim> hyphenated, I try to build with apt-build but it fails
[02:59] <albinoloverats> is there a way to check if terminal is a login terminal or not, using bash script?
[02:59] <gnomefreak> karim: i would try gcc-3.4
[03:00] <gnomefreak> apt-build maybe trying to build it with gcc4 and joe might have been build with gcc3.4
[03:00] <deleea> hej! does anybody know how to install the last.fm player? I've tried to follow the instructions but somehow  I can't copy the file into /lib...
[03:00] <tuxtheslacker> wow, and everything works too.... I'll stick with ubuntu :-)
[03:01] <tuxtheslacker> The only thing that bothers me is that I can't get the cisco vpn module to load on startup :-/.
[03:01] <Fysidiko> How do I create a rar archive?
[03:02] <choichoi_> hyphenated, there is the same error when I try to install nvidia-glx-legacy
[03:03] <karim> gnomefreak, the build goes fine with dpkg-buildpackage on the same source
[03:03] <ben_underscore> anyone know much about xfce4 on ubuntu?
[03:03] <gnomefreak> choichoi_: sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-glx-legacy
[03:03] <gnomefreak> karim: dpkg has nothing to do with gcc
[03:04] <gnomefreak> ben_underscore: in daper yes
[03:04] <gnomefreak> dapper*
[03:04] <karim> gnomefreak, ok bu dpkg-buildpackage succes where apt-build fails, so I am wondering

[03:30] <Answer> tubbie, i think gcc
[03:31] <Healot> !build
[03:31] <ubotu> If you want to build software, you need the build-essential package to start with

[03:31] <ubotu> Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Healot
[03:31] <Answer> or gcc-4.0 depends on the version

[03:31] <gnomefreak> skript: run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  when thats done run gksudo "update-manager -d"
[03:31] <mdeboer> tomorrow i will be installing dapper on a friends computer, an AMD64. if i would install it for myself, i'd definitely go for the amd64 version, but since he is rather new to linux, i am thinking that it might be better to go for i386.... what do you think?
[03:32] <gnomefreak> skript: after that reboot adn poof your on dapper
[03:32] <gnomefreak> !upgrade
[03:32] <ubotu> well, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[03:32] <Dr_Willis> anil,  you may want to read that 'advance bash guide' (google for it) (the package may be abs to be installed)
[03:32] <Answer> mdeboer, use 64bit version since u have 64bit system!
[03:32] <Khamael> how come it is hard or impossible to change msn name in gaim?
[03:32] <Answer> Khamael, msn is evil...
[03:33] <pippo> !it
[03:33] <ubotu> Vai su #ubuntu-it o su #kubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[03:33] <Dr_Willis> theres lots of little annoying problems with using the 64bit disrtos. :( flash, and other annoyances.
[03:33] <gnomefreak> Khamael: because gaim didnt make the msn name for you you have to make another account iirc
[03:33] <mdeboer> Dr_Willis: right.
[03:33] <njan> mdeboer, last time I checked, i386 was quite a bit more userfriendly, since 64-bit distros have problems with binary software not designed for 64-bit systems.
[03:33] <njan> mdeboer, flash being one example of that..
[03:33] <Khamael> Answer: yes, but all my evil little friends are using it
[03:33] <Healot> it isn't about friendliness
[03:33] <mdeboer> right, flash is definitely something he wants to use
[03:33] <Answer> Khamael, well msn has proprietary protocols which gaim was able to figure out for chatting, but not for updating account info
[03:34] <Healot> it's about programmers who are not willing to write/compile 64bit applications
[03:34] <Answer> 64bit is the koolest
[03:34] <njan> Healot, which causes the OS not to be friendly.
[03:34] <elkbuntu> i'd put off installing 64bit until it matures a bit more
[03:34] <Dr_Willis> ive seen little gains for my needs from using 64bit
[03:34] <Khamael> Answer: ok. just found out that amsn does change names.. but it`s ugly
[03:34] <njan> Healot, since it requires work and/or knowledge in order to actually get a 64-bit distribution working to the same extent that the 32-bit one is out of the box.
[03:34] <runes> mdeboer how did oyu get dapper
[03:34] <Healot> don't expect people from Adobe/Macromedia to write 64bit app, njan
[03:35] <elkbuntu> they will eventually
[03:35] <Healot> and don't blame 64bit distro for being stupid
[03:35] <nubix> can someone help me install via unichrome pro driver? it says to edit /etc/X11/XvMCConfig but i don't see that file anywhere
[03:35] <mdeboer> okay, this confirms my thoughts.
[03:35] <njan> Healot, I'm not blaming it, and I'm not expecting anything. I'm just saying that it's easier to use a 32-bit distro
[03:35] <dsl957> Khamael, what about changing name with amsn and then using gaim?
[03:35] <sugoruyo> hi all
[03:35] <njan> Healot, there's no scurrying about to find alternative clients, and no chrooting to use 32-bit libraries for things that don't have or like 64-bit ones.
[03:35] <Healot> njan, there are workarounds though...
[03:35] <gnomefreak> biggest issues with 64bit and ppc is the non-free apps/programs are not writen for them due to lack of users
[03:36] <Healot> things will change eventually
[03:36] <runes> gnomefreak seems like intel and amd are pusing the 64 bit architecture
[03:36] <njan> Healot, Yes, there are workarounds. But like I said at the very beginning of this thread, it's *less* userfriendly, and the dude was asking about a system for his non-linux-savvy-friend.
[03:36] <sugoruyo> i'm installing dapper flight7 on a vaio and i want to get it set up with codecs and most desktop stuff
[03:36] <Khamael> dsl957: that seems to be the only way. no prob for me, because I seldom change, but what about jou user? who wants to have everything work with one client?
[03:36] <sugoruyo> is there some kind of guide for this stuff?
[03:36] <runes> you'd think they would just write the apps to support eh platform?
[03:36] <njan> Healot, so, to re-state, 64-bit ubuntu is less userfriendly, and less suitable for someone new to linux.
[03:36] <gnomefreak> runes: they are now but this has been like this for a while
[03:36] <Healot> PPC might die, but 64bit x86 will reign someday
[03:36] <Khamael> dsl957: Joe User
[03:36] <mdeboer> ok, thanks a lot for your advice!
[03:37] <karim> gnomefreak runes, I pasted the config.log here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14623 . I tried to export gcc3.4 but it fail the same way. there is a lot of unkwnown things in the log. I don't know what it means
[03:37] <karim> but there is not as much errors on K7
[03:37] <mdeboer> and, a related question, would you recommend flight7 or the daily build?
[03:37] <Healot> flight 7
[03:37] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: rc should be released today
[03:38] <gnomefreak> i recomment that
[03:38] <dsl957> hamael, yes it should be fixed
[03:38] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: that is interesting news
[03:38] <stjepan> I've got an image inside a HTML table columnt and I want to align the image to top of the cell. What should I do?
[03:38] <njan> Healot, ppc won't die.. there are way too many systems using it for that.
[03:38] <dsl957> Khamael, yes it should be fixed
[03:38] <njan> Healot, it just won't be used in as many desktop systems.
[03:39] <Healot> yeah, die in desktopland....
[03:39] <dsl957> stjepan, valing=top
[03:39] <stjepan> tnx
[03:39] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: dailybuild should be at rc or just before give me a few and ill let you know if rc has been uploaded yet
[03:39] <Healot> but for high end processing it will stay
[03:39] <karim> gnomefreak ok, the processor is unkown ...
[03:39] <karim> I guess that's the problem
[03:39] <njan> Healot, not just high-end processing. It looks like most of the next generations of consoles are going to be PPC-based
[03:39] <Healot> karim, new MB with Sempron??
[03:40] <karim> Healot, no, very old pwoermac G4
[03:40] <Healot> njan, today's games are high end isn't
[03:40] <Healot> especially consoles
[03:40] <njan> Healot, that didn't make any sense
[03:40] <lukketto> !list
[03:40] <ubotu> well, list is you can see a list of things I know at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbotuUsage
[03:40] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: thanks. i will have to live in an hour, after which i will not have cd-burner access anymore, so i might be forced to go for dailybuild, but i'll wait as long as possible
[03:42] <dsl957> sorry, wrong button
[03:42] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseCandidateAnnouncement?highlight=%28dapper%29  you will have to copy and paste the mirror into your browser but should work
[03:43] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: thanks a lot
[03:43] <gnomefreak> yw
[03:45] <planetguru> aye
[03:45] <Healot> aye aye
[03:46] <planetguru> this nickserv thing always messes me up - if I haven't forgotten my password, my nick's not available, or I can't remember which nick I used..
[03:47] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: i only see beta2 following those links...
[03:47] <gnomefreak> they prolly havent been uploaded yet than
[03:47] <Larsson-Sweden> fireglcontrol isnt detecting my tv anymore. tv-out is working fine but it is not detected. Need to make some dri changes! Any ideas?
[03:48] <runes> might have to put gcc-3.4
[03:48] <sugoruyo> can anyone help
[03:48] <Healot> the tv-out worked before, Larsson-Sweden?
[03:48] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: hold that thought please
[03:48] <cr3> sugoruyo: what seems to be the problem?
[03:49] <sugoruyo> i'm installing dapper flight7 on a vaio and i want to get it set up with codecs and most desktop stuff
[03:49] <sugoruyo> is there some kind of guide for this stuff?
[03:49] <planetguru> I'm in a cyclic dependency hell - two packages are uninstallable, because they rely on eachother.. starting with libqt3-mt and then with libstdc++5  - is there a way out of this please?
[03:49] <planetguru> I'm on Dapper Drake
[03:49] <siccness> sugoruyo: Automatix
[03:49] <mdeboer> ...
[03:49] <Larsson-Sweden> Healot, yes, it is still working, but there is no option for it in fireglcontrol
[03:50] <runes> planetguru which version of dapper is the most "stable"
[03:50] <Larsson-Sweden> Healot, should be an "TV-OUT" tab there.
[03:50] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: doesnt look like they were uploaded yet but heres a better site https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperRC
[03:50] <planetguru> runes - no idea. I just installed the 'latest' about a week ago
[03:50] <Dr_Willis> !automatix
[03:50] <ubotu> hmm... automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
[03:50] <gnomefreak> siccness: dont recomment automatix
[03:50] <siccness> Oh
[03:50] <siccness> My apologies.
[03:50] <sugoruyo> !easyubuntu
[03:50] <ubotu> rumour has it, easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
[03:50] <Dr_Willis> dont even acknolodge its existance. :P
[03:51] <sugoruyo> does it work on dapper?
[03:51] <siccness> Heh, I didn't even know it was such an issue. Thanks for informing me though, I'll take this into consideration when I install DD.
[03:51] <Ng> even easyubuntu isn't a great idea - you'll learn a lot more if you follow the wiki instructions for each of the bits it does
[03:52] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: ok, i will keep watching the servers, or else go for the daily build
[03:52] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: i would think by this afternoon (here) it shoudl be uploaded
[03:52] <gnomefreak> but we will see
[03:53] <Crane> hello
[03:53] <siccness> I'm not sure if I can be bothered waiting another week for final, I'll probably just go with RC
[03:53] <mdeboer> gnomefreak. ok thanks
[03:53] <antisocial_boris> how do i change the default media player that firefox uses?
[03:53] <cr3> easyubuntu is quite nice, thanks for the tip
[03:55] <gnomefreak> mdeboer: are you on breezy atm?
[03:55] <anil> Dapper Drake have VIM 7?
[03:55] <gnomefreak> anil: no it will be in edgy eft
[03:55] <sugoruyo> i need it to be up and running rather quickly and i already have 600 megs of updates to get on my 384 connectino
[03:56] <sugoruyo> so i'll stick with easyubuntu - if it works well enough
[03:56] <gnomefreak> bbl work to do
[03:56] <Healot> sugoruyo: if you prefer, then stick with it
[03:57] <anil> what is edgy eft?
[03:57] <sugoruyo> i think i'll try out the wiki instructions on some other machine
[03:57] <sugoruyo> but for now i need this thing quick
[03:57] <doped1> installed gpass with a provided deb pkg, but where should i find it, so i could make a shortcut?
[03:58] <sugoruyo> and i have hardware detection probs
[03:58] <sugoruyo> too
[03:58] <twopeak> Is there a way to use the micro of my (already recognized) webcam?
[03:59] <ghb> Adept crashed and now I can't get out of read-only mode. Doesn't matter if I reboot the computer. =(
[03:59] <Ng> anil: the next version of ubuntu after dapper
[03:59] <Ng> anil: so 6 months away at least
[04:00] <anil> ok
[04:00] <MiniJames> type xkill in console
[04:01] <freezey> can someone answer an apache2 question?
[04:01] <MiniJames> and kill adept with it
[04:01] <ghb> MiniJames: Done that. Still doesn't work. There's something running without a GUI or anything that's blocking the database.
[04:01] <MiniJames> ah
[04:01] <MiniJames> hm
[04:01] <anil> how to copy any name in the textbox I am typing in X-chat? any shortcut?
[04:02] <MiniJames> ctrl-c = copy
=== ohoel_ is now known as _ohoel
[04:02] <MiniJames> just open a dialoge box
[04:02] <MiniJames> and then copy their name from the bar @ top of the new window
[04:03] <HymnToLife> !anyone
[04:03] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? </hint>
[04:03] <MiniJames> lol
[04:03] <MiniJames> </rant>
[04:03] <MiniJames> ;)
[04:03] <runes> where can I find a good manual on user administration
[04:03] <MiniJames> google.com
[04:03] <Dr_Willis> ne1 kno NE thing....
[04:04] <MiniJames> i dont ;)
[04:04] <Healot> runes: online? tldp.org maybe
[04:04] <Dr_Willis> amazing at the # of docs out online.
[04:04] <MiniJames> i know nothing (no pun on faulty towers)
[04:04] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: yeah, why?
[04:04] <Healot> for books... hum
[04:04] <ghb> How do I kill something that isn't there and is blocking the package database? Adept goes into read-only mode all the itme.
[04:04] <ghb> *time
[04:04] <MiniJames> task manager
[04:04] <mdeboer> gnomefreak: also got a dapper running. i'm at work.
[04:05] <MiniJames> system monitor i think its called
[04:05] <cdubya> is there a good offline dictionary application that you can download?
[04:05] <MiniJames> yeah, use the system monitor
[04:05] <MiniJames> and look @ list of processes
[04:05] <ghb> MiniJames: There's no adept process there. What processes could be blocking the database? Adept is killed, so there must be something else.
[04:05] <MiniJames> hm
[04:05] <MiniJames> nfc :)
[04:05] <ghb> nfc?
[04:05] <Healot> i know some for japanese... but english, i don;t know any
[04:05] <MiniJames> no f*ing clue :)
[04:05] <ghb> Haha ok.
[04:06] <anil> why u ppl prefer for Google, tell them del.icio.us/tag/theirtag
[04:06] <Intangir> can open office view pdf files?
[04:06] <MiniJames> :/
[04:06] <anil> I prefer del.icio.us in finiding info
[04:06] <anil> hey is there any good book on ubuntu?
[04:06] <MiniJames> google.com really just means "use a search engine"
[04:06] <MiniJames> but, people are lazy :)
[04:06] <MiniJames> google.com is easy
[04:07] <anil> MiniJames dont use vulgur words
[04:07] <MiniJames> :S i didnt
[04:07] <Healot> anil: he censored :)
[04:07] <MiniJames> ^^
[04:08] <runes> MiniJames google might be useful bur for newbies getting accurate info and not compromising their machines seciryt is generally the reason we come here
[04:08] <runes> according to the ethics pages on ubuntu site
[04:08] <Healot> he has automatic censorship i guess
[04:08] <MiniJames> the guy wanted a manual
[04:08] <MiniJames> so i suggested he searched for one
[04:08] <MiniJames> is that a problem?
[04:09] <MiniJames> runes: you misunderstand what I said --- read everything i said about search engines
[04:09] <anil> where can I download .deb packages directly
[04:09] <MiniJames> runes: your taking it out of context
[04:09] <HymnToLife> for ubuntu : http://packages.ubuntu.com
[04:09] <Healot> packages.ubuntu.com anil
[04:09] <Healot> that's my recommendation
[04:09] <anil> So I have a backup copies of all software I want
[04:10] <HymnToLife> anil> it will be hell to trace all dependencies
[04:10] <Healot> ALL anil ?
[04:10] <javiolo> hi, can anyone recommend me a mail notifier ?
[04:10] <MiniJames> runes: dont worry :)
[04:10] <anil> Can I directly download them from http://packages.ubuntu.com
[04:10] <anil> yeah!
[04:10] <makro> Hmm, just trying Xubuntu 6.06 live, what on earth is the username/password?
[04:10] <Healot> anil, no, but they will provide links
[04:11] <MiniJames> runes: i cant pm back -- not logged in

[04:11] <anil> ok

[04:30] <anil> any Indian here
[04:30] <SS2> HymnToLife: ok, thx wasn't so shure
[04:30] <DBO> lauri, more detail please =)
[04:31] <lauri> DBO, but the new installation didnt see the other partition.
=== Kadran_ is now known as Kadran
[04:31] <DBO> lauri, yes, you have to mount the other partition
[04:32] <lauri> DBO, How can i do that?
[04:32] <DBO> !mount
[04:32] <ubotu> somebody said mount was the command to add partitions to your filesystem - for full instructions see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingANewHardDrive For mounting windows partitions, see !windowsdrives or http://tinyurl.com/bly9f
[04:32] <lauri> DBO, I fascinated with LINUX, but i have no experience in it
[04:32] <anil> tell me name of any best timepass game which I can install from apt-get
[04:33] <DBO> lauri, no problem, check out the wiki, see if you can get it that way (you'll learn best if I just dont feed you commands) and if not come back and see me

[04:35] <anil> which is the bset theme for ubuntu(gnome)?
[04:35] <runes> time to install ubuntu 6.06 brb
[04:35] <Healot> human...
[04:35] <Healot> the old 5.04 human
[04:35] <SS2> POVaddct: thx, looks very simple
[04:35] <lauri> DBO, Thanks
[04:35] <HymnToLife> the Breezy one
[04:35] <SS2> and what a theme ;)
[04:35] <POVaddct> SS2: but it's fun
[04:36] <anil> tell me most popular theme for ubuntu(gnome)
[04:36] <DBO> clearlooks
[04:36] <SS2> anil: look at www.gnome-look.org there you will see
[04:36] <anil> no I dont want default, I want popular
[04:37] <Ng> clearlooks isn't the default
[04:37] <Ng> human is the default
[04:37] <Ng> pick a theme you like from gnome-look.org or art.gnome.org
[04:37] <Diiba> Btw, im using ubuntu with xfce 4, and i cant get any icons to my desktop.
[04:37] <Ng> who cares what other people like?
[04:37] <Diiba> Is this normal?
[04:37] <anil> but I dont want installed I want for download, popular?
[04:37] <DBO> Ng, human is the default for ubuntu, clearlooks is the default for a standard gnome install
[04:37] <Ng> DBO: indeed
[04:37] <Ng> Diiba: I don't think xfce renders a desktop as such, but it's a long time since I used it
[04:37] <Diiba> Ok.
[04:37] <Diiba> Thats what i tought.

[05:00] <userone> I just looked at the gaim homepage, and there is no mention of a gaim-vv or webcam support?
[05:00] <MiniJames> ubuntu webcam support isnt brilliant
[05:00] <MiniJames> from what ive heard
[05:00] <Archville> I think there is still no webcam support.
[05:01] <MiniJames> you can receive webcam with amsn ;)
[05:01] <Archville> But, you can use it with amsn.
[05:01] <MiniJames> ^^
[05:01] <chapium> njan: yakuake works much better with konsole installed :D
[05:01] <OlliK> amsn?
[05:01] <MiniJames> sudo apt-cache search amsn
[05:01] <njan> chapium, it isn't a dependency?
[05:01] <chapium> nope
[05:01] <OlliK> msn sucks
[05:01] <BlueEagle> njan: I wonder how well that will work with the cygwin x-server over ssh. :)
[05:01] <MiniJames> its not that bad :)
[05:01] <chapium> i think something else is broken though.. its missing some graphics or something
[05:01] <Healot> MiniJames: don't say that. most manufacturers of webcams are to blame, they just don't do OS independent hardware
[05:02] <userone> minijames: amsn will only work with MSN I take it? What about Yahoo?
[05:02] <njan> chapium, are you a gnome user?
[05:02] <njan> chapium, I wouldn't be installing it in gnome.. you probably need half of kde to make it work

[05:04] <njan> dracflamloc, not afaik
[05:04] <rod>  is there a way to make the original grapical bittorrent app which comes with dapper make use of a different port beside the standard one?

[05:05] <njan> dracflamloc, I like it. And it does tabs :)

[05:05] <Grout58> http://www.parallels.com/en/download/
[05:05] <dracflamloc> could be an easy option to add

[05:06] <Healot> one more week, trippy
[05:06] <tripppy> get dapper stable?
[05:06] <njan> tripppy, afaik it will get sent out once it's released.
[05:06] <MiniJames> hm
[05:06] <Healot> CDs would be sent within 3 - 6 weeks
[05:06] <ccc_> tripppy: you can order one now
[05:06] <Grout58> dapper is still comming out june 1st right?
[05:06] <MiniJames> yah
[05:06] <BlueEagle> njan: Well, with the rootwindow shown it works ok, but that's just nasty. :p
[05:06] <userone> I found this:
[05:06] <MiniJames> look @ the wiki
[05:06] <userone> I found this: Oct 07, 2005 - Forward potr of gaim-vv 1.2.0 to gaim cvs head is working. I would like to clarify that gaim-vv isn't completely dead, we're working on merging with gaim. There will be no further gaim-vv releases, as code will be added to the main gaim program.
[05:07] <userone> Anyone know any latest news on this project?
[05:07] <Grout58> so is this Parallels Workstation 2.1 for Linux the same parallels i've been hearing about for osx?

[05:19] <soundray> flossgeek: thanks
[05:19] <Larsson-Sweden> Ng, ok. Well the problem i have is that there are tearing in videos. I am using the fglrx driver and when trying non-tearing video drivers such as vidix or XV, there is only a blank image where the video should be on my TV. I can use the gl2 driver and enable vsync in driconf, but then i only get non-tearing on my monitor and tearing on my TV. Was thinking about using fbxine with vidix driver cause that would solve my problem, but i only get a "Video
[05:19] <Larsson-Sweden> port failed" error message. Do you have any ideas?
[05:20] <soundray> rpedro: set it at the login screen.
[05:20] <flossgeek> at current i have a /root partition thats bootable, a /home partition and a swap which rins breezy

[05:20] <rpedro> soundray: ah, ok :)
[05:21] <flossgeek> do i need another swap?
[05:21] <flossgeek> im not use to the g-parted thing either

[05:38] <snyyd> Does Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 LTS PC (Intel x86) text-mode install CD have the GUI partitioner and boot screen? (Like previous install CDs) I'm a bit thrown off by the "text-mode install"
[05:39] <hav0k> ive got my windows partition mounted and i was trying to navigate to the Program Files throught the terminal, but it wont let me saying, "bash: cd: Program: No such file or directory"
[05:39] <hav0k> how can i get to it?
[05:39] <paradizelost> snyyd: text mode install means just that
[05:39] <paradizelost> it's all text
[05:39] <paradizelost> no gui
[05:39] <BlueEagle> hav0k: cd "Program files"
[05:39] <POVaddct> hav0k: cd "Program Files"
[05:39] <hav0k> put it in quotes then
[05:39] <BlueEagle> hav0k: cd program\ files
[05:39] <paradizelost> hav0k: you need quotes, or just make use of bash's tab completion
[05:39] <POVaddct> hav0k: or simple cd Prog<TAB>
[05:39] <BlueEagle> hav0k: or escape the space
[05:40] <hav0k> ah, good point
[05:40] <hav0k> i didnt know it had that
[05:40] <snyyd> paradizelost: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperbeta?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=gfxboot-small.png
[05:40] <hav0k> thanks guys
[05:40] <snyyd> paradizelost: So why does it have that shot on he dapperbeta page?
[05:41] <paradizelost> snyyd: that's probably installing from the livecd
[05:41] <snyyd> paradizelost: It specifically says "installation CD"
[05:42] <paradizelost> "installation CD" doesn't mean the i386 text mode installation cd
[05:42] <paradizelost> because IIRC, the livecd's w/ dapper are now supporting installing from them
[05:43] <NoUse> paradizelost the live cd is the "preferred" installation method as of dapper
[05:43] <snyyd> It's a bit confusing.
[05:44] <jani_> i still prefer the install cd than the livecd...
[05:44] <paradizelost> same here.
[05:45] <Archville> I still miss the feature of installing just the packages you want.
[05:45] <jani_> the livecd dont include some of my partitions as an available partition to have the distro installed
[05:45] <roast> is there a 'bundled' package name for the [basic]  development tools such as make, gcc3, etc.?
[05:46] <Archville> roast: build-essential

[05:47] <roast> Archville, paradizelost: aha. thanks.
[05:47] <roast> Archville, paradizelost: I'm still used to the old debian task- packages unfortunately
[05:47] <Archville> :)
[05:47] <paradizelost> roast: also, for a lot of things, you'll need your linux-headers-`uname -r` as well
[05:48] <Larsson-Sweden> Why does not fbxine work in Ubuntu? It says "Video port failed" when trying to play a video. How can this be solved?

[06:00] <interprb> Hi all, can anyone tell me which files to look for in the boot process that would request an "a" record to a  domain.
[06:01] <J_P> hi all
[06:02] <kyle__> hi all, hoping someone can help me -im running Breezy on an HP compaq nx4300, and im a newbie (sorry1).  All is going smoothly, but i can get sound working.  Ive googled for days, but no solution works.  Any ideas?
[06:03] <kyle__> :cant get sound working
[06:03] <unperson> kyle__:  Can you be a bit more specific about what is happening?  E.g. what program have you tried to play sound with?
[06:04] <EnTeQuAk> hi @ all :)
[06:04] <unperson> Have you gotten any error messages?
[06:04] <Intangir> hey guys, how can i make an .iso boot off of a usb flash stick?
[06:05] <kyle__> i've treid totem, mplayer and the standard CD player and they all play the files/cd but no sound comes from the speakers.  I runa a dualboot setup, and the sound works in windows so i think it must be a driver issue
[06:05] <DBO> Intangir, that is very hard to do since you have to get the USB drivers loaded at a different time than normal, it can be done, but its easier just to use DSL's installer
[06:05] <Ng> kyle__: possibly a silly question, but have you fired up a mixer and made sure things aren't just set to 0 or muted?
=== X3n0n_iMac_ is now known as X3n0n_iMac
[06:06] <kyle__> LOL, i checked the mixers and everything is crancked right up

[06:06] <Ng> I know it's silly, but sometiems the mixers default to very daft values
[06:06] <J_P> people, What app I use to run one file.swf on ubuntu ?
[06:06] <kyle__> lol - thanks! im stumped on this one - im new to this, and this has been my only hickup!

[06:08] <kyle__> crimsun - sorry, im a complete newbie not sure what you mean
[06:08] <Mysta_> anyone see that ATI released new drivers?
[06:08] <crimsun> kyle__: open a Terminal, type amixer, paste the output onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org, and tell me the url

[06:14] <ompaul> DBO what is stranger (referring to your !dapper, in other words random stranger) is >>named -v <<  tells you the version of bind, and don't ask the other (implying bind -v), I still have not figured out why that happens
[06:14] <unperson> XTF: I think you need to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.

[06:16] <freezey> i am trying to remove apache2 from this pc to reinstall it but /etc/apache2 still stays there
[06:16] <DBO> google =)  it knows the answer to everything =P
[06:16] <freezey> do i just have to remove the whole dir?
[06:16] <crimsun> kyle__: you may need to mute 'External Amplifier' then
[06:17] <crimsun> kyle__: I have a meeting in 5 minutes, so I have to go.
[06:17] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Did you try the purge option?
[06:17] <freezey> na
[06:17] <freezey> so sudo apt-get remove -p apache2?
[06:17] <kyle__> crimsun: no problem, thank you though!
[06:17] <tonyyarusso> apt-get remove --purge apache2
[06:17] <tubbie> DBO, LOL
[06:17] <Intangir> hey guys, can you resize a partition, WITHOUT LOSING IT, before installing ubuntu?
[06:17] <tonyyarusso> Yeah, with sudo.
[06:17] <Intangir> during the installer?
[06:17] <ompaul> Question: what is driving "bind -v" to give the results it does
[06:17] <utilisateur> ibrashka
[06:18] <yggdrasil> how do i perform a search in a man page.. thought it was #
[06:18] <DBO> ompaul, good question...
[06:18] <NoUse> Intangir you can with gparted
[06:18] <freezey> yeah when i try to purge it it says its gone
[06:18] <XTF> unperson: Thanks. Is there no user-friendlier way to do this?
[06:18] <freezey> but /etc/apache2 still there
[06:18] <tonyyarusso> Intangir: If you have the empty space to do the resize without cutting into the data, sure.  Backups are always a good idea though of course.
[06:18] <kyle__> crimsun: YOU BEAUTY!  she worked!
[06:18] <kyle__> cheers all
[06:19] <Intangir> tonyyarusso: does it use gparted during the install ?
[06:19] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Well, I suppose you could just remove that then.
[06:19] <tonyyarusso> Intangir: No.
[06:19] <NoUse> !tell Intangir about gparted
[06:19] <tonyyarusso> (The install is text-based.)
[06:19] <squiddle> yggdrasil  it is /
[06:19] <freezey> tonyyarusso: with just a regular rmdir type shit
[06:19] <yggdrasil> squiddle thanks
[06:19] <unperson> XTF:  dpkg-reconfigure is actually not all THAT un-userfriendly, as I recall.
[06:19] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Yeah.
[06:20] <tonyyarusso> Intangir: You can use GParted from a live cd before the installer though.
[06:20] <Intangir> im running gparted right now
[06:20] <new_linux_usr> how do i stream asx files on linux?
[06:20] <freezey> tonyyarusso:whats that command to do when it tells ur dir not empty
[06:20] <Intangir> but i am just nervous cause its an old version in the debian repos
[06:20] <Intangir> i just told it to resize
[06:20] <unperson> XTF:  The problem is that the selection of possible resolutions is in the config file for the graphical user interface, so you sort of need to change it from outside the GUI.
[06:20] <Intangir> i hope its working right now.. doesnt seem to be saying it worked yet
[06:20] <DBO> ompaul, because the bind command you are refering to is not for BIND
[06:20] <squiddle> new_linux_usr  you can use vlc if it can read asx
[06:20] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Um, something like --ignore-error-on-non-empty.  check the man
=== para_away is now known as paradizelost
[06:21] <DBO> ompaul, the bind command allows you to change the editing keys, editing options, and make keyboard macros
[06:21] <unperson> XTF:  Once the resolution is in the list, then switching to it is easy as pie.
[06:21] <squiddle> ompaul  bind is a bash built-in
[06:21] <XTF> unperson: Why? IMO a GUI editor for that config shouldn't be impossible.
[06:21] <new_linux_usr> thanks
[06:21] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Ah, rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty (it's right at the top)
[06:22] <freezey> tonyyarusso: yeah that ignores it but its still there
[06:22] <cliebow_> anyone know hot ot lock down gdm to only icewm?
[06:22] <Intangir> i guess it ran.
[06:22] <Intangir> gonna reboot
[06:22] <unperson> XTF:  Well, you can certainly edit the config file from within the GUI, but you have to reset the GUI in order for changes to take effect.
[06:22] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Did you have sudo on the rmdir?
[06:23] <freezey> tonyyarusso: yeah
[06:23] <unperson> XTF:  And presumably you DON'T want somethning to go wrong mid-edit.
[06:23] <unperson> XTF:  The menu-driven interface of dpkg-reconfigure is really not too bad, though.  Just a little tedious.
[06:24] <tonyyarusso> freezey: Weird.  Try 'sudo rm -R /etc/apache2/* && sudo rmdir /etc/apache2' then.

[06:56] <XTF> rambo3: No. :( The system clock wasn't in GMT and NTP corrected the clock, which caused this error.
[06:57] <flossgeek> on Dapper I dont seem to be able to update from synaptic I get this when trying to install inkscape "http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapperRelease.gpg: Temporary failure resolving 'gb.archive.ubuntu.com'"
[06:57] <flossgeek> is it the gpg key
[06:58] <tubbie> is there any software like excel for Ubuntu other then the one from openoffice?

[06:59] <lalcaraz> Hi! I'm running on 5.10 but I want to upgrade Firefox and other stuff on the easy way, any help here??
[06:59] <Mysta_> I've loaded the linux-686-smp kernel, and my machine locks up as soon as I login to the Gnome. any ideas why this is happening
[06:59] <flossgeek> lalcaraz you could use automatix
[06:59] <DBO> no!
[06:59] <DBO> !automatix
[06:59] <ubotu> automatix is probably unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
[06:59] <tubbie> openoffice is too  slow
[06:59] <Firezip_> How come I can't download off of azurez?
[07:00] <hastesaver> flossgeek, don't ever do that again!
[07:00] <flossgeek> sorry

[07:00] <flossgeek> didnt realise

[07:02] <flossgeek> ok
[07:02] <Mysta_> Dr_Willis: have you seen my problem before??
[07:02] <rambo3> Mysta_, do you have hyperthreading processor or 2 processors?
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> Mysta_,  nope..   :P check the wiki/forums perhaps.
[07:03] <Mysta_> rambo: its a Dual Xeon 2.8
[07:04] <Mysta_> I have a thread on it on the forums if anyone wants to take a look
[07:04] <rambo3> Mysta_, do you have live cd?
[07:04] <Mysta_> yep
[07:05] <rambo3> why dont you boot it an check log files , mount /dev/* and check
[07:05] <Mysta_> so load the live cd, and mount dev/ from the base install?
[07:05] <mheath[laptop] > This isn't specifically Ubuntu related, but its related to Linux compatability with some buttons on my laptop...I was wondering if someone could provide some insight...
[07:05] <mheath[laptop] > the buttons on this laptop (the quick launch buttons) have lights in them....the Wireless-activation button light turns on when the wireless is on, and the mute button turns on when the sound is muted
=== beyond-rango is now known as beyond
[07:06] <mheath[laptop] > Someone raised the possibility that the lights were actually tied to the hardware
[07:06] <s|k> how do I upgrade mozilla? It's telling me there's an upgrade, but when I try dist-upgrade it says mozilla is held back
[07:06] <mheath[laptop] > IE, the light on the wireless button is actually tied TO the wireless card, and the light on the mutebutton is actually tied to the sound card
[07:06] <rambo3> Mysta_, yes
[07:06] <Mysta_> rambo3 ;what am i looking for in the logs
[07:06] <s|k> how do I upgrade mozilla? It's telling me there's an upgrade, but when I try dist-upgrade it says mozilla is held back
[07:06] <mheath[laptop] > in which case the lights would just work, no matter what OS I'm using. Can anyone comment on if this is actually the case or not?
[07:07] <rambo3> if its crashing in gnome look kernel log , dmesg and xorg logs . tail /var/log/  <-
[07:09] <rambo3> wiat x error is maby in /home/user/xsession-error
[07:09] <Mysta_> rambo3: just wondering why can't i just look through those logs while logged in w/o a live cd
[07:09] <rambo3> beacouse i told you to safe boot and you sad it confusing
[07:10] <Mysta_> lemme double check what you said then

[07:13] <lalcaraz> i'm sorry again, but I can't find the AUTOMATIX package ... maybe i'm looking at the wrong place .. can U help this guy??

[07:13] <ubotu> I heard automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.

[07:14] <ubotu> hmm... automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.

[07:38] <juliux> ompaul, no problem
[07:38] <g0dchild> All signs point to a prog called audacity
[07:38] <culix> ompaul, np
[07:38] <rambo3> Mysta_,  you can use 686 with no smp ,
[07:39] <Mysta_> rambo3: but I've got a Dual Xeon server, and its going to run vmware server
[07:39] <Mysta_> so i need all the power i can get
[07:39] <ompaul> ubuntu, have a look at System Administration Networking or  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
[07:39] <ubuntu> thankyou
[07:39] <Mysta_> if it doesn't work, i'll be using red hat :(
[07:39] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: dont do that :(
[07:39] <racestoapril1> does anyone know a konfabulator like program for ubuntu
[07:40] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: you need help w/ vmware?
[07:40] <ompaul> g0dchild, more helpful would be, I need a program that does function X, as most people don't know what adobe audition is
[07:40] <chavo> racestoapril1, gdesklets
[07:40] <Mysta_> hex: i dont want to, i will need help w/ vmware when i get smp working
[07:40] <racestoapril1> thanks
[07:40] <rambo3> Mysta_, then boot in dual ? you can use what ever 686 386 kernel you want
[07:40] <ompaul> !vmware
[07:40] <ubotu> Please check this out, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingVMWare adjusting kernel versions to your own, to get the number replace the numbers with " `uname -r" The ` is a Backtic
[07:40] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: is smp the current problem? or are you installing now?
[07:40] <Mysta_> hex: SMP is the current problem
[07:40] <ompaul> Mysta_, ^^  look up a couple of lines
[07:40] <rekrutacja> hi all i want to dsubmit a bug but this @#$%^&* bug buddy (its obviously a buddy f bugs, not users) wont send it unless i provide smething what it calls  "Path of sendmail"
[07:40] <Mysta_> thx ompaul, i saw it
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> !smp
[07:41] <ubotu> hmm... smp is Symmetric Multi Processing. The x86 architecture way of using multiple CPUs in one computer.
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> well, thanks ubotu
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> i guess i'll have to do it the old fashioned way

[07:42] <Corey> damn php make my head explode
[07:43] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: you had problems with sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp?
[07:43] <Hexidigital_> did you try installing using synaptic package manager, Mysta_ ?
[07:44] <Mysta_> HEX: with that problem i did use synaptic
[07:44] <Hexidigital_> what about aptitude?
[07:44] <Hexidigital_> sudo aptitude install linux-686-smp
[07:44] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: ^^
[07:45] <Mysta_> you mean sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp
[07:45] <Mysta_> ?
[07:45] <Hexidigital_> or aptitude
[07:45] <culix> i think smp is already installed, he has problems withe the x-server
[07:45] <Mysta_> isnt aptitude a commandline GUI interface?
[07:45] <Hexidigital_> culix:: perhaps he needs the 386-smp package?
[07:45] <culix> Mysta_, u can use it in both ways
[07:46] <Mysta_> but its a Dual Xeon 2.8 package

[07:47] <culix> Mysta_, sudo aptitude install linux-image-2.6.12-9-686-smp
[07:47] <rambo3> Mysta_, do you have fglrx driver since you have restricted modules. and gnome usualy doesnt start becouse of network problems
[07:48] <Ticondrius> no way...TomB?  EVE Online TomB?
[07:48] <culix> Mysta_, sry, sudo aptitude install linux-image-2.6.12-10-686-smp
[07:48] <Mysta_> culix: I'll try that now
[07:48] <conhe> need good sources.list
[07:48] <Mysta_> rambo: i'm not sure what fglrx driver is. I did see that ATI has new linux drivers today
[07:48] <Ticondrius> Anyone know the performance of a Radeon 7000 VE in Ubuntu with glx gears?
[07:48] <Mysta_> Ticon: I've got the same card in my server!
[07:49] <Ticondrius> I used to get around 1100FPS..but somehow It's running with some broken DRI now and I get like 550FPS...under Gentoo
[07:49] <Hexidigital_> culix:: won't that matter that he has a 386 kernel?
[07:49] <Mysta_> http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.25.18.html#
[07:49] <culix> Mysta_, does ubuntu runs in a vmware machine?
[07:49] <Ticondrius> Yes Culix
[07:49] <Ticondrius> Any OS does
[07:50] <Mysta_> culix: nope, brand new server brand new install
[07:50] <culix> Hexidigital_, if he has xeon he can use 686
[07:50] <Hexidigital_> i see
[07:50] <alexxx_ionutz> how do i restart xserver from terminal ?
[07:50] <Ticondrius> "startx"
[07:50] <alexxx_ionutz> ynx
[07:50] <culix> Ticondrius, i know, my question was if he installed it in a vmware machine
[07:50] <Ticondrius> ah..kk
[07:51] <rambo3> ctrl alt del
[07:51] <Ticondrius> I'm trying to find out if DRI for the xorg radeon driver is broken or not...
[07:51] <e-fonz> I want to copy files rom my personal folder to a password protected folder. can anyone give me an example of a commandline?
[07:51] <Mysta_> culix: did you get a chance to look at my thread?
[07:51] <Hexidigital_> rambo3:: ctrl alt del for what?
[07:51] <culix> Mysta_, yes, but it was not clear if you already use smp or not
[07:52] <Mysta_> ahh ok
[07:52] <Ticondrius> ..in ubuntui
[07:52] <Aeudian> for some reason i ahve apache 1 and apache 2 installed, how do i remove apache 1 with perl and ssh on my server cause apache 2 wont start
[07:52] <Mysta_> well everytime i try and boot into the 686 kernel it locks up, so right now the only kernel installed is 386
[07:52] <Ticondrius> Aeudian: It's better to nuke them both and reinstall the one you want
[07:53] <Aeudian> Ticondrius: how do i got about removing them
[07:53] <Ticondrius> Use the package manager in gnome?
[07:53] <Aeudian> i do not have a gui on my server.
[07:53] <culix> Mysta_, why does it locks up? faults?
[07:53] <Ticondrius> ah..then you need to use apt get
[07:53] <Ticondrius> which I dunno how to use, as I'm a Gentoo user
[07:54] <culix> Aeudian, aptitude purge apache

[07:57] <andrejkw> Ian_S: alien
[07:57] <Hexidigital_> Ticondrius:: i havent used html in years (i'm trying to get back into it)  :)
[07:57] <Ian_S> :o
[07:57] <Monkee13> Ian_S: I heard alien works pretty well
[07:57] <Ticondrius> Hexi: www.w3schools.com.  :)
[07:57] <Ticondrius> have fun!
[07:57] <Ian_S> alien?
[07:57] <ompaul> !alien
[07:57] <ubotu> I heard alien is a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
[07:57] <Ian_S> oh
[07:57] <culix> Mysta_, you have to figure out if the problem is the x-server or the wm
[07:57] <Hexidigital_> thx Ticondrius
[07:57] <NoUse> cr3 the headers don't need to match up exactly
[07:57] <andrejkw> Are there inbstructions anywhere on making your own APT repository?
[07:58] <Monkee13> best wouldbe to just compile the app yourself
[07:58] <Ian_S> Thanks :)
[07:58] <cr3> NoUse: thye do if I want to install vmware
[07:58] <Hexidigital_> Ticondrius:: is the man
[07:58] <ompaul> Ian_S, what app is it?
[07:58] <NoUse> cr3 no they don't :-)
[07:58] <Ian_S> ompual, its not in the apt directory if thats what you're asking :)
[07:58] <Mysta_> culix: im sorry but i wouldnt know where to begin trouble shooting that. did you notice that i changed the setting in xorg.conf from ati to radeon and it work for a while?
[07:59] <ompaul> andrejkw, it is on the wiki do a text search for "mirror"
[07:59] <Mysta_> culix: so thats lead me to believe its a driver problem w/ ATI
[07:59] <culix> Mysta_, so it seems to be a problem of the driver, did you try fglrx or vesa?
[07:59] <ompaul> Ian_S, we may know where there is a safe one
[07:59] <tomm7> hi ppl. the font in the menu for chosing a file to play in e.g. xmms or mplayer is pretty tiny - does anyone know what to change?
[07:59] <Ticondrius> wait wait...Mysta..what's happening?
[07:59] <Ticondrius> He locks up as soon as Gnome boots?
[07:59] <Mysta_> tico: yes
[07:59] <NoUse> cr3 just point it to the headers you have installed
[07:59] <Ticondrius> Check version of Mesa3D
[08:00] <Ian_S> ompaul, its Limewire, but do trust me its for completely legal purposes
[08:00] <Mysta_> culix: im not sure what you mean
[08:00] <Mysta_> tico: how?
[08:00] <ompaul> !limewire
[08:00] <ubotu> first you need !java, then download the http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and unpack it. Then just run the runLime.sh file. Voila. Consider !frostwire as an alternative.
[08:00] <Ticondrius> should be 6.5 or better...6.1 to 6.4 were very buggy with Radeons
[08:00] <Mysta_> ticondrius
[08:00] <Ticondrius> I do not know how in Ubuntu
[08:00] <Mysta_> urg
[08:00] <tomm7> i have xfonts-100dpi, xfonts-75dpi and xfonts-base installed
[08:00] <Ian_S> Ok thank you :)
[08:00] <cr3> NoUse: vmware expects a file called version.h which doesn't exist in the linux-kernel-source package

[08:01] <culix> Mysta_, do you need 3d acceleration?
[08:01] <Mysta_> well this server is going to be running vmware, so the guest machines may need it

[08:02] <culix> have to cook, my stomach is crying
[08:02] <Ticondrius> ompaul:  Nice trick
[08:02] <culix> Mysta_, yes, try it after installing 686-smp
[08:02] <andrejkw> ompul: nope, that only describes how to build.deb packages, I already have those. Now I want to build my own repository to publish them easily.
[08:03] <Mysta_> ompaul: WOW!!!!
[08:03] <Mysta_> ok thanks
[08:03] <racestoapril1> does anyone have the link to mounting an ipod mini 2nd gen on ubuntu 5.04?

[08:06] <diskofish> and it says it's installed by default on Dapper Drake , but no driver was installed
[08:06] <Seveas> heh
[08:06] <Seveas> ompaul, Falcon 1.0 will go gold in a few days
[08:07] <ompaul> Seveas, I don't need it before dapper is in :-)
[08:07] <Seveas> so for edgy I'm hoping to include it in ubuntu proper

[08:09] <TaTonka> would it run at a decent speed?
[08:09] <Seveas> will be released in hours
[08:09] <Ticondrius> Probably TatOnka..can't be sure without more detail of your hardware
[08:09] <Mysta_> culix: it doesnt seem that the ati drivers work w/ the Radeon 7000 ve. The wiki page says make sure you have a radeon 8500 or higher
[08:09] <Seveas> and just update regularly the coming days
[08:10] <Ticondrius> Mysta: The Aati drivers only wortk with radeon 8550s and up
[08:10] <ompaul> TaTonka, it would be faster if you installed xubuntu-desktop if your feeling stuck, get as much ram as you can for it (if possible)
[08:10] <TaTonka> yeah, ill go look at the details, brb
[08:10] <Ticondrius> 8500

[08:30] <wims> is it possible to do a dist-upgrade to change my OS from 64 bit to 32 bit  ?
[08:30] <roryy> izmaelis: i presume you mean 'sudo mount -a' ?
[08:30] <wims> or do i have to download the iso and format my partitions ?
[08:30] <Clint-> and when I couldn't get vmware working I was upset, however, I'm past that now, I tought myself how to fix linux-headers, and redo system :P
[08:30] <izmaelis> roryy, yes sorry for typo
[08:30] <Ticondrius> eh?  I have Vmware working fine..had no problems at all
[08:31] <Clint-> wims
[08:31] <roryy> izmaelis: hrm. i don't know what comes first, mounting or bringing up the network..
[08:31] <Clint-> its probably going to look at a 64 bit kernel image. o.o
[08:31] <LinuxJones> wims, amd64 is not worth the hastle
[08:31] <luquetto> exit
[08:31] <izmaelis> roryy, but everything was working just fine before recent updates

[08:32] <wims> i have 64 bit now, i realizied it wasn't worth the hassle, all kinds of packages wont work
[08:32] <Ticondrius> It's going to take a forced OS migration to a 64 bit OS to get 64 bit process to the norm
[08:32] <wims> so i guess i have to get the 32 bit iso
[08:32] <Ticondrius> like when we all got duped into migrating to Windows 95
[08:32] <Clint-> hey LinuxJones  :-)
[08:32] <FaQ`1> how do i download DirectDraw driver?
[08:32] <simon__> hastesaver yes i've read it but the problem is that the password i've given my user isn't the same as my the computer tells me but i don't have changed anything

[08:32] <LinuxJones> Clint-, hiya :)
[08:33] <Ticondrius> FaQ`1: There is no directX for Linux..you must use Wine
[08:33] <roryy> izmaelis: i'm not sure in that case, sorry.  You can look in your logs (/var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog for errors
[08:33] <hastesaver> simon__, you're using sudo or su? If you can login as normal user, then it means the password is right
[08:33] <ompaul> !sudo
[08:33] <ubotu> sudo is probably a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.

[08:34] <simon__> hastesaver su or sudo?? i am a n00b i have changed to linux from windows today
[08:34] <LinuxJones> wims, you don't have a seperate partition for /home ?
[08:35] <wims> LinuxJones,  nope, only one for boot and one for the rest
[08:35] <{alejandro}> wait should I take this to ubuntu+1
[08:35] <wims> is it possible to resize my / partition, then create a new one and mount /home at it ?
[08:35] <hastesaver> simon__, ok. Are you using Ubuntu now? So it means you logged in with a password?
[08:35] <FaQ`1> yes.. but when i try to open games with wine it says me that I need driver for DirectDraw.
[08:35] <roryy> FaQ`1: you probably need cedega
[08:35] <roryy> !tell FaQ`1 about cedega
[08:35] <simon__> hastesaver yes i'm using ubuntu now
[08:36] <hastesaver> simon__, ok, now what's the problem? :)

[08:38] <GnarusLeo> !firefox
[08:38] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje: to change a mac address, you have to replace the network card
[08:38] <echobinary> lotus: am curious why would need to change it
[08:38] <h3sp4wn> !mirror
[08:38] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje:  the address is hardwired in each card
[08:38] <ubotu> rumour has it, mirror is repository mirrors can be found through http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[08:38] <GnarusLeo> !firefox1.5
[08:38] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[08:38] <lotuspsychje> no ticondrius
[08:38] <krang> howdy how, i was just wondering how i permanently assign a static IP to a machine and turn off all that DHCP stuff that seems to be automatic
[08:38] <ompaul> meheren, very hard to do, if you don't need to don't do it. sudo apt-get remove --purge kde
[08:38] <echobinary> you can spoof a mac address, but i cant think of any practical purpose
[08:38] <lotuspsychje> there is a shell command
[08:38] <simon__> hastesaver  my password  is the same as the root but if i want to install  a programm the pc ask the password of the root i give then my password because i've not given a root pw then he tells me the pw is wrong
[08:38] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje: I think you mean an IP address...
[08:39] <lotuspsychje> ifconfig hw ethX xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
[08:39] <lotuspsychje> this seems to be the cmd
[08:39] <GnarusLeo> !ati

[08:39] <lotuspsychje> but it gives me an error
[08:39] <calamari_> hi
[08:39] <Ticondrius> because you can't change a hardwired address...only spoof it in your firewall
[08:39] <Ticondrius> you can change an IP address though
[08:39] <racestoapril1> hi, i'm having trouble getting gtkpod to read the iTunesdb on my ipod mini. i've followed the guide on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=103071&highlight=ipod+mini , however when i run gtkpod, it gives me the error'/media/ipod/iPod_Control/iTunes/iTunesDB' does not exist. Import aborted.
[08:39] <lotuspsychje> Ticondrius i can change it on xp with smac
[08:40] <echobinary> lotus: a mac address is hard coded into your network hardware
[08:40] <lotuspsychje> so it must be done on linux too right
[08:40] <Ticondrius> That would be a mac spoofer..and Linux != Windows
[08:40] <calamari_> anyone know of a program that can do a hard drive surface scan (to check for physical errors), like windows scandisk?
[08:40] <hastesaver> simon__, firstly, to install programs, you won't need the root password like that. You should install from the repositories if the program is available. What are you trying to install?
[08:40] <echobinary> think of it as the unchangable fingerprint of your network card itself
[08:40] <meheren> for some reason it syas that package kde is not installed!?
[08:40] <krang> echobinary: you could change a chip :-)
[08:40] <abhay> I cannot setup my wireless connection can somebody help me.. my laptop is toshiba... when I set up I can see the network but it dosn't connect
[08:40] <lotuspsychje> so smac can change it right
[08:40] <echobinary> thats much more patience than i have
[08:40] <echobinary> ha aha
[08:40] <krang> lol
[08:40] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje:  only while you're in windows
[08:41] <simon__> hastesaver i come again in a few minutes sorry
[08:41] <lotuspsychje> so no can do on linux?
[08:41] <echobinary> ive never tried
[08:41] <Ticondrius> not without spoofing it in the firewall ruleset

[08:41] <krang> I've only really used ifconfig before

[08:42] <lotuspsychje> Ticondrius:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address
[08:42] <nawre> Hi there
[08:42] <Ticondrius> racestoapril1: Sounds like something needs it's database generated
[08:42] <nawre> comin
[08:42] <racestoapril1> how would i go about doing that?
[08:42] <lotuspsychje> Under Linux, the MAC address of a Network Interface Card (NIC) can be changed by doing the following: (You must be root in order for this to work)
[08:42] <hastesaver> racestoapril1, go to Edit preferences, and check whether the mount point is set to /mnt/iPod or /media/iPod -- sometimes that's the only problem :)
[08:42] <nawre> in order to know the difference between ubuntu's server distro and standard one
[08:42] <racestoapril1> ok thanks
[08:43] <echobinary> i wonder if one day they will need MACv6
[08:43] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje:  nice...still, no real reason to bother
[08:43] <nawre> is it about packaging
[08:43] <Hexidigital_> why would you want to spoof your mac, and risk damaging your entire network configuration?
[08:43] <abhay> I cannot setup my wireless connection can somebody help me.. my laptop is toshiba... when I set up I can see the network but it dosn't connect dapper 7
[08:44] <lotuspsychje> Hexidigital_
[08:44] <echobinary> the only reason i can think of to spoof a mac is shady at best
[08:44] <lotuspsychje> what would you do when u get ddost
[08:44] <roryy> cos 0xDEADBEEF is a cool mac
[08:44] <Hexidigital_> echobinary:: i agree
[08:44] <echobinary> perhaps to mimic someone elses machine - say a laptop physically on someone else's network?
[08:44] <lotuspsychje> another ip= another person
[08:44] <abhay> I'm new to ubuntu and linux
[08:44] <Hexidigital_> lotuspsychje:: close ports on my system? or not open them, to begin with?
[08:44] <lotuspsychje> when is a person safe?
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> never
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> even on linux
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> you could harden your system
[08:45] <echobinary> thats what anonymous proxies are for :-D
[08:45] <Ticondrius> lotuspsychje:  a person is safe when you disconnect from the net.  :P
[08:45] <Crane> WHEN THE NETWORK CABLE IS UNPLUGED
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> lol
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> agree
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> hehe
[08:45] <lotuspsychje> so my way is to change mac adresses often
[08:45] <echobinary> for a safe computer i recommend comcast cable internet!
[08:46] <echobinary> err.. wait, was that outloud?
[08:46] <lotuspsychje> loool

[08:47] <calamari_> anyone know of a program that can do a hard drive surface scan (to check for physical errors), like windows scandisk?
[08:47] <echobinary> this isnt the commodore 64 room?
[08:47] <lotuspsychje> means off mac adress spoofing topic
[08:47] <Hexidigital_> calamari_:: fsck

[08:48] <Rubin> calamari_, your best bet is the disk manufacturers own test software, such as western digital's utility disk
[08:48] <Rubin> calamari_, they can do some tests via magic undocumented features noone else can
[08:48] <hastesaver> racestoapril1, has it worked before? Does the iPod already have stuff in it?
[08:48] <lotuspsychje> well i guess i'll have to find my way myself to change it
[08:48] <racestoapril1> yes

[08:49] <racestoapril1> hastesaver:^^
[08:49] <calamari_> ahh, I thought fsck only checked the filesyste.. didn't know it checked for bad sectors too
[08:49] <deadcake> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14636 please help me
[08:49] <calamari_> thanks
[08:49] <echobinary> it makes calls to badblocks

[08:50] <deadcake> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14636 please help me
[08:50] <roryy> echobinary: are you sure fsck calls badblocks ?
[08:50] <echobinary> does your card have two monitor outs?
[08:50] <hastesaver> racestoapril1, hmm, I don't know. You can try looking at the filesystem by hand, but I'm not sure what exactly... If you have the data backed up, you can also try File->Create directories or whatever
[08:50] <echobinary> im pretty sure
[08:51] <LinuxJones> meheren, ati released a new driver today >> http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.25.18.html

[08:51] <meheren> echobinary, and have them display different things like to extend my desktop onto one while having a degfault on the other monitor
[08:51] <meheren> \oh ok thx
[08:51] <roryy> ah, if you pass -c
[08:51] <echobinary> and the man page mentioned programs like fsck make calls to it in certain modes
[08:51] <deadcake> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14636 please help me

[08:53] <juhan> hi there, i'm having problems with the wireless. basically i can see the networks but i cannot connect. I'm using ndiswrapper but i asume that if i see the network means that the driver is working so is has to be something to do with the setup of teh network. Any ideas anyone?
[08:53] <echobinary> are you getting an IP?
[08:53] <juhan> no, echo is i set it with dhcp i get nothing
[08:54] <echobinary> hmmm
[08:54] <toby> bsdfox: i had same problem
[08:54] <bsdfox> juhan, no WEP/WPA?
[08:54] <echobinary> whats your AP?
[08:54] <juhan> it has wep
[08:54] <echobinary> can you run any diags on the AP to see if your AP can see the DHCP server?
[08:54] <toby> I just connected my monitors the other way round
[08:54] <bsdfox> juan, try without wep
[08:54] <bsdfox> toby, lame :(
[08:54] <juhan> echobinary how do i do that?
[08:54] <toby> very
[08:55] <echobinary> whats your AP?
[08:55] <toby> i spent ages trying
[08:55] <echobinary> <-- runs linksys with dd-wrt @ home
[08:55] <bsdfox> I'm convinced it's a nvidia bug.. I think it's cause the CRT powers up first
[08:55] <juhan> AP?
[08:55] <toby> i have all sorts of problems with my dual display
[08:55] <echobinary> you have a wireless signal transmitter, thats yoru AP, its what your other wireless dvices connect to
[08:55] <echobinary> for some its a wireless outer
[08:56] <echobinary> router*
[08:56] <h3sp4wn> echobinary: Why not openwrt ?
[08:56] <toby> I just want one screen for my projector and the other for everything else
[08:56] <toby> so i have the apart so my mouse stays in only one :)
[08:56] <bsdfox> toby: I have that working
[08:56] <echobinary> h3s: no real reason, path of least resistance for bridging to WRT54GS i found
[08:56] <echobinary> but i only spent 5 minutes looking into it
[08:56] <toby> but my 'task bar' is in the other and I can't get to it lol
[08:57] <echobinary> got tired of sveasoft
[08:57] <bsdfox> toby: I've got gnome setup where I have a taskbar/clock/everything on each monitor
[08:57] <toby> bsdfox how you do it ? not xinerama
[08:57] <bsdfox> but the mouse will still scroll between the two
[08:57] <juhan> I have a router but have no idea the model or anything

[08:57] <bsdfox> toby, nope
[08:58] <juhan> it used to work before i installed dapper
[08:58] <echobinary> juhan to help we need more info re: your wireless device and network setup
[08:58] <bsdfox> it's actually a damn nice setup.. but the GDM login screen only comes up on the CRT which I don't always want to use
[08:58] <elknof1> hi everybody
[08:58] <echobinary> well,me anyways, maybe not someone else ;)
[08:58] <toby> bsdfox don't really want the screen stuff (taskbars) on the other monitor
[08:58] <bsdfox> toby: you could configure it
[08:58] <toby> and I want fluxbox not gnome
[08:58] <echobinary> soudns liek you said you _can_ connect to the wireless but _not_ to your network
[08:58] <elknof1> does anyboy knows how to activate the dma of the dvd device??
[08:58] <bsdfox> toby, I'm sure fluxbox will work :P
[08:58] <echobinary> says to me that wireless auth is fine but the access point cant see the dhcp sever
[08:59] <toby> bsdfox: i know but it takes time I'm trying to build a juke box
[08:59] <bsdfox> each monitor has 4 workspaces, independant.. I can;t figure out how to move windows between the monitors (except gimp has a faciility for it)
[08:59] <roryy> !tell elknof1 about dma
[08:59] <bsdfox> toby, I think you want the setup I have right now
[08:59] <toby> bsdfox got flux box working but just not had the time to try it with both screens plus I think i'll wait for dapper
[09:00] <toby> bsdfox be good to have a look
[09:00] <bsdfox> I'll post my xorg.conf

[09:01] <juhan> well at least the wireless part
[09:01] <Some_Person> I can't resize my NTFS partition with GParted (on live cd)!
[09:01] <echobinary> *ponders*
[09:02] <toby> bsdfox to move you want xinerama but then you loose the independent desktops etc
[09:02] <echobinary> perhaps, you should be able to access the network settings in the system admin menu or something like that
[09:02] <GaiaX11> When I turn on the PC what can i do not to restore the previous session in ubuntu?

[09:04] <Some_Person> what is it?
[09:04] <toby> bsdfox ireally want my whole other screen as a seperate session so I can restart x on the other but I think i need to improve my skills a little first

[09:05] <echobinary> i noticed  :-D
[09:05] <echobinary> thanks for the tip!
[09:05] <Some_Person> i also already have a fat32 (came with computer)

[09:43] <NoUse> medeli1 thats where the deb is put when it is downloaded by apt-get or synaptic

[10:38] <ShadowShuriken> r0xoR, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d14642
[10:39] <graft> dts: first,y ou remember your old password. then, you use that to set a new one
[10:39] <r0xoR> dts, are we talking root password or user password?

[10:40] <stian> any norwegian here? need help
[10:41] <pike> LogicalDash: basically if your type ifconfig in command line it will display your network devices. one of mine is ath0 (my wireless card) the interfaces file on my computer has two lines for that devices 'auto ath0' and the next line 'iface ath0 inet dhcp'

[10:44] <graft> ShadowShuriken: just do sudo modprobe sis900, or sudo modprobe 8139too depending on which card you want to use
[10:44] <ShadowShuriken> tried it..
[10:44] <ShadowShuriken> doesnt work :(

[10:47] <talahan> Let me explain the situation, please.. hehe..
[10:47] <xzotick> does anyone know why i might now be able to access the tool, etc in firefox?
[10:47] <alexbligh> mmm... the answer seems to be "reboot and it recognizes it as a wireless card again"
[10:47] <pike> LogicalDash: add the line atho wlan0 I think that would do it
[10:47] <echobinary> LOL @ bash post
[10:47] <talahan> Well, lemme just ask, this room is crowded. :)
[10:47] <LogicalDash> pike, atho and not ath0?

[10:48] <pike> LogicalDash: auto wlan0 sorry
[10:48] <graft> GnarusLeo: use dpkg --contents, damnit
[10:48] <KenSentMe> synth: edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, go to section Screen, subsection display and add your desired resolution to modes
[10:48] <ShadowShuriken> graft, help...
[10:48] <echobinary> ..speaking of bash.org
[10:48] <Haydre> talahan:What brand of card is it? different drivers sometimes have different install scripts
[10:49] <echobinary> :-D
[10:49] <LogicalDash> pike, it already has that line.
[10:49] <graft> ShadowShuriken: i got nothing, man... what kernel image package did you install?
[10:49] <ShadowShuriken> graft, i didnt install anything...i just updated...w/e the notifier said..
[10:49] <talahan> It's a Matrox Millenium G450 and has an install.sh file.
[10:49] <GnarusLeo> how do I use dpg --contents?
[10:49] <talahan> Yes, yes, I need a new video card. My old one blew, this is my backup.

[10:49] <ShadowShuriken> GnarusLeo, type dpkg --contents in the terminal
[10:50] <Haydre> talahan:Have you tried running it from the terminal, or have you only tried double clicking on it?
[10:50] <echobinary> it is in /usr/src/linux-sourcexxx.tar.gz
[10:50] <talahan> I have only tried double clicking it. I do not know how to operate the terminal.

[10:50] <graft> ShadowShuriken: well, what did it upgrade your kernel to?
[10:50] <ShadowShuriken> from...2.6.12-9 to 2.6.12-10
[10:51] <ShadowShuriken> graft, 11 from...2.6.12-9 to 2.6.12-10
[10:51] <ShadowShuriken> remove the 11...
[10:51] <Haydre> talahan:Well, now seems like a good time to learn how to use it, you should learn how to use it, as some programs require you to at least understand how it works
[10:51] <pike> LogicalDash: oh.. if you sudo network-admin does it show the device as set to default?  other than that and maybe writing a little script to take it down ant then back up when comp boots im not sure
[10:51] <graft> ShadowShuriken: err. okay, and is there a /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-ubuntuwhatever directory?
[10:51] <talahan> Haydre: It looks similar to DOS which I'm quite familar with. Where do I get a list of basic commands?

[10:52] <GnarusLeo> Couldnt just anyone tell me I needed to download them? :D LOL!
[10:52] <graft> talahan: type that in the terminal
[10:52] <echobinary> how could we know that>?
[10:52] <echobinary> that is kinda funny though
[10:52] <pike> GnarusLeo: source isnt included by default you need to download it
[10:52] <zooy0rk> has anyone gotten their hands on a nforce5 board yet and tried it in linux?
[10:53] <echobinary> Ubuntu is a binary distro  - usually no need for source for compiles a.f.a.i.k. - but im a newbie here
[10:53] <graft> holy jesus
[10:53] <LogicalDash> pike, it says it's the default gateway device.
[10:53] <GnarusLeo> thanks pike :)
[10:53] <LogicalDash> I don't think it always says that when I boot.
[10:53] <synth> KenSentMe: how do i log on as root to edit xorg.conf?
[10:53] <Mortal`> synth, su
[10:53] <echobinary> i fine the repositories have everythign i need thus far
[10:53] <graft> you need source sometimes to build third-party drivers
[10:53] <KenSentMe> !root
[10:53] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[10:53] <VitaminG> echobinary: as long as the program is in the repositiories, yes. But source is still a great way to distribute programs
[10:53] <echobinary> yeah sometimes, i tried that with my nvidia drivers
[10:54] <synth> "sudo edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" ?
[10:54] <graft> synth: yeah, that
[10:54] <echobinary> amen to that
[10:54] <KenSentMe> synth: yep

[10:56] <rajeev> Blissex. how to config... it ,actually i m new in linux
[10:56] <stian> a full format on the hole disk
[10:57] <Mysta_> wont the ubuntu intall process erase everything and install ubuntu?
[10:57] <Mysta_> its done it for me
[10:57] <FliesLikeABrick> stian  just download the cd and follow the instructions when you boot it
[10:57] <Mysta_> so theres no need to format, it'll format for you when you follow the install process
[10:57] <Haydre> stian:I might be wrong, but I don't believe Breezy has the graphical install, you'll need to get an install CD if I'm correct
[10:57] <stian> I have 50 ubuntu cds home!

[10:57] <KenSentMe> Haydre: a live cd

[10:59] <Haydre> KenSentMe: I got that, but if he want's to actually install it, which My mistake, I thought he was formatting it to install ubuntu, in which case he would need an install CD
[10:59] <Haydre> KenSentMe: eek, ignore the first half of that sentence
[11:00] <KenSentMe> Haydre: One question about formatting. How do you format a hd in dapper using the menu?
[11:00] <echobinary> from live cd, what about #sudo cfdisk /dev/hda
[11:00] <echobinary> or whichever
[11:00] <ShadowShuriken> graft, yes there is a /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386 directory

[11:00] <titan> I want sound, but not ALSA.
[11:01] <Haydre> KenSentMe: I'm not sure, I havn't tried the Dapper Live Install, I'm not even sure if it's done yet
[11:01] <KenSentMe> Haydre: i don't mean the live cd. I've installed dapper, but i can't format the Windows partitions using the menu
[11:01] <KenSentMe> Haydre: the format option is disabled
[11:02] <echobinary> from command line #sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdd  (your hard drive partition number

[11:02] <themaan> how would I get a linux first class eqivilent that works
[11:02] <themaan> first class is a telnet thing
[11:02] <Haydre> KenSentMe: are the partitions mounted? I believe that would have an effect

[11:04] <eyedol> graft:oh ok thanks
[11:04] <ShadowShuriken> graft, u know why it doesnt work?
[11:04] <graft> themaan: "telnet server"?
[11:04] <themaan> well my school uses "First Class"
[11:04] <themaan> doesnt that use telnet
[11:04] <talahan> Hiya all again, I need more help :)
[11:04] <talahan> I browsed to an install.sh file with Terminal..
[11:04] <Haydre> themaan: telnet servernameorip portnumber
[11:04] <ShadowShuriken> graft, u know why it doesnt work?
[11:05] <ThinkMax> I've got a Ubuntu desktop and a ubuntu laptop, and I'm trying to get X windows to display from the desktop to the laptop. On the laptop I ran xhost +desktopip and on the desktop, I tried to run xfig -display=laptopip:0.0&, but the Desktop can't find it. They're both on a LAN with no firewalls, do you have any ideas?
[11:05] <talahan> And typed in install.. but do not know how to make the script run :)
[11:05] <themaan> which portnumebr should I use
[11:05] <themaan> 80?
[11:05] <Haydre> themaan: what port is the server being run on?
[11:05] <themaan> its my schools server
[11:05] <themaan> so I have no clue
[11:05] <graft> ShadowShuriken: um, i suspect it does
[11:05] <graft> ShadowShuriken: how are you trying to bring up your interface?
[11:05] <themaan> i know that its run on vufa.tdsb.on.ca
[11:05] <themaan> thats about it
[11:06] <ShadowShuriken> graft, what do u mean?
[11:06] <talahan>      /msg nickserv set unfiltered on
[11:06] <ThinkMax> is there something I need to do to my xorg.conf or something so that it will listen for incoming connections?
[11:06] <graft> ThinkMax: yeah, just use ssh with X11 forwarding, much easier
[11:06] <echobinar1> ...
[11:06] <Haydre> themaan: that sounds like it might be the servername
[11:06] <talahan> Anyone? :)
[11:06] <graft> ShadowShuriken: how do you get your ethernet to give you an ip address?
[11:06] <echobinar1> ..that was not the minimize button
[11:06] <igorzolnikov> echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[11:07] <ShadowShuriken> graft, it does it automatically..,
[11:07] <igorzolnikov> bash: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward: Permission denied
[11:07] <themaan> that might be it
[11:07] <themaan> it says that I am connected
[11:07] <graft> ThinkMax: probably oyu need to enable tcp listening to do what you want to do, but you can do it without by using an ssh tunnel
[11:07] <igorzolnikov> what is problem?
[11:07] <themaan> I am on port 80
[11:07] <themaan> ubt it doesnt give any login or anything
[11:07] <graft> ShadowShuriken: how? with networkmanager, or what?
[11:07] <KenSentMe> talahan: type./install.sh
[11:07] <talahan> I'm in Konsole and I'm trying to get an install.sh to run. What is the command for it? I've browsed to that directory.
[11:07] <talahan> Thank you KenSentMe ^^
[11:08] <igorzolnikov> echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

[11:08] <ShadowShuriken> graft, well...with...system > admin > networking..
[11:08] <igorzolnikov> what is problem?
[11:08] <ThinkMax> do you know how to enable listening (and won't it need to be listening anyway for a tunnel?)
[11:08] <themaan> any programs that are like firstclass?
[11:08] <graft> talahan: you should really read 'man intro'. but 'sh ./install.sh' will usually do it
[11:08] <KenSentMe> talahan: no problem
[11:08] <Haydre> themaan: I'm not familiar with the server, so I can't help you too much with it, you might want to ask someone who has already connected to the server
[11:08] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: use sudo
[11:08] <graft> ShadowShuriken: yeah that... what does that do now?
[11:08] <talahan> Ok, next question.. how do I log in as Root? :)
[11:08] <themaan> very few people at my school use linux
[11:08] <gnomefreak> talahan: sudo not su
[11:08] <igorzolnikov> equals result
[11:08] <themaan> its a small school
[11:08] <ShadowShuriken> graft, activates/deactivates the network connection
[11:08] <themaan> well I might find one
[11:09] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell talahan about sudo
[11:09] <ShadowShuriken> graft, i tried that but doesnt work...
[11:09] <themaan> actualy I know one
[11:09] <igorzolnikov> @ubuntu:~$ sudo echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[11:09] <igorzolnikov> bash: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward: Permission denied
[11:09] <graft> ShadowShuriken: urgh. i mean, can you see your network interface there?
[11:09] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: did you enable su?
[11:09] <themaan> Ill ask him
[11:09] <ShadowShuriken> graft, yes
[11:09] <graft> ShadowShuriken: does it have a listing?
[11:09] <talahan> graft: man intro gives me one page and no more, can't seem to switch to next page.
[11:09] <graft> talahan: try hitting the spacebar
[11:09] <gnomefreak> talahan: try pagedown
[11:09] <talahan> Sudu?
[11:09] <igorzolnikov> how i can enable su?
[11:09] <ShadowShuriken> graft, yes it shows eth0 and eth1

[11:09] <talahan> Oh, Feeling rather stupid today :)
[11:09] <ShadowShuriken> graft, but it wont connect..
[11:10] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: you dont want to
[11:10] <graft> ShadowShuriken: well, did you try both eth0 and eth1?
[11:10] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: thats why i asked
[11:10] <Haydre> themaan: Whether you connect from a Windows PC or a Linux box, telnet works exactly the same
[11:10] <ShadowShuriken> graft, yup
[11:10] <ShadowShuriken> graft, doesnt work
[11:10] <gnomefreak> pastebin the command you are trying to run and the ouput please
[11:10] <graft> ShadowShuriken: what error does it give?
[11:10] <gnomefreak> !pastebin
[11:10] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package]

[11:10] <themaan> well with windows there are programs
[11:10] <themaan> liek first class
[11:10] <themaan> and stuff like that
[11:11] <graft> ThinkMax: um... no, the tunnel doesn't need listening
[11:11] <themaan> and windows works dif
[11:11] <redguy> igorzolnikov: run sudo -i , it will give you a root shell
[11:11] <themaan> I htink
[11:11] <themaan> you type tell net
[11:11] <redguy> !enter
[11:11] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[11:11] <themaan> then it asks for server
[11:11] <themaan> tehn it asks for login
[11:11] <graft> ThinkMax: it creates a local X connection and forwards X traffic over the ssh connection
[11:11] <Subhuman> themaan, linux has telnet too..

[11:21] <TimeGap> thats a south-african version of linux aint it?
[11:21] <ShadowShuriken> graft, whats ipv6?
[11:21] <talahan> Thank you
[11:21] <Mortal`> What's the difference between su and sudo?
[11:22] <ShadowShuriken> Mortal
[11:22] <redguy> Mortal`: sudo works in the default ubuntu unstallation, su doesn't
[11:22] <talahan> Ok, I logged in as root, but the file I'm trying to install is not accessable.
[11:22] <Manika> Mortal`: sudo makes root privileges available only for the session you're running at the moment
[11:22] <talahan> Do I need to drop that file into root?
[11:22] <kermit> sudo su - works though.
[11:22] <Flannel> Mortal`: sudo keeps logs of everything,
[11:22] <ShadowShuriken> graft, whats ipv6?
[11:22] <Mortal`> Okay, thanks, guy
[11:22] <Mortal`> guys*
[11:23] <graft> ShadowShuriken: um. it's like ipv4, but it's ipv6

[11:23] <lufis> Hi. I messed up my grub menu.lst file and need to restore it, but I can't get into a command line and i can't edit it using a livecd. What should i do?
[11:23] <graft> ShadowShuriken: it's the next generation of the IP system
[11:23] <Flannel> ShadowShuriken: IPv6 (IP verson 6) your ip address is a lot longer.  instead of the usual four digit one.
[11:23] <orbin> Mortal`: pong. just searched the forum...doesn't seem to be much...
[11:23] <talahan> Anyone? How do I access the file I'm trying to install from root? :)
[11:23] <Flannel> lufis: why can't you edit it from the liveCD?
[11:23] <somerville32> lufis: You can edit it in a livecd. You just need to mount your hard drive
[11:23] <redguy> talahan: does root own the file?
[11:23] <disinterested_pe> i cant read my wma dvds cause i cant get realplayer codecs installed
[11:23] <talahan> redguy I can't tell you that, how do I know?
[11:23] <lufis> Sommer, ok
[11:24] <redguy> talahan: what are you trying to install anyway?
[11:24] <Mortal`> orbin, I searched Synaptic, although I haven't found anything useful, the only mixer I found was a project that was closed years ago...

[11:48] <GnarusLeo> thanks gnomefreak
[11:48] <Gambaroni> When i logon to ubuntu it is just a black screen, and nothing happens?
[11:48] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: the very first line put a # in the beginning of it
[11:48] <KenSentMe> Gambaroni: has it worked before?
[11:49] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: not done yet either but let me know when you got that
[11:49] <GnarusLeo> gnomefreak, ok, give me a sex

[11:49] <GnarusLeo> ok, done gnomefreak
[11:49] <igorzolnikov> i have problem...
[11:49] <hyphenated> GnarusLeo: put 'universe' and 'multiverse' on your 'breezy-updates' lines too
[11:49] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: now the lines that end in universe add a space and add word multiverse
[11:50] <igorzolnikov> i click Add Applications... but don't show window with apps
[11:50] <KenSentMe> Gambaroni: does it immediately turn black after the bootloader (grub), or do you see descriptions to show that ubuntu is starting up?
[11:50] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: there are 5 in total
[11:50] <GnarusLeo> ok, done, gnomefreak
[11:50] <gnomefreak> save it and close it GnarusLeo
[11:50] <GnarusLeo> yep gnomefreak
[11:50] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: in terminal type sudo apt-get update
[11:50] <Gambaroni> KenSentMe yes, i can login too with username and password
[11:51] <gnomefreak> GnarusLeo: than you can install the package
[11:51] <Jowi> Gambaroni: if you at least get to the login window (gdm) then your xserver is at least configured correctly.

[11:53] <kasemodz> hey i have two nics going to two different routers. The problem is on gnome the netowrking configuration the default gateway device always remains eth2, no matter what... i want it to be eth0, i can select it and click ok. but when i come back it goes back to eth2. is there a manual way to do this?
[11:53] <Jowi> Gambaroni: does it work if you manually chose "gnome" from the session list in the login window?
=== mabus is now known as mabus06
[11:54] <Gambaroni> Jowi havent test that..
[11:54] <Jowi> Gambaroni: ...maybe the default is not set to gnome. you should at least get an error...
[11:55] <ShadowShuriken> gnomefreak, styll cant connect to the net
[11:55] <igorzolnikov> Add Applications... don't open... plz help me

[11:56] <kasemodz> hey i have two nics going to two different routers. The problem is on gnome the netowrking configuration the default gateway device always remains eth2, no matter what... i want it to be eth0, i can select it and click ok. but when i come back it goes back to eth2. is there a manual way to do this? anybody plz??
[11:56] <ShadowShuriken> gnomefreak, styll cant connect to the net
[11:56] <Rubin> kasemodz, edit /etc/network/interfaces (and read its man page) for advanced network configurations
[11:56] <Gambaroni> Jowi do i need to logon with root the first time?
[11:56] <Jowi> Gambaroni: since you get a login screen at least we know that X is set up correctly. the login screen (gdm) should launch gnome by default when you type in your login info. if it doesn't, there might be a fault with gnome. but try to chose it from the list first to see if that works.
[11:57] <Jowi> Gambaroni: root will not work. use your normal user that you set up
[11:57] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, need help for my net connection setup...can u help?
[11:57] <petrik> Where can I find a good explanation on how the ubuntu file systems works? How best to work with partitions/drives and moving some of the critical files accross such as programs and everyday data
[11:57] <NoUse> igorzolnikov run 'gksudo gnome-app-install' from a console
[11:57] <Mortal`> How do I do a "make"? I get "Command not found" :S
[11:57] <Gambaroni> Jowi i tried to use that user.. Okey how do i choose that?
[11:57] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, ?
[11:58] <Subhuman> Mortal`, you need the build-essential package
[11:58] <Jowi> Gambaroni: just chose "gnome" from the session list. type in the username and password. that's it.

[11:58] <Subhuman> Mortal`, "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
[11:58] <NoUse> igorzolnikov don't paste in here!
[11:58] <Jowi> ubotu: tell igorzolnikov about pastebin
[11:58] <Mortal`> Hehe, thanks Subhuman / NoUse / Subhuman
[11:59] <Jowi> Gambaroni: root can not log in with gdm. it is disabled even if you have created a root user (this option can be changed).
[11:59] <NoUse> igorzolnikov sudo apt-get --reinstall install libxt6 and try again
[11:59] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, you'll need to troubleshoot it. start at the begining with the device being detected, then see that it has a proper ip and all that
[11:59] <kasemodz> rubin whats the man page for the interfaces called
[12:00] <Rubin> kasemodz, i _think_ its just man interfaces
[12:00] <kasemodz> k
[12:00] <Gambaroni> Jowi Ok.. How do i choose from the list then? Where and how?
[12:00] <Rubin> kasemodz, also see 'ifup' and 'ifdown' which reads that file and brings the named interfaces up/down
[12:00] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, i turned ipv6 off...and it styll doesnt show any ip...
[12:01] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, eth0?
[12:01] <forn_> i use apt-get install gcc and it says its installed but i cant 'make' not even from root
[12:01] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, it detects the device and everything...but wont connect
[12:01] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, yup
[12:01] <NoUse> !tell forn_ about b-e
[12:01] <forn_> ty
[12:01] <Jowi> Gambaroni: when you get the login screen, there is should be a "session" button in there. when you say you can log in, do you get a graphical login (gdm) or just a basic text login (console)?
[12:02] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, you get your config via DHCP?
[12:02] <forn_> ty very much nouse
[12:02] <NoUse> forn_ np
[12:02] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, yup
[12:02] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, any firewall (iptables rules) loaded?
[12:02] <lufis> Hi. I installed runit and messed up my grub menu.lst file. I managed to restore it, but still the booting process freezes up. What gives?
[12:03] <jazzido> Hi. I've installed postgresql-contrib to get the pgcrypto functions, but seems that the .so isn't being loaded by the postgres daemon. Any clue?
[12:03] <Rubin> lufis, try sudo update-grub
[12:03] <lufis> Rubin, I can't get into my system so i can't use the command line
[12:03] <Rubin> lufis, live/rescue cd :)
[12:03] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d14648
[12:03] <Gambaroni> Jowi graphical
[12:03] <jcole> lufis: where does it freeze?
[12:03] <lufis> Rubin, i'm on a ubuntu livecd now, but i dont know how to fix it
[12:03] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, i use a router...
[12:04] <Jowi> Gambaroni: then you should not have a problem chosing gnome as a session
[12:04] <lufis> Jcole, it says something like "entering runit mode", or something like that. It stays that way
[12:04] <Rubin> ugh
[12:04] <kasemodz> hmm rubin i checked the man pages, there doesnt seem to be any option to make eth0 default
[12:04] <jcole> lufis: are you usind lvm/raid or something exotic like that?
[12:04] <Gambaroni> Jowi ok, on the session button?
[12:04] <Rubin> paste.ubuntu-nl.org is broken, mime type caused firefox to try to download the page instead of display it :/
[12:04] <Jowi> Gambaroni: yes
[12:05] <lufis> Jcole, no.
[12:05] <Rubin> kasemodz, when you define the interfaces in there, you put 'gateway' into eth eth0, but not into the other.
[12:05] <igorzolnikov> equals problem... with opening App Applications
[12:05] <NoUse> igorzolnikov did you try what I sent you?
[12:05] <Gambaroni> Jowi after i have choosen gnome on the session button? Do i logon then?
[12:05] <igorzolnikov> yes
[12:05] <jcole> lufis: do a "sudo -s" and an "fdisk -l" to find your root partition
[12:05] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, a simple NO would have worked heh
[12:06] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, so, whats 'ifup eth0' do?
[12:06] <Jowi> Gambaroni: yes. with the normal username and password (not "root")
[12:06] <igorzolnikov> also... don't open Firefox 1.0.8
[12:06] <NoUse> igorzolnikov some problem?
[12:06] <NoUse> igorzolnikov same*
[12:06] <Gambaroni> Jowi okey.. But do i need to choose gnome on the session button every time then?
[12:06] <claudio> bonsoir
[12:06] <lufis> Rubin, I know what my root partition is. The problem is I don't know how to get into command line or how to fix the problem. do you think installing runit would break everything?
[12:06] <NoUse> igorzolnikov did you change something on your machine?
[12:06] <igorzolnikov> /usr/lib/gnome-app-install/AppInstall.py:196: GtkWarning: gtk_accel_label_set_accel_closure: assertion `gtk_accel_group_from_accel_closure (accel_closure) != NULL' failed
[12:06] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, no clue man...i'm new to it...:(
[12:06] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, i just wanna get my net working thats all :(
[12:06] <NoUse> igorzolnikov pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:07] <NoUse> !tell igorzolnikov about pastebin
[12:07] <Jowi> Gambaroni: You should not have to.
[12:07] <Rubin> lufis, get a shell prompt, you can use tools like 'fdisk' to look at the hard disk. (eg, for ide: fdisk -l /dev/hda (or hdb etc)
[12:07] <Gambaroni> Jowi ok, just the first time?
[12:07] <forn_> is there any easy way to install drivers in ubuntu?
[12:07] <NoUse> forn_ what kind of drivers?
[12:07] <igorzolnikov> what is pastebin?
[12:07] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, run: sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0  and put the output into pastebin
[12:07] <jcole> lufis: mkdir myroot; mount /dev/hda1 myroot; mount -o bind /dev myroot/dev; mount -t proc /proc myroot/proc; chroot myroot
[12:07] <NoUse> igorzolnikov ubotu sent you a message about it
[12:08] <Jowi> Gambaroni: you shouldn't have to even the first time. but try it anyway
[12:08] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, ok
[12:08] <forn_> for my intel 2200 bg wireless card
[12:08] <petrik> How do you gert to the pastebin again? Have something there I would like someone to look at
[12:08] <NoUse> !tell forn_ about wireless
[12:08] <igorzolnikov> i see
[12:08] <forn_> sweet
[12:08] <forn_> ty again
[12:08] <lufis> Rubin, I don't know how to fix it though. I followed these instructions: http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/05/03/2126252&from=rss  and only did the first two steps. I restored the grub menu.lst file but it still doesn't work. Could just installing runit break grub?
[12:08] <jcole> lufis: ^^ that'll get you inside your other ubuntu... you may need to "mount /boot" when in the chroot if you created a separate partition for your kernel during install
[12:09] <Jowi> !tell petrik about pastebin
[12:09] <Rubin> lufis, i dont know what runit is, and im sorry i don't know how exactly to do the equiv of update-grub from a livecd
[12:09] <daxxar> How can I get ubuntu to think BIOS-time (hw time) is actually timezone adjusted, and not readjust it?
[12:09] <Jazznite> Needd help onmy DVD instalation
[12:09] <jcole> lufis: "grub-install" should configure grub for you
[12:09] <stian> --> Hey, anyone here can say me how to start X in ubuntu? <--

[12:10] <nickrud> stian, either sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start, or echo gnome-session > .xinitrc && startx
[12:10] <Rubin> Jazznite, try asking a specific question
[12:10] <Gambaroni> Jowi ok, thanks... But if it dont work what do i do then?
[12:11] <Jowi> Gambaroni: no idea :)
[12:11] <Gambaroni> Okej :P
[12:11] <stian> Thanks, but i get command not found
[12:11] <Jazznite> OK I have UBBTU 5.10 and my DVD dont work
[12:11] <petrik> Thanks Jowi
[12:11] <W_Irving> is my arp cache supposed to be empty?
[12:11] <nickrud> stian, which command?
[12:11] <Rubin> Jazznite, even more specific :)  (dont work?)
[12:11] <Jowi> ubotu: tell Jazznite about dvd
[12:11] <Jazznite> dont read DVD's at all
[12:11] <Mortal`> How do I enable Full duplex in aRts? Or at least, how do I find this "KDE Control Center"? This guide says "KDE Control Center | Sound & Multimedia | Sound System on Hardware tab there should be a Full duplex option, set it to on ("[x] "), then restart aRts and Skype."
[12:11] <petrik> Can anyone help me with this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14622
[12:12] <stian> sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
[12:12] <disinterested_pe> jazznite install realplayer 10
[12:12] <nickrud> stian, then you did a server install?
[12:12] <DarkED> Mortal`: i believe you go into the sound mixer in gnome
[12:12] <stian> nickrud: yes :)
[12:12] <DarkED> Mortal`: erm, nope
[12:12] <Jazznite> real player 10 in UBUNTU??
[12:12] <nickrud> stian, ok. which desktop do you want to run, kde, gnome, or xfce? or another?
[12:12] <disinterested_pe> yes
[12:13] <disinterested_pe> in synaptic m,gr
[12:13] <stian> nickrud: i love kde ;)
[12:13] <nickrud> stian, if you're on a good broadband, sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop, that pulls in all of kde & some other goodies.
[12:13] <Rubin> petrik, sounds like maybe your kernel modules arnt installed properly, so there was no /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/ like there was supposed to be?
[12:13] <Gambaroni> Jowi could it be the screen resolution? Because it is a laptop, and an old one..
[12:14] <stian> ok 5Mbit download connection should be ok?
[12:14] <Mortal`> How do I enable Full duplex in aRts? Or at least, how do I find this "KDE Control Center"? This guide says "KDE Control Center | Sound & Multimedia | Sound System on Hardware tab there should be a Full duplex option, set it to on ("[x] "), then restart aRts and Skype."

[12:15] <HolySavior> has anyone got frostwire working on their computer? i got it on the menu but when i click it to run the program nothing happenes anyone got any ideas?
[12:15] <Jazznite> on my DBVD problem
[12:15] <iwkse> hi all...i wanted to ask: ubuntu installs kernel-sources by default?
[12:15] <minimec> petrik: Remember: you must have read/write access to your kernel source tree. Do you have that ?
[12:15] <nickrud> HolySavior, did you install java?
[12:15] <Rubin> Jazznite, sorry mate, i dont know
[12:15] <Samuli^> HolySavior, do you have java?
[12:15] <petrik> Rubin, How would I go about fixing that? I guess I'm on the right track with what I'm doing there then
[12:15] <Jowi> Gambaroni: You can probably answer that yourself; Question, you get a loginscreen and it look ok?
[12:15] <stian> nickrud: how to start desktop now? :D
[12:15] <nickrud> stian, sudo /etc/init.d/kdm start
[12:15] <petrik> minimec, How do I do that?
[12:15] <Rubin> petrik, im not sure what your doing, or if your on the right track. just judging from the "make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/build: No such file or directory.  Stop."
[12:16] <HolySavior> i followed of the instructions on the forums and it links to a Java thing some sudo thing  and it ran but nothing happened
[12:16] <minimec> petrik: Are the kernel sources installed?
[12:16] <Gambaroni> Jowi yes
[12:16] <Jazznite> disinterested_pe, can you help me whit my DVD problem??
[12:16] <tubbie> i wish gnome can make window mong easier
[12:16] <stian> nickrud: I get command not found
[12:16] <nickrud> HolySavior, type in a terminal, java -version. You should be able to see what java version you're running
[12:16] <Samuli^> HolySavior, might be that you don't have right repositories enable.
[12:16] <Gambaroni> Jowi but isnt it other settings in gnome than gdm?
[12:16] <tubbie> moving*
[12:16] <disinterested_pe> i think so jazznite
[12:16] <nickrud> stian, if you installed kubuntu-desktop, you have kdm

[12:17] <forn_> what command can i use to check the current version driver i have installed for my wireless card?
[12:17] <disinterested_pe> system admin synaptic pkg mgr
[12:17] <xanavim> is there a way to grab files from the repo by date?
[12:17] <Rubin> petrik, what is it you are installing, exactly?
[12:17] <stian> nickrud: I get can`t find kubuntu-desktop
[12:18] <minimec> petrik: ok. So tell me, why do you go straight into the heart of the system?
[12:18] <nickrud> stian, then your sources are not good, see repos below
[12:18] <nickrud> !repos
[12:18] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[12:18] <Jowi> Gambaroni: at the moment you are not even getting into gnome. gnome is a desktop environment. gdm is a display manager. different things.
[12:18] <Rubin> forn_, drivers in linux (most of them) are not like windows.. they come with the linux kernel. so in most cases your question doesnt really make sense
[12:18] <forn_> what command can i use to check the current version driver i have installed for my wireless card?
[12:18] <nickrud> stian, copy the correct paste.ubuntu-nl.org file into /etc/apt/sources.list, then type sudo apt-get update & try again
[12:18] <Jowi> Gambaroni: just try it. no use discussing it further until you at least can log in properly
[12:19] <petrik> Rubin, What I belevie is some drivers for webcams in a hope to get mine going. At the moment it freezes the system as soon as I try to turn it on
[12:19] <farous> anyone know how to report a  bug

[12:21] <farous> Jazznite: follow ubotu link
[12:22] <minimec> ok. Your kernel is called linux-image-2.6.xx.deb. you will find a package with linux-image-source package with it. install that. you need that to configure and compile your new kernel.
[12:22] <nickrud> Jazznite, heh, us oldsters need to stick together, what dvd issue :)
[12:22] <farous> Jazznite: if it is a movie it that you did not make yourself it is most probably encrypted
[12:22] <HymnToLife> Jazznite> please describe the problem more precisely, is it a video DVD you want to play ?
[12:22] <disinterested_pe> jazznite go here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats

[12:25] <HaIx> Rubin, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d14649
[12:25] <petrik> minimec, Is that on the machine somewhere or in the repos?
[12:25] <stian> nickrud: I try, need to install gedit first. I use "apt-get install gedit"
[12:26] <nickrud> stian, eh, brain fart on my part, sorry I forgot you didn't have a desktop
[12:26] <stian> =)
[12:26] <HaIx> Rubin, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d14651
[12:26] <nickrud> stian, hm.
[12:26] <Rubin> HaIx, thats it from ifup eth0? it should either tell you it got an IP or retry a bunch of times
[12:27] <Rubin> HaIx, ahh k
[12:27] <nickrud> !javadebs
[12:27] <ubotu> In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-java5-jre is in multiverse
[12:27] <Rubin> HaIx, so it sounds like its having trouble contacting the DHCP server
[12:27] <twitch> does anyone know anything about repos??
[12:27] <nickrud> oh, javadebs sucks now
[12:27] <HaIx> Rubin, what can i do abt it?
[12:27] <stian> :p
[12:27] <erik_m> can anyone help with forwarding ports in iptables using CLI
[12:27] <Mortal`> How do I set aRts to use full duplex?
[12:27] <Rubin> HaIx, i'v seen that caused by unplugged cables (or bad cables) or the router needing a reboot
[12:27] <minimec> petrik: I don't think you shoul do what you want to do... I don't knoe if you know enough about debian and ubuntu.
[12:28] <HaIx> Rubin, but it works perfectly in windows :S
[12:28] <xanavim> I'm trying to do a dist-upgrade, and I says I need to enable to APT::Force-LoopBreak option.  How do I do this?
[12:28] <HaIx> i'm doing dual boot and its workin fine on window
[12:28] <nickrud> stian, I assume you're using a windows machine to chate?
[12:28] <HaIx> Rubin, i'm doing dual boot and its workin fine on window
[12:28] <stian> nickrud: yes
[12:28] <nickrud> twitch, I know sources well, but if you don't show me yours, I can't help
[12:28] <Rubin> HaIx, interesting. it could be that the router's DHCP server requires something that the linux DHCP client isnt providing, like a computer name
[12:28] <tola> I'm confused by the term "release candidate" - is Dapper here or not?
[12:28] <Rubin> HaIx, what kind of router is it?
[12:28] <petrik> minimec, You're right but at worst I will just need to start from scratch. I've only just installed so there's no huge loss there, only time
[12:28] <HaIx> Rubin, Linksys
[12:28] <nickrud> stian, then which release are you using? 5.10?
[12:28] <xanavim> tola: release candidate is right before a final release
[12:29] <tola> The announcement recommends everyone upgrades
[12:29] <HaIx> Rubin, Linksys BEFW11S4
[12:29] <tola> xanavim: ah ok
[12:29] <enyc> meep
[12:29] <Rubin> HaIx, you double-checked that windows works just now?
[12:29] <stian> nickrud: yes Ubuntu for PC 5.10 breeze
[12:29] <minimec> petrik: normally the kernels are pretty well preconfigured. So you must have some quiet spacial hardware or another strange problem.
[12:29] <HaIx> Rubin, i am using windows rite now :P
[12:30] <nickrud> !repos
[12:30] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[12:30] <Rubin> HaIx, ok. do you have more than one network card?
[12:30] <HaIx> Rubin, yup
[12:30] <Rubin> HaIx, ahh ha, how do you know 'eth0' is the correct one?
[12:30] <HaIx> Rubin, but it worked fine b4 the update...
[12:30] <HaIx> eth0 is onboard...
[12:30] <Rubin> HaIx, yes, but maybe eth0 and eth1 got swapped around
[12:30] <andrejkw> Hey guys
[12:30] <petrik> minimec, Besides you need to learn somehow. Maybe I should wait for Dapper and hope that resolves it
[12:30] <HaIx> eth1 is onboard...
[12:30] <Rubin> are you sure?
[12:30] <HaIx> hmm...
[12:30] <blaze> when i try to use ./configure i get the mistake: checking kernel source directory... Not found
[12:30] <blaze> what should i do?
[12:30] <HaIx> Rubin, hmm
[12:30] <farous> thanx nickrud its gread that i used my same username and password that i have on the forums
[12:31] <W_Irving> would someone walk me through the steps of compiling wpasupplicant?
[12:31] <ihaveavirus> hi guys
[12:31] <ihaveavirus> gals
[12:31] <nickrud> stian, go to  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 then in your linux console, logged in as root, type nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list and replace whatever is there with the contents of that web page
[12:31] <Haydre> Has anyone gotten the latest ATI Proprietary drivers installed? (8.25.18) I've been having quite a bit of difficulty getting them.
[12:31] <andrejkw> perlcc output executables cause "Segmentation fault" if I use "use Gtk2;", anyone know whats going on?
[12:31] <Rubin> HaIx, eth0 is whichever driver loads first.. so those arnt guaranteed to be the same across diff kernel configs
[12:31] <HaIx> Rubin, o ok..
[12:31] <HaIx> Rubin, so remove the other nic?
[12:31] <nickrud> farous, yeah, they are all the same. I had serious problems with that, it's good it worked for you :)
[12:31] <Rubin> HaIx, quick fix, edit /etc/network/interface and change all the eth0 to eth1
[12:31] <Rubin> HaIx, then do ifup eth1
[12:32] <HaIx> Rubin, ok..
[12:32] <ihaveavirus> when you download the alsa source off apt what directory does it go in
[12:32] <ihaveavirus> ?
[12:32] <blaze> when i try to use ./configure i get the mistake: checking kernel source directory... Not found
[12:32] <blaze> what should i do :) ?
[12:32] <andrejkw> anyone?
[12:32] <HaIx> Rubin, k be back in a jiffy :)
[12:32] <lmiranda> hola
[12:32] <lmiranda> hola
[12:32] <miranda82> does anyone know, where is screensvaer manager in dapper?
[12:32] <Manika> my mobile phone is not accepting the PIN code I entered in the bluetooth config file... how should I proceed?
[12:32] <ihaveavirus> blaze,  did you install the kernel source?
[12:33] <stian> nickrud: ok, i try
[12:33] <nickrud> ihaveavirus, a useful tool is dpkg -L <package name> it lists all the files in the package & their location
[12:33] <minimec> petrik: You have to install the sources with 'sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.xx.sources.deb' or with 'sudo synaptic'
[12:33] <lmiranda> internet is very slow in ubuntu... can anyone help me ???
[12:33] <Rubin> miranda82, should be right there in system -> prefs
[12:33] <ihaveavirus> thanks nickrud :D;)
[12:33] <nickrud> stian, you have high bandwidth, it might be simpler to download the kubuntu desktop
[12:33] <miranda82> Rubin, that's the point i haven't got it
[12:33] <blaze> no ihaveavirus i haven't
[12:33] <Rubin> miranda82, maybe it isnt installed. try apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[12:33] <petrik> minimec, Another goal is to get some of my directories moved to other partions and drives. That also is going to require some research into linux filesystem structure
[12:33] <ihaveavirus> do that first blaze
[12:33] <nickrud> stian, CD I mean
[12:34] <Haydre> I had the ATI 8.24 drivers working, but the latest came out, and I am missing a shared library, libfglrx_pp.so.1 so they won't run, any ideas on how to fix it?
[12:34] <ihaveavirus> then try ./conifugure
[12:34] <blaze> how to? :)
[12:34] <lmiranda> internet is very slow in ubuntu... can anyone help me ???
[12:34] <Rubin> petrik, you should avoid that stuff until you are really good with linux IMO
[12:34] <miranda82> Rubin, I installed from flight cd 6
[12:34] <stian> nickrud: download and burn on a cd?
[12:34] <nickrud> stian, exactly
[12:34] <HymnToLife> lmiranda> what kind of intrnet ?
[12:34] <ihaveavirus> open up synaptic and search linux blaze
[12:34] <Rubin> miranda82, i installed flight7 yesterday and it was there, so i dunno
[12:34] <blaze> ok, ihaveavirus
[12:34] <petrik> Rubin, How do you become good at it if you don't do these things?
[12:34] <blaze> kernel-source*
[12:34] <blaze> right ihaveavirus ?
[12:34] <stian> nickrud: i have no cdburne right now:/
[12:35] <Rubin> petrik, baby steps
[12:35] <Jazznite> OK merci,gracias,thanks, but how i get to TYPING IN TERMINAL??
[12:35] <Rubin> petrik, you dont even really unedrstand what SHOULD be on its own partitions and things until you have used it a while
[12:35] <miranda82> Rubin, do u know what is the process called?
[12:35] <lmiranda> dont need a username and password ... always connected
[12:35] <HymnToLife> !tell Jazznite about cli
[12:35] <Manika> my mobile phone is not accepting the PIN code I entered in the bluetooth config file... how should I proceed?
[12:35] <lmiranda> dhcp ?
[12:35] <Rubin> petrik, read a lot, and explore your filesystem, figure out what everything in /usr/bin does, for example. read about what /usr and /usr/bin and /bin and /lib and all those are for.
[12:36] <minimec> petrik: Are you thinking about some kind of server-client structure or do you just want to seperate different kinds of data to seperate partitions?
[12:36] <HymnToLife> lmiranda> then the "poor modem drivrs" option is wrong
[12:36] <ihaveavirus> yes blaze
[12:36] <george_> i was just wondering if anyone could help me with installing debian and rpm packages?
[12:36] <Rubin> miranda82, not sure, no
[12:36] <ihaveavirus> ill find the package name and tell you blaze
[12:36] <petrik> Rubin, Well I guess it is the M$ mentality. I want to get my data on different drives
[12:36] <ihaveavirus> give me a second
[12:36] <lmiranda> where i can see that option?
[12:36] <stian> nickrud: a big problem there ;) but i try to download updates and so on :p
[12:36] <miranda82> Rubin, the answer is gnome-screensaver :)
[12:36] <blaze> ihaveavirus, i've already started downloading 2 :)
[12:37] <nickrud> stian, no way to burn a cd?
[12:37] <Rubin> george_, debian packages often just work, but you should get the ubuntu ported versions if available. rpm, google 'alien'
[12:37] <blaze> ihaveavirus, they are 30 mb each :D
[12:37] <blaze> i hope it works..
[12:37] <stian> nickrud: just on this ubuntu computer :)
[12:37] <nickrud> petrik, a great place to look is /usr/share/doc/<package-name>
[12:37] <iwkse> hi all...i-m having problems with compiling kernel...
[12:37] <nickrud> stian, so download the cd on the windows machine :)
[12:37] <iwkse> i get this error on make menuconfig
[12:37] <iwkse> In file included from scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/checklist.c:24:
[12:37] <iwkse> scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/dialog.h:31:20: error: curses.h: No such file or direct
[12:37] <iwkse> ory
[12:37] <Jazznite> any one what is CLI????
[12:38] <iwkse> it means it misses ncurses?
[12:38] <ihaveavirus> blaze, are you using dapper
[12:38] <stian> nickrud: I have no cd burner on windows computer, because my power-supply not support more than 7 HDDs :)
[12:38] <ihaveavirus> you don't want kernel source
[12:38] <ihaveavirus> you want linux-source
[12:38] <phibxr> Jazznite, command line interface? try gnome-terminal.
[12:38] <Rubin> petrik, i like to make a directory called /data on another drive, and then i make dirs there for anything i want to keep, and symlink that to the real filesystem where things i want to not loose go (for example /home and /var/lib/mysql)
[12:39] <iwkse> ihaveavirus: linux = kernel
[12:39] <petrik> Currently I have a 20GB drive which ubuntu formated with 240MB for itself and left the rest blank and unformatted
[12:39] <Rubin> petrik, but its one of those things every system admin has their own ways and only experiance gets you there
[12:39] <nickrud> iwkse, sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev
[12:39] <lmiranda> internet is very slow in ubuntu... can anyone help me ???
[12:39] <Rubin> petrik, but until your an expert at the commandline and copying files and things, you should avoid moving important system files around
[12:39] <blaze> ihaveavirus, breezy badger
[12:40] <nickrud> stian, rflmao
[12:40] <tuxedup> are you adsl or dial up lmiranda
[12:40] <lmiranda> adsl
[12:40] <stian> nickrud: don`t laugh at me :p
[12:40] <iwkse> thanks nickrud
[12:40] <Haydre> anyone know where I can get the shared library fglrk_pp.so.1? I have been trying to set up my ATI Radeon with the latest drivers
[12:40] <tuxedup> are you using a modem or a router?
[12:40] <Haydre> Sorry, make that fglrx_pp.so.1
[12:40] <tberg> anyone know how to switch back to windows
[12:40] <nickrud> stian, heh. then what I said before, carefully edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
[12:40] <tberg> all of my fav games dont work on linux
[12:40] <lmiranda> arescom 1000
[12:40] <flavioribeiro> can i put a 'key' in a folder?
[12:41] <stian> nickrud: I havent edited sources.list cant find anything wrong there
[12:41] <blaze> oh ihaveavirus, i'm trying now with linux-source
[12:41] <blaze> it's kind of big too :D
[12:41] <nickrud> stian, if you can't see kubuntu-desktop, you don't have the main ubuntu sources set up right. Truth.
[12:42] <Manika> my mobile phone is not accepting the PIN code I entered in the bluetooth config file... how should I proceed?
[12:42] <lmiranda> when i do a test of velocity... is very slow.. under 128... and mi connection is 512
[12:42] <stian> nickrud: should i remove all text from sources.list and paste all from ubuntu-pastebin?
[12:42] <tuxedup> lmiranda has it only been happening recently or has it been for a while?
[12:42] <nickrud> stian, yes
[12:42] <stian> nickrud ;D
[12:43] <nickrud> Haydre, I think that's in xorg-driver-fglrx
[12:43] <toby> gmail hates my firefox anyone know a cure?
[12:43] <tuxedup> have you checked wether its a problem with your isp lmiranda
[12:43] <nickrud> toby, using a real mail reading program?
[12:43] <toby> lol
[12:43] <lmiranda> in windows is good
[12:43] <petrik> Rubin, Will go and study up on access paths now to figure out how to format this drive in diskmanager
[12:44] <toby> but gmail has it's uses when bugmenot isn't happy etc
[12:44] <DJ_Danni> Hey i need help to Install a Program in .rpm
[12:44] <Rubin> petrik, as far as formatting, use fdisk to make the partition, and mkfs to make a filesystem on it
[12:44] <Haydre> nickrud: I'll check that, but I believe I already selected that. might I need the devel files for it?
[12:44] <nickrud> toby, gmail works in my firefox, but I'm on dapper rght this sec
[12:44] <lmiranda> internet is very slow in ubuntu... can anyone help me ???
[12:44] <DJ_Danni> Can you help me?
[12:44] <lmiranda> ahhhh
[12:44] <toby> i'm on 5.10
[12:44] <Rubin> petrik, man the following: fdisk, mkfs, cp, mv, ln, fstab, mount
[12:44] <toby> ff 1.0.8
[12:45] <Kyral> lmiranda: I think its a connection problem :P
[12:45] <lmiranda> why????
[12:45] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: you can try using alien for that. :)
[12:45] <toby> i think maybe wait a week for dapper :)
[12:45] <Kyral> lmiranda: Your internet connection I mean
[12:45] <DJ_Danni> Where can i get it?
[12:45] <george_> is there anyone who could take a few minutes to chat with me to help me with a problem?
[12:45] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: apt-get install alien
[12:45] <Kyral> lmiranda: the OS is rarely to blame for a slow NetConn
[12:45] <DJ_Danni> How?
[12:45] <lmiranda> but why in win works well?
[12:45] <nickrud> Haydre, try:  dpkg -l xorg-driver-fglrx and if the first to letters are ii (wanna be installed and is installed) then type dpkg -L org-driver-fglrx that file should be listed
[12:45] <Kyral> lmiranda: I dunno
[12:46] <lmiranda> i dont configure nothing in ubuntu
[12:46] <ihaveavirus> my net is faster in linux
[12:46] <DJ_Danni> What do you mean with atp-get??
[12:46] <blaze> ihaveavirus, it's not working again :(
[12:46] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: open a terminal and enter 'sudo apt-get install alien' or open synaptic and search for alien.
[12:46] <blaze> ihaveavirus, even with the linux-source packages
[12:46] <nickrud> ihaveavirus, of course it is ;)
[12:46] <lmiranda> ubuntu recognize auto the connection
[12:46] <tberg> well i'm going to go try to install windows again
[12:46] <ihaveavirus> try installing kernel source then
[12:46] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, hey it worked...
[12:46] <tberg> btw this os destroyed my other comp
[12:47] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: that's as far as i can help you though. i'm not really familiar with it since i've had no need to install rpms.
[12:47] <blaze> ok
[12:47] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, good to hear
[12:47] <gnomefreak> kernel-headers is all you should need
[12:47] <tberg> wouldn't work, os is gone, cant install.
[12:47] <ShadowShuriken> i think its prolly the...eth0 network card that doesnt work for...linux..
[12:47] <ShadowShuriken> its the sis900
[12:47] <ihaveavirus> theres no harm in installin packages you don't use unless ther're providing access to your computer
[12:47] <ihaveavirus> thats how I figure things out
[12:47] <nickrud> never install the kernel source, it's not worth your time
[12:47] <ShadowShuriken> i plugged it into the other one and it worked :)
[12:47] <ihaveavirus> i read the error and install a bunch of stuff
[12:48] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, i think its prolly the...eth0 network card that doesnt work for...linux..
[12:48] <lmiranda> internet is very slow in ubuntu... dhcp, can anyone help me please???
[12:48] <franke> what is the simplest way to _not_ start X at startup ?
[12:48] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, its the sis900
[12:48] <lmiranda> ah
[12:48] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, i plugged it into the other one and it worked :)
[12:48] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: you can always read the documentation. 'man alien' or read the stuff in /usr/share/doc/, whichever is more complete.
[12:48] <lmiranda> this is a good point
[12:48] <gnomefreak> franke: server install ;)
[12:48] <gnomefreak> lol
[12:48] <Haydre> nickrud: ok, I do have xorg-driver-fglrx installed, but libfglrx_pp.so.1 is not in it
[12:48] <nickrud> frank_, sudo mv /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm /etc/rc2.d/K13gdm
[12:48] <franke> what does the "K" do ?
[12:48] <gnomefreak> lmiranda: are you using ipv6?
[12:48] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, also you have to be plugging in the same one that your trying to activate
[12:49] <nickrud> Haydre, do you have usr/lib/libfglrx_pp.so.1.0 ?
[12:49] <gnomefreak> franke: what K? on the kde desltop?
[12:49] <nickrud> frank_, S means start (13th) K means kill (13th)
[12:49] <gnomefreak> desktop even
[12:49] <george_> how do i access dpkg?
[12:49] <james050286> how do i connect to a server using amule?
[12:49] <franke> nickrud, thanks
[12:49] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, ye..the one i was trying to work...was activated...but for some weird reason it didnt work...:S
[12:49] <cubikdice> james050286, this isnt the amule support channel
[12:49] <gnomefreak> george_: for what?
[12:49] <cubikdice> james050286, try googling it
[12:49] <george_> to install nerolinux
[12:50] <Manika> my mobile phone is not accepting the PIN code I entered in the bluetooth config file... how should I proceed?
[12:50] <gnomefreak> dpkg is a command line tool
[12:50] <james050286> ty
[12:50] <lmiranda> how i can see if im using ipv6?????
[12:50] <nickrud> frank_, you should install sysv-rc-conf
[12:50] <Kyral> EWW!!!
[12:50] <Kyral> Nerolinux == EVIL BAD!
[12:50] <george_> im new to linux
[12:50] <nickrud> frank_, gives you nice control
[12:50] <Kyral> use K3b MAN!
[12:50] <petrik> Thanks people. Will be back later (if I don't kill the PC) got to go out now
[12:50] <gnomefreak> george_: sudo dpkg -i file.deb
[12:50] <Kyral> or Gnomebaker
[12:50] <Kyral> or Graveman!
[12:50] <cubikdice> lmiranda, google "What's My IP?"
[12:50] <gnomefreak> Kyral: i installed in on dapper upstairs havent played with it yet
[12:50] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, would be interesting to figure out why. Iv never seen an ethernet device which linux loaded a driver for not work. those are all usually well tested and old code
[12:50] <george_> thanks gnomefreak
[12:50] <gnomefreak> lmiranda: ifconfig
[12:50] <Jazznite> phibxr,sorry 64 is to much for new Tec.,but wher i get gnometerminal??
[12:51] <gnomefreak> it will show you your ip addresses
[12:51] <Kyral> gnomefreak: what?
[12:51] <phibxr> Jazznite, 64? tec? did i miss something here? ;)
[12:51] <gnomefreak> Kyral: nero ;)
[12:51] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, ye...i'm surprised also ...o well atleast i got the net working :)
[12:51] <Jazznite> is my age
[12:51] <Kyral> gnomefreak: *blink blink*
[12:51] <ShadowShuriken> Rubin, thx a lot for ur help man :)
[12:51] <Haydre> nickrud: no, libfglrx_pp.so.1 is not in /usr/lib
[12:51] <Rubin> ShadowShuriken, np
[12:51] <phibxr> Jazznite, anyway. you already have gnome-terminal if you're running ubuntu. ;)
[12:51] <ShadowShuriken> gnomefreak, thx for all the help...i got the net working :)
[12:51] <nickrud> Haydre, usr/lib/libfglrx_pp.so.1.0 <-- note the .0
[12:51] <jojoman02> cool feature some people don't know, if you hit tab when typing a filename it autocompletes in terminal...
[12:52] <gnomefreak> Jazznite: applications>accessories>terminal
[12:52] <nickrud> Haydre, yes or no?
[12:52] <gnomefreak> ShadowShuriken: good yw
[12:52] <Haydre> nickrud: no, not that either
[12:52] <Haydre> nickrud: nothing libfglrx*
[12:52] <Terminus> jojoman02: with dapper, it's even better. it autocompletes command options too! :)
[12:53] <Jazznite> and  now what i do??
[12:53] <nickrud> Haydre, I have the .0 version on dapper, maybe it's time to upgrade. Depends on why you're getting the error. Any clues to offer?
[12:53] <lmiranda> inet6 addr?
=== root_ is now known as MENDIGO
[12:54] <ihaveavirus> im having problems to blaze
[12:54] <ihaveavirus> i installed the source
[12:54] <nicolas_> does anyone has noticed a firefox segfault after two stumbles in dapper ?
[12:54] <Haydre> nickrud: I was trying to install the latest ATI proprietary drivers (8.25.18), and they seemed to install fine, but then, when I tried to run aticonfig --initial, it gave me the, "could not find shared libraries" error
[12:54] <ihaveavirus> and my ./configure still doesn see it
[12:54] <nicolas_> i can reproduce it anytime
[12:55] <lmiranda> internet slow... please help me :p
[12:55] <nickrud> Haydre, are you using the ati howto on the wiki? Since I don't have ati I can't help you make it work. Identifying files & packages is easier ;)
[12:55] <stian> :P
[12:55] <nickrud> stian, ok?
[12:55] <lmiranda> internet slow... please help me :p
[12:56] <stian> nickrud: I write :D
[12:56] <DJ_Danni> Hey i am in Temial and what next to install
[12:56] <Haydre> nickrud: I will take a look at that, but I believe that is for the older version of the drivers, which I had already
[12:56] <stian> nickrud: I write fast as possible into sources.list almost finish :)
[12:56] <nickrud> nicolas_, yes, it's crashed a couple of times today, seems flash related for me
[12:57] <DJ_Danni> ?
[12:57] <ihaveavirus> blaze you have to extract the source its in /usr/src
[12:57] <ihaveavirus> then
[12:57] <nickrud> DJ_Danni, what are you trying to do?
[12:57] <blaze> ihaveavirus, but i download it with Synaptic
[12:57] <DJ_Danni> Install .rpm and xine media Player
[12:57] <nickrud> stian, take your time, and do a super careful spell check
[12:57] <toby> !vpn
[12:57] <ubotu> I heard vpn is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Gaming_VPN_Using_PPTPD
[12:57] <DJ_Danni> I am a bigenner in Linux:D
[12:58] <ihaveavirus> do ./configure  --with-kernel=dir
[12:58] <ihaveavirus> so you extracted it to a directory
[12:58] <ihaveavirus> then ran that command
[12:58] <DJ_Danni> ME?
[12:58] <nickrud> DJ_Danni, sudo apt-get install xine-ui to get xine. If you're a beginner in Linux, here's a hard and fast rule: never ever use .rpm in ubuntu
[12:58] <Kyral> never use RPMs on a Debian based system period
[12:58] <mabus06> I can use telnet/ftp from my school's computers, running windows... and on my home ubuntu computer I am running sshd on port 21, 22, 23, and 32337... anyone have any idea why I can't connect to either port?
[12:59] <DJ_Danni> wuy noat??
[12:59] <DW|Sakara|U> mabus06 are you behind a router at home?
[12:59] <paradizelost> DJ_Danni: because ubuntu is a .deb based distro
[12:59] <Kyral> Becauses its a PITA to do :P
[12:59] <DJ_Danni> ok
[12:59] <paradizelost> DJ_Danni: rpms are for redhat
[12:59] <nickrud> and it will cause total grief
[12:59] <paradizelost> it can be done, but its a pain
[12:59] <Kyral> I'd rather compile than try to convert an RPM to Deb (and vice versa)
[12:59] <DJ_Danni> But this  sudo apt-get is it som software or what?
[12:59] <DJ_Danni> ok
[12:59] <Kyral> but then again I like compiling...so
[12:59] <jojoman02> !tapioca
[12:59] <ubotu> NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, jojoman02
[01:00] <DJ_Danni> ?
[01:00] <paradizelost> DJ_Danni: you might be better off with synaptic or adept
[01:00] <mabus06> DW|Sakara|U: that part is all fine.
[01:00] <paradizelost> apt-get is the command line version
[01:00] <nicolas_> nickrud: at my first look, it stupidely appears that running firefox with the command `mozilla` fixes the problem :P
[01:00] <DJ_Danni> where can i get it?
[01:00] <mabus06> DW|Sakara|U:  I can connect to it from other places, just not at school.
[01:00] <paradizelost> DJ_Danni: they're already there
[01:00] <Terminus> paradizelost: i told him to either use apt-get or synaptic, he went with apt-get. lol
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[01:00] <nicolas_> nickrud: probably luck
[01:00] <paradizelost> click on system->administration->synaptic package manager
=== The^nike is now known as The^nike|away|
[01:01] <ihaveavirus> lmao blaze man its not working for me either
[01:01] <ihaveavirus> damn
[01:01] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: here's a tip, always mention the name of the person you're talking to so that they'll know it's for them. especially useful if irc clients to highlighting. :)
[01:01] <DJ_Danni> ok i am there and what next?
[01:01] <DJ_Danni> ok
[01:01] <stian> nickrud: done, what now?
[01:02] <paradizelost> DJ_Danni: hit search, and type in the name of the package you want to install
[01:02] <paradizelost> it will find it
[01:02] <DW|Sakara|U> mabus06, Then I think your school has a firewall blocking out going connections on those ports
[01:02] <Where> Is there any way to reverse the default page printing order?
[01:02] <paradizelost> so you would search for xine
[01:02] <W_Irving> so no one wants to help me compile wpa supplicant?
[01:02] <nickrud> stian, type apt-get update && apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[01:02] <paradizelost> Where: usually when you print, you can choose to print in reverse order
[01:02] <paradizelost> usually as print last page first
[01:03] <Where> paradizelost: in the OO.org print dialog, there isn't such an option :(
[01:03] <nickrud> stian, I gotta go for about a half hour, look at paradizelost & Kyral if you have issues (I hope you guys don't mind)
[01:03] <mabus06> DW|Sakara|U: I am running sshd on 21, 22, 23, and 32337... 21 and 23 are definately open because I've used ftp from school before.
[01:03] <Kyral> hum wha
[01:03] <mabus06> DW|Sakara|U:  And I ran a web based port scan locally and it confirmed this.
[01:03] <nickrud> Kyral, updating sources from a console, going to kde
[01:03] <paradizelost> nickrud: np
[01:03] <stian> nickrud: i msg you tomorrow i need some sleep now
[01:03] <Kyral> sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[01:03] <Kyral> NEXT
[01:03] <Kyral> :P
[01:04] <nickrud> Kyral, heh. Except his sources didn't see kubuntu-desktop :)
[01:04] <ompaul> DJ_Danni, Ubuntu can do it for you, however you need what is called "universe" enabled to do this you should follow the steps laid out here: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto : the you can install it "and it is called totem-xine" in from the menu :system administration synaptic-package-manager
[01:04] <nickrud> bbl
[01:04] <tubbie> why doesn't Ubuntu come with all ports closed by default?
[01:04] <Kyral> what kinda fubared sourcces are those?
[01:04] <Kyral> tubbie: it does
[01:04] <george_> once u install alien how do u access the program?
[01:05] <DW|Sakara|U> mabus06, Ok so you are attemptnig to SSH your home pc from school? using putty i assume, and you have having timeouts?
[01:05] <DJ_Danni> paradizelost i am finnish looking in pack manenger for xine and i don't see it:S:S
[01:05] <Haydre> is there any way of reinstalling ubuntu, while keeping all of your existing files, pref. without burning them all to a DVD or similar removable media
[01:05] <Kyral> xine-ui
[01:06] <DW|Sakara|U> mabus06, can you ping your home pc from school, trying port scan your machine at home with nmap or something similar
[01:06] <Terminus> Haydre: if your /home is in a different partition, yes.
[01:06] <stian> Kyral: I have f*cked up all now =/ because nickrud told me to remove all old stuff on sources.list and change it with http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047
[01:06] <PyChild> Hi, i have a little customization question
[01:06] <Where> PyChild: ask away :)
[01:07] <PyChild> about the gnome desktop and volume icons
[01:07] <PyChild> how can i show removable partitions and usb
[01:07] <stian> Kyral: and now i get ERROR on everything when i try "apt-get update"
[01:07] <MENDIGO> light up your spliff, light up your chalice, we gonna burn it inna buk-in-hamm palace!!
[01:07] <PyChild> *without* showing the static partitions
[01:07] <Haydre> Terminus: Would it be possible to create a new partition, move home over, reinstall, then move it back and delete the partition?
[01:07] <DW|Sakara|U> stian do you sudo apt-get update?
[01:08] <stian> DW|Sakara|U: YES!
[01:08] <Kyral> stian: run it as root :P
[01:08] <stian> ;p
[01:08] <DW|Sakara|U> hmm not fun
[01:08] <stian> I do
[01:08] <DW|Sakara|U> umm
[01:08] <DW|Sakara|U> any desciption of the error?
[01:08] <Terminus> Haydre: if you've got free space or a spare hard disk, why not? :)
[01:09] <ompaul> stian, sudo apt-get update<<< that should sort the first level of errors - that set of sources is good
[01:09] <stian> DW|Sakara|U: It`s in norwegian, then i need to convert all :p
[01:09] <blaze> "configure: error:
[01:09] <blaze> *** Cannot determine the version of the linux kernel source.", help =) ?
[01:10] <paradizelost> well all, i gotta go fix a hot chicks computeer, basic format/reload windows xp.
[01:10] <stian> ompaul: i have changed source.list !!!! apt-get update is /etc/apt/source.list
[01:10] <paradizelost> i hope she brought her kneepads...

[01:10] <Terminus> Haydre: all prefs are stored in hidden dirs in your home dir so you have to copy those. they start with a dot.
[01:10] <victor256> hi
[01:10] <Zezin> Hi everyone! Do you know if the Ubuntu 6.06 RC is going to have any changes until June first?
[01:11] <Zezin> (day of the official release)
[01:11] <victor256> i have a problem with sound in games but i can't change the sound system
[01:11] <paradizelost> Zezin: if they do, you can just apt-get dist-upgrade and you'll have them
[01:11] <gnomefreak> Zezin: not much other than bug fixes
[01:11] <Zezin> Oh ok... I'll take this know then... thanks a lot
[01:11] <victor256> if i try to change to alsa the test will fail
[01:12] <paradizelost> victor256: you wouldn't happen to have an nforce2 sound card would you?
[01:12] <victor256> worst i think is the sound blaster live 7.1
[01:12] <victor256> the fake audigy ls :P
[01:13] <blaze> can anyone help me with ./configure ?
[01:13] <blaze> please
[01:14] <victor256> ubuntu detects it as audigy ls and it works but not in every app
[01:14] <victor256> and i don't know how to change from esd to alsa or oss
[01:14] <gnomefreak> blaze: not if you dont tell us whats wrong with it
[01:14] <blaze> (configure: error:
[01:14] <blaze> *** Please specify the location of the kernel source with
[01:14] <blaze> ) please help
[01:14] <blaze> i've already asked a few times :(
[01:15] <blaze> i'm patient.. :-P
[01:15] <gnomefreak> that really doesnt say much
[01:15] <paradizelost> blaze: did you download your kernel source, extract it, and create a symlink from /usr/src/linux-`uname -r` to /usr/src/linux ?
[01:15] <blaze> no, because i can't find the kernel-source-2.6.12 file
[01:15] <blaze> i only have *2.6.11
[01:16] <blaze> and my kernel is 2.6.12
[01:16] <paradizelost> when you download it, it goes to /usr/src/linux
[01:16] <victor256> anyone? about my sound question?
[01:16] <paradizelost> rosex:  is that supposed to be ro-sex or rose-x?
[01:16] <blaze> i've seen that, paradizelost
[01:17] <rosex> rose(n)x
[01:17] <forn_> what the best way for a newb to see all the stuff on his kernel?
[01:17] <paradizelost> so blaze, if you cd to /usr/src/ and do a tar -xvzf linux-whaterveryourkernelis.tar.gz and ln -s /usr/src/linux-whatever /usr/src/linux
[01:17] <HymnToLife> forn_> you mean modules ?
[01:17] <blaze> ok.. so gnomefreak, i want to install fuse-1.4.tar.gz and in the readme it is said to extract it and ./configure, make and make install it
[01:18] <forn_> yeah
=== marcin_ is now known as marcin_ant
[01:18] <baconbacon> lsmod
[01:18] <blaze> ok, paradizelost, i'll try
[01:18] <forn_> and whatever driver come with it and everything
[01:18] <baconbacon> forn_: lsmod to see "running" modules
[01:18] <victor256> why if i choose alsa as output it fails when tested!
[01:19] <forn_> ty
[01:19] <PyChild> hello?
[01:19] <baconbacon> and lspci to see which hardware is "seen"
[01:19] <rob138> how do i mount my ipod as write-able?
[01:19] <HymnToLife> !tell PyChild about hello

[01:19] <PyChild> Sorry, i fell of the interents
[01:19] <osotogari> hey all, can anyone suggest a program to tag my mp3 collection? Thanks :)
[01:19] <blaze> what is the equivalent of "cd.." in linux?
[01:19] <HymnToLife> rob138> what FS is it formatted in ?
[01:19] <s3v> lol
[01:20] <DJ_Danni> hey what is that amateur radio?
[01:20] <HymnToLife> if it"s NTFS you cant
[01:20] <victor256> gee just giveme a hint or a link i can look for this info at least
[01:20] <blaze> i mean.. going one folder up
[01:20] <rob138> HymnToLife it's VFat
[01:20] <HymnToLife> blaze> same thing
[01:20] <PyChild> blaze: it's "cd .." with a space
[01:20] <dou213> blaze, "cd .."
[01:20] <blaze> oh :) 10x PyChild
[01:20] <blaze> :)
[01:20] <PyChild> blaze: yep

[01:20] <djtansey> i am running dapper on my laptop and want to test the latest install CD so I can get any bugs I detect reported. Are there any more beta ISOs coming out soon, or is the rc image going to be the last?
[01:20] <HymnToLife> !tel rob138 abou ntfs
[01:20] <ubotu> NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, HymnToLife
[01:20] <HymnToLife> !tell rob138 abou ntfs
[01:21] <dou213> and cd\ to go to root folder i think, or not?
[01:21] <HymnToLife> !caps ubotu :p
[01:21] <ubotu> HymnToLife: Huh? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[01:21] <victor256> can anyone help me?
[01:21] <rob138> HymnToLife, he told me nothing
[01:21] <osotogari> cd / to root no?
[01:21] <PyChild> Sorry, my question was, how can i hide the hard disk partition from the desktop without also hiding removvable media like cdrom and usb?
[01:21] <HymnToLife> !ntfs
[01:21] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[01:21] <DJ_Danni> Hey what is this amateur radio?
[01:21] <HymnToLife> here's the stuff you need rob138
[01:21] <osotogari> hey all, can anyone suggest a program to tag my mp3 collection? Thanks :)
[01:22] <DJ_Danni> ?
[01:22] <rob138> HymnToLife, but the ipod isn't ntfs
[01:22] <HymnToLife> rob138> instructions to mount FAT are in there too

[01:23] <victor256> well nobody is answering my call
[01:23] <osotogari> thanks s3v, whats it like to use?
[01:23] <george_> does anybody know how to use Alien?
[01:23] <DJ_Danni> What do you mean??
[01:23] <victor256> why if i choose alsa as output it fails when tested?
[01:23] <Sakara> victor256: depending on what it we can attempt to help you
[01:23] <HymnToLife> victor256> what's your problem ?
[01:23] <s3v> osotogari> easy :)
[01:23] <PyChild> no one?
[01:24] <victor256> i have no sound in about 50% of the apps
[01:24] <osotogari> sweet! thanks :)
[01:24] <Sakara> victor256: none of us are paid to help anyone or anything
[01:24] <HymnToLife> DJ_Danni> talking about amateur radios has nothing whatsoever to do with Ubuntu suport
[01:24] <paradizelost> blaze: i've never done a manual kernel config on ubuntu, and there may be an easier way, maybe gnomefreak knows
[01:24] <paradizelost> i g2g though
[01:24] <DJ_Danni> ok
[01:24] <paradizelost> cya l8r
[01:24] <blaze> see ya paradizelost
[01:24] <HymnToLife> victor256> in what apps for ex ?
[01:24] <victor256> letme give you an example like gltron
[01:24] <victor256> was working ok in kubuntu but not ubuntu
[01:24] <blaze> gnomefreak, are you there to help me :D ?
[01:25] <PyChild> waiting in line 
[01:25] <HymnToLife> I dont know what this is, sorry
[01:25] <Sakara> victor256: is there a settings panel where you have to specify which sound card to use?
[01:25] <ompaul> !compile
[01:25] <ubotu> A nice howto about compiling software from source code can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompilingSoftware (but remember to search !apt first, after adding all the !repos)
[01:25] <egad> btw.. us.archive.... is working again.. so you can remove it from the topic..
[01:25] <ompaul> blaze, ^^ up a line again
[01:25] <victor256> there's a media selector but i try to change to alsa and it fails the test
[01:25] <Sakara> Ventrilo I know has the option to play sound from multiple sound cards sometimes it sets itself to things like pcspeaker for daft reasons
[01:26] <george_> is there anybody who can help me with alien or any other program that can convert rpm packages to debian
[01:26] <ompaul> egad, you sure it will be there in an hour?
[01:26] <blaze> ok ompaul, i'll read this
[01:26] <victor256> i dont really know what sound system kubuntu uses
[01:26] <HymnToLife> george_> are you _sure_ there's no other way to get your stuff ?
[01:26] <Sakara> victor256: do you have an onboard sound card or soem fancy thing
[01:27] <forn_> how do i know if i have ieee80211 subsystem installed?
[01:27] <egad> ompaul, are you sure anything will be anywhere in an hour? :cP
[01:27] <george_> yeah im trying to get avg for linux and they all come in rpm
=== HellDragon is now known as HellDragon|
[01:27] <victor256> no onboard card it's a sound blaster live 7.1, audigy ls like
[01:27] <rob138> HymnToLife, that didn't work, cuz when i plug in my ipod, it makes a different folder than the one already specified, ie i set /dev/sdb1 to /media/ipod and then when it connects it goes to /media/ipod-1
[01:28] <ompaul> egad, well given its performace I would assume that I would still be alive before that server goes offline again, unless they changed boxes or some such
[01:28] <Sakara> victor256: hmm i have only ever used the generic ole AC97 thats on hjust about every mobo for the past 3 years
[01:28] <PyChild> guys, how can i hide hard disk partitions from the desktop without also hiding removable media like cdrom and usb?
[01:28] <jojoman02> what is a good http downloading program for ubuntu
[01:28] <jojoman02> like download file from the internet....
[01:28] <Sakara> victor256: unfortunatly i am of no help to you
[01:28] <jojoman02> (besides wget)
[01:28] <victor256> that's ok
[01:28] <HymnToLife> jojoman02> there's aria but what's wrong with wget ?
[01:29] <nicolas_> nickrud: seems i really fixed it by installing the flash lib directly from the website instead of using apt
[01:29] <jojoman02> HymnToLife, does it download from multiple locations same time?
[01:29] <jojoman02> HymnToLife, also does it have resume feature?
[01:29] <erik_m> hi all having a few problem , what is Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: and how do i get this to work ?
[01:29] <HymnToLife> very goo question, I don't have a clue :p
[01:29] <anacaona> hello all
[01:29] <HymnToLife> jojoman02> yes, but wget has it too
[01:29] <egad> ompaul, I see.. I dont think it matters much really.. archive.ubuntu has been iffy too..
[01:29] <anacaona> sound disappeared in my ubuntu and i don't quite get why
[01:30] <rob138> does anyone know how to have an ipod be write-able when connected?
[01:30] <PyChild> ok g2g
[01:30] <anacaona> this is what was happening when it disappeared
[01:30] <deoryp> anacaona> do you get any error messages when trying to play something with xmms or the lile?
[01:30] <ompaul> egad, even ie. had an outage but that was a huge isp fall over masses and masses of air conditioning fell over other than that it is generally stable
[01:30] <anacaona> i had launched mplayer with an .avi and firefox launched at the same time
[01:31] <deoryp> anacaona> just close them both and then reopen one, it should work
[01:31] <anacaona> firefox's master password screen popped up and i was typing in the first characters when mplayer screen showed up and i "typed them into" that screen instead
[01:31] <anacaona> and there ya go, no sound.
[01:31] <alexicon> is there a sepearate channel for the live cd??
[01:31] <hollywoodb> how do I get apt-get, aptitude, & synaptic to stop warning me about a broken package?
[01:31] <anacaona> deoryp: i don't get any error messages
[01:32] <anacaona> i've tried from the command line with mpg321: no error messages
[01:32] <deoryp> anacaona: lame fix... reboot?
[01:32] <anacaona> lame? why lame?
[01:32] <deoryp> anacaona: no one likes rebooting
[01:32] <anacaona> aah
[01:32] <anacaona> ok.
[01:32] <nickrud> nicolas_, yes, that works. I haven't used it recently but will try that, I don't always get sync between video & sound in flash
[01:32] <anacaona> i thought you meant lame the decoder.
[01:32] <biovore> anyone know if they have gstreamer-0.10 working well in dapper?
[01:32] <deoryp> lol
[01:32] <anacaona> actually, i've rebooted a few times since but still no go.
[01:33] <hollywoodb> biovore: seems fine
[01:33] <biovore> ok.. tnx
[01:33] <Sakara> So 1st June 2006 new release any one know whether it confirmed, delayed?

[01:33] <Sakara> crimsun: thanks woo
[01:34] <Sakara> so testing is on scheduel? love it think they might be able to get it out earlier?
[01:34] <deoryp> anacaona: sorry, i am not sure then... maybe you missed a setting in mplayer
[01:34] <s3v> anyone has experience in installing wifi on the Toshiba Tecra 8200?

[01:35] <hollywoodb> anacaona: when run from a term do you get errors about unable to open pcm, or /dev/dsp busy?
[01:36] <anacaona> wouldn't ya know it...
[01:36] <ompaul> Sakara, its a timed release so they are aiming at that date with a vengeance
[01:36] <spundun> hi all...
[01:36] <anacaona> i try to play an mp3 with mpg321 and i get this:

[01:37] <ompaul> Sakara, get a live cd from cdimage.ubuntu.com and see how it is going fresh ones every day - but as its only running in RAM it is a lot slower than as installed one
[01:37] <anacaona> sorry about that.
[01:37] <ompaul> anacaona, I'll second that
[01:37] <s3v> egad> maybe i can use the same drivers through ndiswrapper?
[01:38] <Rubin> Is there a way to make beep-media-player or anything else have 'always show on active desktop' checked, automaticaly?

[01:38] <s3v> egad> i know, i read the wiki/forum post about the broadcom one - but dapper is going to support it :)
[01:39] <egad> s3v, a possibility but im too inexperienced on it to help you

[01:42] <eggzeck> first tell us what babylon is =)
[01:43] <bur[n] er> babylon is a new term for me
[01:43] <ivol> babylon is a fantastic dictionary

[01:44] <anacaona> hollywoodb: trying to find some info on that error message - any pointers?
[01:44] <jason_> I have tried alsa-oss
[01:44] <jason_> no luck
[01:44] <ompaul> eggzeck, its a translation software
[01:44] <eggzeck> ompaul, oh, but he said Dictionary in the first place :)
[01:44] <jason_> i have ran aoss firefox in terminal and firefox/flash will freeze
[01:44] <jason_> can anyone help me?
[01:44] <hollywoodb> anacaona: try an audio player of your choice, but run it from the command line, see if there are any errors when you try to play a file
[01:45] <jason_> seems as gaim causes problems with flash as well.  (gaim sounds)
[01:45] <ompaul> eggzeck, yeap and I was looking at it in google :-0
[01:45] <eggzeck> ompaul, haha, I guess maybe I should have done the same.
[01:45] <McScruff> is there a way to set vnc up to take a full workspace?
[01:46] <g0dchild> crap- terribly sorry bout earlier- i accidentally pasted someth with all the carriage spaces.
[01:46] <ompaul> eggzeck, no, you were well within the space I consider normal
[01:46] <eggzeck> ivol, yes I found one
[01:46] <eggzeck> ivol, package name: babytrans
[01:46] <anacaona> alsa_setup(): Failed to open pcm device (hw:0,0): Device or resource busy
[01:47] <anacaona> from xmms
[01:47] <eggzeck> ivol, sudo apt-get install babytrans
[01:47] <szoth> is this a reasonable place to report a problem with the torrent files for the release candidate?
[01:47] <eggzeck> ivol, assuming you have the correct repos
[01:47] <jason_> does anyone have any idea with my sound issues?
[01:47] <dou213> !tell dou213 pastebin
[01:47] <eggzeck> ompaul, well then that's a good thing to know.
[01:47] <forn_> i cant find ipw2200-source in my apt repositories and module-assistant says it needs it
[01:47] <g0dchild> ompaul, i am having a prob with alsa too...when i restart alsa, it tells me that it cant find any hardware devices- is it smth to do with the kernel?
[01:48] <forn_> can anyone please help?
[01:48] <ivol> ok I failed this installation
[01:48] <ompaul> g0dchild, I don't know, so the obvious question is this: did  u have it working and did you change the kernel
[01:48] <ivol> I have a conflict wit mplayer
[01:48] <dou213> can someone type in "!tell dou213 pastebin" pls
[01:48] <eggzeck> forn_, perhaps you want: ieee80211-source
[01:49] <ompaul> forn_, is that for wireless?
[01:49] <Sakara> Is there a command similar to nmap in windows? nmap is a port scanner?
[01:49] <Sakara> There is a gui one i see but what about at the command console?
[01:50] <ivol> I resolved it by edit a file but I really I don't understand  how do it
[01:50] <g0dchild> ompaul, well...it might have someth to do with...dare i say it? -dapper...so i'll check out the forums
[01:50] <ompaul> dou213, do this instead  >> /msg ubotu pastebin << andit will tell you what pastebin is
[01:50] <nickrud_> Sakara, yes nmap is a port scanner, try nmapfe
[01:50] <eggzeck> Sakara: Are you asking a windows question here?
[01:50] <ompaul> g0dchild, no check in help.ubuntu.com
[01:50] <Sakara> no i am asking for the ubuntu equivilent
[01:50] <forn_> eggzeck_, ty ill try
[01:50] <eggzeck> Sakara, oh excuse me, I understood wrong.
[01:50] <nickrud_> Sakara, but I like ethereal
[01:50] <eggzeck> forn_, you're welcome.
[01:51] <Sakara> eggzeck thats ok
[01:51] <Sakara> nickrud_ thata packet sniffere aint it
[01:51] <dou213> thx
[01:51] <forn_> ompaul yes it is
[01:51] <nickrud_> Sakara, just a hint, but you know already
[01:51] <ompaul> Sakara, well nmap started on linux so the answer is yes - System Administration Synaptic and run it
[01:51] <eggzeck> forn_, then you want the package I told you ;)
[01:51] <eggzeck> forn_, sudo apt-get install ieee80211-source
[01:51] <jason_> flash/firefox issue.  alsa-oss installed. still overlapping problem. aoss firefox tried but froze at some points.  any help would be appreciated
[01:51] <ompaul> forn_, as eggzeck said
[01:51] <Sakara> so sudo apt-get isntall nmapfe
[01:52] <ompaul> Sakara, well nmap is actually its name
[01:52] <Sakara> yer
[01:52] <Sakara> the package is called nmapfe is it?
[01:53] <forn_> well my repositories dont have it
[01:53] <ompaul> Sakara, ~I say again it is nmap ...
[01:53] <ompaul> !info ieee80211-source
[01:53] <nickrud_> Sakara, in dapper, I have it
[01:53] <ompaul> ubotu Package 'ieee80211-source' does not exist.
[01:53] <ubotu> Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ompaul
=== nalioth is now known as noirequus
[01:53] <Sakara> the cmd is nmap
[01:53] <ompaul> Sakara, so is the package
[01:53] <Sakara> nice
[01:53] <forn_> !info ieee80211-source
[01:53] <Sakara> ok got it
[01:53] <Sakara> working <3 it
[01:54] <ompaul> forn_, it does not exist
[01:54] <h6w> Hallo!  I've been trying to make gedit in ubuntu allow me to edit sftp files, in other words, not "Read Only".  I have followed the instructions in bug #30435 but it doesn't seem to be working.  It doesn't say whether it should be a list or a string.  I have tried both, but they don't work, any ideas?
[01:54] <eggzeck> ompaul, I have it.
[01:55] <forn_> how can i get more repositories so i ccan find ieee80211-source?
[01:55] <ompaul> eggzeck, it exists for dapper
[01:55] <eggzeck> ompaul, but perhaps that's because I'm on a Dapper system right now.
[01:55] <eggzeck> ahh yes, excuse me then forn_
[01:55] <jason_> flash/firefox issue.  alsa-oss installed. still overlapping problem. aoss firefox tried but froze at some points.  any help would be appreciated
[01:55] <ompaul> forn_, can you wait 5 days and upgrade to dapper?
[01:55] <jason_> dapper issue
[01:55] <forn_> can i upgrade to dapper today?
[01:55] <ompaul> !dapper
[01:55] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[01:56] <ompaul> forn_, yes look up a line or three :-)
[01:56] <Codenut> how do you clear a hard drive to accept a build of ubuntu?
[01:56] <eggzeck> ubotu tell forn_ about upgrade
[01:56] <ompaul> Codenut, you let the install cd do it for you
[01:56] <forn_> ty
[01:56] <nickrud_> hm, what's that list message id again
=== rapha_ is now known as rapha
[01:57] <Codenut> I tried that, but it comes up with errors. I think it has to do with my use of a celeron?
[01:57] <forn_> ty very much i think ill just upgrade to dapper beta for now maybe itll solve my problems
[01:57] <forn_> ompaul ty
[01:58] <forn_> eggzeck ty
[01:58] <philc> how can I update my bios from within linux? Aopen gave me a .bin and a .exe; is there a windows live cd or something I can use to get this bios updated?
[01:59] <Codenut> how big a hard drive do I need to run ubuntu?
=== ohoel is now known as ^ohoel
[01:59] <eggzeck> Codenut, not big at all
[01:59] <eggzeck> Codenut, one of my systems has ubuntu on a 6GB
[01:59] <HymnToLife> Codenut> 5 GB will be more than enough for a basinc install
[02:00] <hollywoodb> anacaona: if the device or resource is busy, chances are either esd or arts is using it. fire up system monitor & kill either or both of those and try again
[02:00] <HymnToLife> and I have it dual-booting with MS-DOS on 3,2
[02:00] <bimberi> Codenut: the normal CD install requires minimum 1.8GB
[02:00] <Codenut> OK, I am going to assume the thing is not happy with the Celeron or memory and move on to building a bigger system with an i386 ture processor onboard.
[02:01] <segfault> hi when i close the lib of my laptop with ubuntu on it, it keeps prompting for my password when i reopen it, anuone where to turn this off?
[02:01] <Codenut> ah, that is why I have gotten away with 3.6 gb
[02:01] <segfault> lib=lid
[02:01] <Codenut> brb
[02:01] <bimberi> Codenut: it shouldn't be a celeron issue.  It works fine on my Celeron466
[02:01] <HymnToLife> same here on my Celeron 2,8 laptop
[02:02] <bimberi> showoff :P
[02:02] <HymnToLife> no way
[02:02] <HymnToLife> at 2800 or t 466, Celerons still suck big time
[02:03] <eggzeck> (I don't want to be offtopic here) but they do not suck IMHO
[02:03] <Codenut> So I am wise to build a better system with more RAM, right?
[02:03] <HymnToLife> how much do you have atm ?
[02:04] <eggzeck> Codenut, how much RAM?
[02:04] <sam_> Is something wrong with the RC Desktop i386 bittorrent?
[02:04] <Codenut> I am going to build a 1 GHZ PIII with 512Meg of ram.
[02:04] <eggzeck> more than enough
[02:04] <HymnToLife> yep
[02:04] <Codenut> I was using some older ram that could have been bad. One stick was 128Meg.
[02:04] <HymnToLife> It runs preyy smoothly on my old box with  8 MB RAM
[02:05] <yggdrasil> whats the cmd to mount a fat32 sata drive .. sda2 lets say
[02:05] <blab|patrick> hi
[02:05] <eggzeck> 8MB ??
[02:05] <Codenut> text or graphical?
[02:05] <dli> yggdrasil, " sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/floppy "
[02:05] <blab|patrick> i need help with compiling my wifi driver for linux
[02:05] <yggdrasil> no fs ?
[02:05] <sam_> segfault: /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn and/or /etc/acpi/lid.sh
[02:05] <blab|patrick> its a ralink 2500 driver
[02:05] <benoy> is there a way to prevent firefox from showing the downloads window everytime another download is started?
[02:05] <blab|patrick> i tried follow instructions in its readme
[02:06] <dli> blab|patrick, does " modprobe rt2500 " work?
[02:06] <Codenut> brb, going to get my shower.
[02:06] <blab|patrick> am now in windows
[02:06] <HymnToLife> Fluxbox :)

[02:06] <eggzeck> oops, double yes
[02:06] <blab|patrick> i need the latest driver so that wpa2psk works
[02:06] <segfault> sam_, thx
[02:06] <dli> blab|patrick, okay, did you use linux-source and kernel-package ?
[02:07] <yongBCS> hi, what's the difference between 'Desktop CD', 'Alternate install CD' and 'Server install CD'?
[02:07] <blab|patrick> dli: what?
[02:07] <blab|patrick> cp Makefile.6 Makefile <-- 1st step
[02:07] <blab|patrick> $make
[02:07] <dli> blab|patrick, if you don't know any of them :( you have to read about kernel-package
[02:07] <sam_> segfault: You have to '/etc/init.d/acpid restart' before the changes kick in.
[02:08] <yggdrasil> dli do i need to have scsi emulation in kernel for thist ?
[02:08] <blab|patrick> 3) $insmod rt2570.ko     # Insert driver module
[02:08] <blab|patrick> well here i fail
[02:08] <blab|patrick> what the hell do i have to do with that?
[02:08] <Phoul> Is there a way to get k3b to burn .wma?
[02:08] <benoy> haha easy as that if i had looked
[02:08] <helpneeded> hi i have a simple question  its about a command extension i was told  to  put on  but i cant rem it exactly  can someone advice  ... is it  noacpi or nopcia
[02:08] <benoy> thank you
[02:08] <helpneeded> ? thanks
[02:08] <eggzeck> benoy, you're welcome.
[02:08] <dli> yggdrasil, you need modules: sd_mod , sg , [euo] hci_hcd , usb_stroage
[02:09] <Phoul> *coughs* anyone know?
[02:09] <blab|patrick> dli: i searched the help files bundled with linux but non of the term appeared in console lead to an satisfying answer :/
[02:09] <yggdrasil> usb storeage for sata ?
[02:09] <blab|patrick> and as i said, i dont have web in linux until i have a working wifi connection
[02:09] <sam_> helpneeded: noacpi
[02:09] <helpneeded> ty ... lol
[02:09] <dli> yggdrasil, sorry, I thought it's usb, since it's fat :(
[02:10] <helpneeded> coult not rem ...
[02:11] <blab|patrick> dli: well what did u try to tell me
[02:11] <blab|patrick> it would be nice if ur answer may a little more specific
[02:11] <sam_> Has anyone been able to bittorrent the ubuntu-6.06-rc-desktop-i386.iso ?
[02:11] <blab|patrick> its 2am here, i am tired of 5hours spending on that wifi crap
[02:11] <blab|patrick> and still nothing :/
[02:11] <Haydre> Just wondering, I'm currently running breezy, is it possible to use the dapper repositories in breezy? Or will this create dependency issues
[02:12] <sam_> I get "rejected by tracker - Requested download is not authorized for use with this tracker."
[02:12] <yggdrasil> blap|patrick im pretty good with that stuff
[02:12] <dli> Haydre, dist-upgrade should be smoothly, if you do have problems, you can ask here
[02:12] <yggdrasil> whats wrong
[02:12] <dli> Haydre, however, dapper is not stable yet, so, go to #ubuntu+1
[02:12] <blab|patrick> i am an idiot who doesnt know anything about linux
[02:12] <blab|patrick> beside of the stuff installing a ati driver...
[02:13] <Haydre> dli: no, what I mean is, I don't want to actually upgrade to dapper yet, but I'd like to make use of the repositories, is that possible?
[02:13] <blab|patrick> well i need wifi to get access to the internet
[02:13] <blab|patrick> and i need an answer that explains it step by step
[02:13] <blab|patrick> so that i can boot linux and install my wifi stick
[02:13] <sam_> Haydre: It's possible, but probably a bad idea.
[02:13] <yggdrasil> blap|patrick what card is it.. laptop pci
[02:13] <blab|patrick> ralink 2500 chipset
[02:13] <Haydre> dli: I understand how it would be done, but what types of problems might that cause?
[02:13] <dli> Haydre, I think it's quite a misunderstanding of repos :)  use breezy of dapper, make up your mind
[02:13] <blab|patrick> i have the driver
[02:14] <blab|patrick> wifi stick --> usb2.0
[02:14] <yggdrasil> ralink
[02:14] <yggdrasil> hmm..
[02:14] <blab|patrick> well the onboard driver recognizes the stick, but it sadly doesnt support any wpa
[02:14] <yggdrasil> realteK?
[02:14] <blab|patrick> so i have no other choice but compiling that driver
[02:14] <blab|patrick> RALINK
[02:14] <yggdrasil> oh sorry
[02:14] <yggdrasil> hmm yea that realy does suck
[02:15] <blab|patrick> http://www.ralinktech.com/drivers/Linux/ReleaseNote-USB
[02:15] <yggdrasil> dapper is pretty stable you know
[02:15] <sam_> Haydre: I did apt-pinning back in the pre-Hoary days. It worked but not nearly as smoothly as I was acostomed to.
[02:15] <blab|patrick> well i installed flight7
[02:15] <blab|patrick> and now i try to setup my wifi to get access to the internet and xgl sources ;)
[02:15] <yggdrasil> well i mean its just a proprotions
[02:15] <sam_> It's not like debian testing pinning a few from Sid.
[02:16] <sam_> You've got this huge 6 month gap in the packages.
[02:16] <blab|patrick> yggdrasil: ???
[02:16] <sam_> So you pull in too much of the newer repo.
[02:16] <blab|patrick> i cannot concentrate any longer :/
[02:16] <blab|patrick> i need help :(
[02:16] <yggdrasil> 1sorry blap
[02:16] <yggdrasil> gettign used to irssi
[02:16] <yggdrasil> hmm..
[02:16] <blab|patrick> wtf???
[02:17] <yggdrasil> shoot that link again
[02:17] <Haydre> sam_: Ok, thanks, that was what I was wondering
[02:17] <blab|patrick> http://www.ralinktech.com/drivers/Linux/
[02:17] <blab|patrick> crap doesnt work anymore :/
[02:18] <Haydre> Now if I could just get the latest ATI drivers to work. Has anyone gotten Ati Proprietary drivers 8.25.18 working? I've been having difficulties
[02:18] <blab|patrick> ralinktech.com --> support --> drivers
[02:18] <blab|patrick> linux --> 11g-RT2500 --> usb
[02:18] <philc> anyone seen any weird mouse issues with ubuntu as a vmware host? When I move my mouse into vmware and the mouse is captured, the next time it leaves the vmware window, it can only drag windows around (metacity), not click inside of them. My mouse is completely useless right now. Only way to fix is to restart gdm. Any ideas? It's like the mouse is "stuck" in windows dragging move

[02:19] <yggdrasil> blappatric is this a desktop box or a lappy
[02:19] <blab|patrick> doesnt matter since its a wifi dongle

[02:20] <yggdrasil> im lookin there wich one is it
[02:20] <blab|patrick> 11g-RT2500 --> USB(Source Code)
[02:21] <blab|patrick> well there are so many drivers for 2500 and usb :/
[02:21] <bon_> i have made a mistake of installing the old nvidia drivers i reinstalled the new ones but then it boots up it load the old drivers then i have to "Exit" and log in abaign - can anyone give me any pointers
[02:21] <wims> I spent 30 minutes installing ubuntu, then two hours getting ndiswrapper to work :/
[02:21] <wims> luckily it works now :D
[02:21] <yggdrasil> its T73 (RT2571W)

[02:23] <bon_> anyone got any ideas
[02:24] <blab|patrick> well smone else who has an idea how to compile :/
[02:24] <blab|patrick> i am tired... aparrently i am half sleeping right now
[02:25] <CaptainMorgan> I installed Scsh, how do I get it working once it's been applied using syn?
[02:25] <biovore> blab|patrick: compile what?
[02:25] <blab|patrick> wifi driver
[02:25] <blab|patrick> that ralink - link above
[02:25] <biovore> blab|patrick: isn't that just a kernel module?
[02:25] <blab|patrick> 3) $insmod rt2570.ko     # Insert driver module <-- what does that mean
[02:25] <blab|patrick> biovore: whats a kernel module?
[02:25] <biovore> in linux there are no "drivers" as in windows
[02:26] <biovore> in linux we have modules that plug into the kernel that provide the hardware interface.
[02:26] <blab|patrick> cp Makefile.x Makefile <-- there i replaced x with 6 coze its a 2.6 kernel
[02:26] <blab|patrick> that worked
[02:26] <blab|patrick> then i made $make
[02:26] <blab|patrick> then i made $insmod rt2570.ko
[02:26] <biovore> blab|patrick: sudo insmode rt2570
[02:26] <biovore> insmod
[02:26] <blab|patrick> answer: command not found
[02:26] <bon_> biovore: aka drivers
[02:26] <blab|patrick> what does $ mean?
[02:27] <biovore> no clue
[02:27] <biovore> maybe a bit of bash prompt
[02:27] <Manika> which program should I use to burn an AVI as a playable DVD?
[02:27] <biovore> just do: sudo modprobe rt2570
[02:28] <dli> Manika, I heard k3b can do dvd, but I have no experience
[02:28] <blab|patrick> well http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14653
[02:28] <blab|patrick> there is the complete instruction
[02:28] <blab|patrick> biovore: look at te following steps
[02:28] <Manika> dli: actually it creates the 'audio_ts' and 'video_ts' folders.. but what's next... :P
[02:28] <blab|patrick> i am just now in windows
[02:29] <bon_> jump out the window
[02:29] <bon_> hahaha
[02:29] <biovore> follow those instructions.. the $ means type it at a prompt as root I guess
[02:29] <Blippe> no # means root
[02:29] <Warp2> hello all ... can somebody tell me what LTS stands for?  I see all the ubuntu press now referring to dapper as 6.06 LTS
[02:29] <blab|patrick> what does $ mean then?
[02:29] <Warp2> but nothing clarifies what LTS means
[02:30] <biovore> nothing.. do put it
[02:30] <biovore> (don't)
[02:30] <Blippe> $ is normally the user prompt.
[02:30] <blab|patrick> and why, that was my question since the beginning, do i get the answer that the command rt2570.ko is NOT FOUND
[02:30] <biovore> ^ that what I think its tring to say
[02:30] <biovore> don't put the .ko on the end for modprobe and insmod
[02:30] <titan> is there *any* way to install httpd to Dapper beta?
[02:30] <blab|patrick> what does .ko mean?
[02:30] <biovore> kernel object
[02:31] <dli> titan, sudo apt-get install apache
[02:31] <Blippe> LTS (long-term support)
[02:31] <Warp2> blippe: thansk!
[02:31] <blab|patrick> 3) $insmod rt2570.ko     # Insert driver module <-- how do i insert a driver module there?
[02:31] <Warp2> I wonder why they throw around an acronym like that without ever defining it <shrug>
[02:31] <biovore> I would interpit that line as the following command.  sudo insmod rt2570
[02:32] <Blippe> Warp2, i've seen the definition on every announce
[02:32] <blab|patrick> have u looked over the following instructions? i would be very pleased if i could get it working :D
=== I_Eat_Plastic_ is now known as I_Eat_Plastic
[02:32] <blab|patrick> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14653
[02:33] <green_earz> Manika: you need vod files to build a playable dvd and one tool for dvd authoring is dvdauthor
[02:33] <blab|patrick> what do i have to do in ubuntu syntax at the following steps?
[02:33] <Warp2> in dapper, System->About Ubuntu, it says LTS but never defines it
[02:33] <Warp2> also, I just read http://www.ubuntu.com/news/lamp and it does not define it there either
[02:33] <blaze_> in wich directory are usually programs installed?
[02:33] <blaze_> to know where to store mine
[02:33] <titan> dli, if I do that, I get a list of messages about packages that are not installed / not installable
[02:33] <warpzone> hey guys, has anybody installed the latest ATI drivers that were released?
[02:34] <biovore> blab|patrick: I would replace the $ with a the sudo command..  All those command require root access to do.
[02:35] <dli> titan, try apache2 then :)
[02:35] <dli> titan, if you couldn't figure out deps, ask in #ubuntu+1
[02:36] <blab|patrick> biovore: ok I'll try...
[02:36] <blab|patrick> bb
[02:36] <blab|patrick> btw. my nick is wrong :/

[02:37] <lowheap> hi, i need some help with the ubuntu dapper live cd
[02:37] <lowheap> i need to free some space
[02:37] <dli> lowheap, /j #ubuntu+1
[02:37] <SoulPropagation> Okay, I just installed Ubuntu as a base system and then switched sources.list up to dapper, upgraded, and put in ubuntu-desktop.
[02:38] <SoulPropagation> I did all the package stuff over my wifi card, but now that I'm in GNOME, all I have is lo
[02:38] <titan> dli, apache2 does the same thing, and #Ubuntu+1 tells me I shouldn't be having a problem at all :(
[02:39] <dli> titan, dapper doesn't belong to here, ask in #ubuntu+1, I will have a look there
[02:39] <Blippe> SoulPropagation,  /j #ubuntu+1
[02:39] <dli> SoulPropagation, which card?
[02:40] <Hexidigital_> anyone know of any software similar to M$ office 2003's Onenote?
[02:41] <rapha> Hi all!P
[02:41] <SoulPropagation> dli: I had Ubuntu running fine before; the hard drive fizzled and I just got the new one
[02:41] <rapha> Quick English question... are you invited FROM somebody or invited BY somebody? I'd tend to the latter but am not sure...
[02:41] <Hexidigital_> rapha:: you are correct
[02:41] <Hexidigital_> or you are invited TO something
[02:41] <bon_> this was my google search newbie remote desktop linux vnc
[02:42] <Hexidigital_> bon_:: use VNCviewer
[02:42] <rapha> Hexidigital_: but BY somebody?
[02:42] <Hexidigital_> or Vino
[02:42] <Hexidigital_> yes, rapha
[02:42] <bon_> cool
[02:42] <rapha> thx Hexidigital_ !
[02:42] <Hexidigital_> rapha:: np
[02:45] <Hexidigital_> rapha:: or you have received an invitation from someone
[02:46] <Hexidigital_> it's all about symantecs
[02:46] <rapha> Hexidigital_: but as the label of an html form field? "Invited by...", would that be correct?
[02:46] <Hexidigital_> rapha:: how about "Invitation from..."
[02:47] <Blippe> pancakes are thebetter part of valor!
[02:47] <bla|patrick> biovore: nah
[02:47] <bla|patrick> didnt worked
[02:47] <rapha> Hexidigital_: that's what we argued about. You might have just taken away my victory again :-P
[02:47] <bla|patrick> sudo make --> command make not found
[02:47] <Hexidigital_> sorry rapha
[02:47] <bla|patrick> the same for sudo insmod xyz
[02:47] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: run sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:47] <asdx> what's a good hosting company
[02:47] <bla|patrick> neither with $ or withourt $
[02:48] <rapha> np Hexidigital_ ... would it make a difference whether the invitor was a person or a company?
[02:48] <bla|patrick> 3) $insmod rt2570.ko     # Insert driver module <-- they say i should insert driver module ... what does it mean?
[02:48] <Hexidigital_> rapha:: no
[02:48] <rapha> k, thx Hexidigital_
[02:49] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: first... did you install the build-essential package? that may be messing with what you are doing
[02:49] <Hexidigital_> if not, install than retry your make
[02:49] <racestoapril1> hi, i have a question, whenever i plug my ipod mini into usb, i can view the songs in rhythm box, however i get the error message Could not open vfs file "file:///media/SETH%20THEUER-1/iPod_Control/Music/F03/EHQQ.mp3" for reading.
[02:49] <bla|patrick> Hexidigital_: a what?
[02:50] <bla|patrick> i only have the content of that ralink package
[02:50] <bla|patrick> nothing more nothing less and a clean dapper flight 7
[02:50] <bla|patrick> i have no access to other files
[02:50] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: run this in terminal (without quotes) "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
[02:50] <bla|patrick> Hexidigital_: am in windows... wait llooking for some paper
[02:50] <gnomefreak> if hes running flight 7 he might want to update too
[02:51] <bla|patrick> gnomefreak: scroll up
[02:51] <racestoapril1> can someone help me?
[02:51] <bla|patrick> gnomefreak: i dont tell it here a fifth time why i need that compiling working
[02:51] <Hexidigital_> gnomefreak:: does && work with installing several packages?
[02:51] <Hexidigital_> ie, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:52] <bla|patrick> Hexidigital_: its included into that desktop install disk?
[02:52] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: no
[02:52] <ecoblue> How would I install Macromedia flash player?
[02:52] <Hexidigital_> not that i'm aware of
[02:52] <gnomefreak> you dont need it just list the packages like sudo apt-get install build-essential python pygtk
[02:52] <bla|patrick> Hexidigital_: then tell me how i get that files?
[02:52] <ecoblue> I don't need flash player?
[02:52] <gnomefreak> bla|patrick: um what i meant by that is flight 7 is outdated the rc was released so you might have updates if you didnt run them after install
[02:53] <bla|patrick> in linux i have no access to the web because the native  wifi driver doesnt support wpa2psk
[02:53] <jabra> anyone else having an issue with sqlite3?
[02:53] <bla|patrick> hence i have no wifi
[02:53] <bla|patrick> hence i have no internet
[02:53] <ecoblue> All flash sites don't work\
[02:53] <gnomefreak> ah
[02:53] <bla|patrick> hence i have only that stuff thats on that dics
[02:53] <gnomefreak> your here i figured you had net
[02:53] <bla|patrick> well what can i do now
[02:53] <Hexidigital_> does anyone know if build-essential package is on Flight 7 disc?
[02:53] <bla|patrick> i am in windows as i said 3 minutes ago
[02:54] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: the && seperates commands not packages
[02:54] <racestoapril1> ecoblue: what is your problem? i ran into a similar problem before
[02:54] <Hexidigital_> ah, thx gnomefreak
[02:54] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: i think it iss
[02:54] <gnomefreak> he should beable to grab it with the cdrom repo
[02:54] <Sakara> totally stupid question but how do you delete a file from the command line?
[02:54] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: you MAY be able to install that package from the disc, but it is not guaranteed
[02:54] <gnomefreak> btw gentelman dapper is not supported in this channe;l
[02:54] <gnomefreak> Sakara: rm file
[02:55] <ecoblue> racestoapril1: All flash sites do not work, I downloaded flash, what do I do now?
[02:55] <gnomefreak> or rm /path/to/file
[02:55] <bla|patrick> gnomefreak: well its more likely a general question
[02:55] <Sakara> thanks gnomefreak
[02:55] <bla|patrick> if i install breezy from dekstop cd it would the same
[02:55] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell ecoblue about flash
[02:55] <bla|patrick> i would first need a working wifi driver gnomefreak
[02:55] <bla|patrick> ok?
[02:55] <gnomefreak> bla|patrick: not really since files/packages changed in dapper
[02:55] <bla|patrick> means what?
[02:56] <_pm> what can i use as a personal financial app, like money from ms?
[02:56] <Kyral> KMyMoney?
[02:56] <bla|patrick> Hexidigital_: i'll try it :)
[02:56] <gnomefreak> bla|patrick: dapper and breezy are not the same so alot of things changed if the people in here dont know whats on dapper they might not beable to help so please join #ubuntu+1
[02:56] <racestoapril1> ecoblue: this is the site i figured it out on, http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#flash-mozilla
[02:56] <Hexidigital_> bla|patrick:: yes, give it a shot
[02:56] <racestoapril1> go there

[02:57] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: how did your install go?
[02:58] <paradizelost> which one?
[02:58] <gnomefreak> racestoapril1: dont advise ubuntuguide ever in here please
[02:58] <nickrud_> paradizelost, were you able to follow the guy trying to get his sources right?
[02:58] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: the 2nd attempt failed on you yesterday, last i heard
[02:59] <nathansnook> Is it ok to use kde software in gnome?
[02:59] <racestoapril1> gnomefreak: why? i am new to this and i figured it out on there
[02:59] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: it's on my ex-gf's computer, so  i wasn't able to do more work on it
[02:59] <nickrud_> nathansnook, yes
[02:59] <paradizelost> nickrud_: not sure which one
[02:59] <gnomefreak> !ubuntuguide
[02:59] <ubotu> I heard ubuntuguide is badly out of date,  reported to break a lot and generally a bad source for information. Use help.ubuntu.com or wiki.ubuntu.com instead.
[02:59] <racestoapril1> oh, ok
[02:59] <nickrud_> paradizelost, nm then, he either did or didn't :)
[02:59] <niter3> question guys. I'm trying to enable write access by 'mesg y' , but it's not working..

[03:03] <paradizelost> ilya: i'd just re-install the latest dapper.
[03:03] <paradizelost> :D
[03:04] <ilya> paradizelost: no time for that, and besides this computer is very old and slow, doesn't handle installations well (takes very long, and often crashes)
[03:04] <paradizelost> ilya: make sure that there's a link from /etc/init.d/gdm to /etc/rc2.d/S13gdm

[03:12] <distanceisdeath> yes power is good
[03:12] <gnomefreak> distanceisdeath: change the setting in bios to auto and make sure the jumper is on slave
[03:12] <bla|patrick> u have a ide cable
[03:12] <bla|patrick> 3 connectors
[03:12] <nickrud_> my percentage, see gnomefreak
[03:12] <Sakara> paradizelost: its linux server using a windows client
[03:12] <bla|patrick> one on the mainboard, one in the middle and on eon the other side
[03:12] <paradizelost> Sakara: as in the machine you are connecting to running windows?
[03:13] <rob138> can i repartition a non / harddrive while in ubuntu?
[03:13] <bla|patrick> that on ein the middle is supposed for master drives
[03:13] <bla|patrick> the other one is slave
[03:13] <paradizelost> !harddrive
[03:13] <ubotu> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingANewHardDrive
[03:13] <distanceisdeath> right
[03:13] <distanceisdeath> the ide
[03:13] <Sakara> paradizelost: yes :( have to no Linux boxes at uni
[03:13] <distanceisdeath> says master
[03:13] <bla|patrick> watch the manual to chekc if its jummped correctly...
[03:13] <distanceisdeath> then
[03:13] <drgonzo> hello all
[03:13] <distanceisdeath> the next connector says slave
[03:13] <paradizelost> Sakara: you need to uncheck a box on the machine there
[03:13] <drgonzo> are the au. repo's up yet or should I give it some more time?
[03:13] <bla|patrick> well still smone here who can solve my problem :/
[03:13] <Sakara> paradizelost: I have ssh access to it can you do it at the command line?
[03:14] <drgonzo> au.archive.ubuntu.org etc
[03:14] <ecoblue> When I partitioned my hard drive, it set my window drve to be a linux swap drive, how do I set it up to run windows again without formating it?
[03:14] <Sakara> I am at uni now so dont have physical access to teh box on ssh
[03:14] <paradizelost> Sakara: you have ssh access to a windows machine at the uni?
[03:14] <bla|patrick> ecoblue: u may have destoryed ur windows
[03:14] <nickrud_> ecoblue, you are screwed, I think
[03:14] <ecoblue> That sucks.
[03:14] <kfarrell> Gday, I have set up my drive as LVM, can I add a hard drive and extend it? Is that how LVM works?
[03:14] <ecoblue> Can I access files to make a backup of files?
[03:14] <bla|patrick> if u setup that partition it may accidently got formated to an linux fileformat
[03:14] <Sakara> paradizelost: No I am yusing putty on the windows machines at uni to connect to my Ubuntu machine at home
[03:15] <paradizelost> Sakara: i've never had vnc on a linux box ask for permission to connect
[03:15] <bla|patrick> ecoblue: u may can use a bakcup tool if there have not too many changes snce that setup
[03:15] <paradizelost> on a windows box, there's a box marked
[03:15] <ecoblue> There arn't much changes.
[03:15] <paradizelost> what vnc service are you using?
[03:15] <nickrud_> ecoblue, if I were in your shoes, I'd be totally screwed. Don't boot that machine. Get on another, and maybe there's a howto out there
[03:15] <ecoblue> Except Ubuntu installs.
[03:16] <rob138> can i repartition a non / harddrive while in ubuntu?
[03:16] <ecoblue> I'm running ubuntu right now, I need to back up a partition.
[03:16] <paradizelost> ecoblue: i agree w/ them, your screwed
[03:16] <bla|patrick> ecoblue: that partition is gonna be destroyed more and more as long as ur pc runs
[03:16] <ecoblue> How do I back it up?
[03:16] <Sakara> paradizelost: It is strange I know, when i try to cnnect from a client on the box with the server a msgbox comes up saying do you want to accept the conenction
[03:16] <bla|patrick> u set up a swap file there... that file is continioulsy written if any new data streams from the web
[03:16] <paradizelost> ecoblue: you'll need to do a data recovery program to get it back at this point
[03:16] <bla|patrick> or any applications uses it... whtaver
[03:17] <Sakara> paradizelost: so to get connected via VNC you have to have physical acces to the box
[03:17] <bla|patrick> so turn of  that pc use a 2nd one
[03:17] <nickrud_> ecoblue, if you're taking about backing up the windows data off the partition you made a swap, not going to happen\
[03:17] <bla|patrick> put that drive into that one
[03:17] <Sakara> paradizelost: doesnt that kinda defeat the purpose of VNC?
[03:17] <paradizelost> Sakara: how do you have vnc set up on the box?
[03:17] <bla|patrick> run from tha tpc de recovery software and hope that it finds much of the data
[03:17] <paradizelost> Sakara: i connect to mine all the timme
[03:17] <ecoblue> Ok, I will do that.
[03:17] <kfarrell> I have set up my drive as LVM, can I add a hard drive and extend it? Is that how LVM works?
[03:17] <paradizelost> never once have i had to do that on a linux box
[03:17] <bla|patrick> good luck ecoblue
[03:17] <Sakara> paradizelost: I did it a while ago i went apt-get vnc.. something then vncserver start
[03:17] <ecoblue> Shutiing down to use sencond computer:
[03:18] <Sakara> paradizelost: something like that
[03:18] <bla|patrick> hope nothing important got destoryed
[03:18] <bla|patrick> well... could someone compile a driver for me and build a install container for my ubuntu?
[03:18] <paradizelost> Sakara: are you sure that you are being prompted on the machine?
[03:18] <bla|patrick> i have no access to the internet in linux :/
[03:18] <DarkED> bla|patrick: use partimage
[03:18] <lowheap> are hitachi hard disks good?
[03:18] <bla|patrick> DarkED: ?
[03:19] <paradizelost> lowheap: you mean deathstars?
[03:19] <Sakara> paradizelost: vino, is what i am using, not usre what you mean by promoted
[03:19] <lowheap> deathstars? is that a model?
[03:19] <bla|patrick> nah... scroll up to 2:50 am
[03:19] <bla|patrick> there i explained my issue
[03:19] <DarkED> http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page
[03:19] <paradizelost> Sakara: you said you had to say ok on theh other machene
[03:19] <bla|patrick> well actually its simple
[03:19] <drgonzo> bla|patrick: why would you want interent access anyway?
[03:19] <emptyshell> I was wondering who controls the descriptions for the repositories?
[03:19] <DarkED> download the system rescue cd and use partimage which is on the disc to make a backup of your partition
[03:20] <Sakara> paradizelost: yuyes i have to click yes to a msgbox on the server machine before a client will authenticate
[03:20] <bon_> i was trying to install freenx and i get thios error http://pastebin.com/738469
[03:20] <bla|patrick> drgonzo: because i have to install some packages for media formats?
[03:20] <DarkED> bla|patrick: i did it, works great, it even compresses the image really good
[03:20] <bla|patrick> i cant even play mp3s in a plain install
[03:20] <paradizelost> Sakara: do you want to take over the console session or just have an X session you can connect to?
[03:20] <bla|patrick> DarkED: what are u talking about?
[03:20] <bla|patrick> sry...
[03:20] <DarkED> bla|patrick: you asked someone to compile an image for  you
[03:20] <bla|patrick> i think u got smth wrong? :(
[03:20] <Sakara> X session
[03:20] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, yeah, that sucks. If you have the right chip, I'll help you set up dialup :)
[03:20] <DarkED> bla|patrick: partimage will do it for you, its on that restore cd
[03:20] <bla|patrick> eh...
[03:21] <bla|patrick> nickrud_: its not dial up
[03:21] <paradizelost> i use x11vnc to have access to the console, and vnc4 and just run a window.
[03:21] <Sakara> paradizelost: I want to be able ot view and use the desktop remotely as if i was sat infront of the machine
[03:21] <bla|patrick> its a wifi wpa2 protected wifi network
[03:21] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, you can get dialup long disance any where
[03:21] <bla|patrick> i need a new driver compiled for that matter
[03:21] <paradizelost> Sakara: there can be issues with that.  works most of the time but not all
[03:21] <bla|patrick> nickrud_: dialup is at my router
[03:22] <rob138> if i was going to install OSX, XP, and ubuntu all onto the same (IDE) hard drive, what would be the best order in which to do so?
[03:22] <K-DawG> how do i make a super user?
[03:22] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, so plug in this machine. You're gonna need to bootstrap somehow
[03:22] <bla|patrick> ???
[03:22] <Sakara> paradizelost: it works great if i am at home and am VNC from one machine to another across my desk because i can click accpet on the server but when i am at uni and the box is at home its a bit of a drive to authenticate when i am at uni
[03:22] <paradizelost> Sakara: add this to the end of your /etc/gdm/Init/Default   and just make the appropriate changes
[03:22] <bla|patrick> i have no cable that is long enough to reach the router
[03:23] <orbin> rob138: xp first
[03:23] <rob138> orbin, how come?
[03:23] <bla|patrick> all i can do is begging for help that someone compiles the ralink 2500 - driver for me
[03:23] <bla|patrick> i can install it as deb
[03:23] <orbin> rob138: it overwrites the mbr so you lose grub if you install it after ubuntu
[03:23] <CaptainMorgan> thunderbird is already running, but not responding.... how do I close it? I don't see it
[03:23] <bla|patrick> and then i can run the wifi setups to get access to the web
[03:23] <orbin> rob138: not sure about osx
[03:23] <CaptainMorgan> graphically
[03:24] <paradizelost> x11vnc -scale 0.75 -rfbauth /root/.vnc/passwd -bg -q -forever -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xservers -shared
[03:24] <paradizelost> ^^^^^ Sakara
[03:24] <bon_> nickrud_ : you helped me ages ago to install a hard drive thx :)
[03:24] <njdube> Would it be posible to change the setup in ubuntu so I have the option to enter the specs of my video manually?  I have some old emachine mother board that only disables the on board video when you insert a card....
[03:24] <nickrud_> bon_, yw :)
[03:24] <Malikith> rob138: I think the safest route in my opinion would be XP, OSX, then Ubuntu, but not sure since i've never used OSX
[03:24] <njdube> And every time I try to install kubuntu the screen blacks out when it probes my video.
[03:24] <nickrud_> bon_, when, lol
[03:24] <paradizelost> njdube: if you do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:24] <paradizelost> it will ask you
[03:24] <paradizelost> Sakara: you wil also  need to apt-get install x11vnc
[03:24] <bla|patrick> crap... now its almost the 7th hour and i still havent reached any success with linux - again :/
[03:25] <bla|patrick> isnt there anybody who can help me
[03:25] <bon_> nickrud_ it was months ago but i never thanked you
[03:25] <bla|patrick> i feel fooled here :'(
[03:25] <geeks> there is someone who knows this error ? when i try to install gentoo ( fatal error url )
[03:25] <lowheap> what is better, maxtor or seagate?
[03:25] <nickrud_> bon_, so you're welcome :)
[03:25] <rob138> orbin, can i restore mbr/grub though?
[03:25] <paradizelost> lowheap: maxtor BAD BAD BAD
[03:25] <bla|patrick> seagate bought maxtor... it doesnt matter i guess
[03:25] <njdube> Well how am I suppose to know this?  It would be nice if the ubuntu setup had a button I could click on for either automatic probe or manual setup.  This would be nice for others as well, not just me.  No all of us know every little command to fix these things.
[03:25] <rob138> Malikth, what if i have ubuntu already installed and want to keep it
[03:25] <Malikith> bla|patrick: What do you need done? Compile a ralink 2500 driver?
[03:26] <bla|patrick> ya that one i linked arount 2:50am
[03:26] <orbin> rob138: yes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[03:26] <sip> hola
[03:26] <Sakara> paradizelost: I am getting kicked out of this lab thanks for your help going to email that home and try it when i get home
[03:26] <sip> hell
[03:26] <Malikith> rob138: Yeah orbin's link is probably what you want
[03:26] <sip> hello
[03:26] <nickrud_> bon_, you back for dapper, or just dropping in?
[03:26] <paradizelost> Sakara: you will need to restart gdm
[03:26] <rob138> okay, thanks orbin, Malikith
[03:26] <Flying-Penguin> Hey
[03:26] <paradizelost> but then you should be able to connect to ip.ad.dr.ess:0
[03:26] <Sakara> kk will od
[03:27] <bla|patrick> i need some kind of install container for this http://www.ralinktech.com/drivers/Linux/RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.7.0.tar.gz
[03:27] <Flying-Penguin> When I try to install Ubuntu5.10 it says it is unable to mount the CD-ROM... 0o
[03:27] <Malikith> bla}patrick: Do you have the windows versions of the drivers off hand? You can use ndiswrapper then, but i'll take a look at these source drivers you got here.
[03:27] <bla|patrick> that desktop cds dont have buik essential packages
[03:27] <DarkED> Flying-Penguin: try reburning it at 4x speed
=== jack- is now known as jack
[03:28] <DarkED> Flying-Penguin: more than likely, the cd burn didnt go perfectly, linux isos are like that alot
[03:28] <bla|patrick> i guess ndiswrapper has to be installed first
[03:28] <DarkED> Flying-Penguin: the best way to be sure is to burn at lowest possible speed
[03:28] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, did you check to be sure you have a good iso, see below
[03:28] <bon_> nickrud_ i am still using #   Breezy Badger
[03:28] <nickrud_> !iso
[03:28] <ubotu> it has been said that iso is download Ubuntu at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ and for help burning the CD, please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BurningIsoHowto
[03:28] <nickrud_> erh
[03:28] <bla|patrick> whats impossiible since i hav eno internet connection until i get the wifi workin ^^
[03:28] <nickrud_> !md5sum
[03:28] <ubotu> rumour has it, md5sum is to verify your ISO, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto for Windows see http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[03:29] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, the md5sum one
[03:29] <bon_> nickrud_  : should i try dapper - is it much better
[03:29] <DarkED> bon_: yep
[03:29] <paradizelost> bon_: yes it is much better
[03:29] <DarkED> bon_: its stable now
[03:29] <nickrud_> bon_, I was ondering about whether to mention that :)
[03:29] <Flying-Penguin> nickrud_, where would I run command?
[03:29] <DarkED> bon_: even moreso than breezy in my experience
[03:30] <bon_> cool
[03:30] <orbin> it's stable?  i thought there was this whole "don't use on production machines" thing
[03:30] <DarkED> bon_: be aware, you may need to reconfigure xorg at the first boot
[03:30] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, that wiki page, erm, is not the one that makes sense
[03:30] <paradizelost> orbin: it goes final in 7 days or less....
[03:30] <DarkED> bon_: but thats easily done :D
[03:30] <bla|patrick> orbin: its close to final
[03:30] <bon_> i was going to install bressy on my bros computer but i think i might try dapper
[03:30] <bla|patrick> if it owuld be that bad they couldnt release it
[03:30] <bla|patrick> and its installer is much easier
[03:31] <DarkED> orbin: yes they say that because its a beta release, for legal purposes
[03:31] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, just where does your install fail? Be warned, I know little about the install process
[03:31] <bon_> like it be ok on a slow system
[03:31] <DarkED> orbin: however, it is very stable
[03:31] <bla|patrick> boot to the desktop by cd... click on the install routine, make settings and watch it
[03:31] <Malikith> bla|patrick: I got the drivers to compile, did you read the readme and instructions on how to compile these, and did you install gcc and g++ onto your machine so you are able to compile?
[03:31] <lowheap> are western digital hard disks good?
[03:31] <Flying-Penguin> nickrud_, 0o, Deteck and mount CD-ROM...
[03:31] <bla|patrick> Malikith: i cant compile coze it turns out that the desktop cd hasnt that compile stuff bundled with
[03:31] <DarkED> lowheap: in my experience, yes
[03:31] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, first time boot, or on reboot into system?
[03:32] <bla|patrick> thats why it didnt worked :/
[03:32] <DarkED> lowheap: personally, i have to reccommend seagate, maxtor or fujitsu
[03:32] <lowheap> i had a quantum fireball ex for 8 years and im still using 24/7
[03:32] <bla|patrick> and i cant install gcc or anything else whats an addition COZE I DONT HAVE INTERNET!
[03:32] <DarkED> lowheap: but WD is just as decent, and they come with nice tools
[03:32] <lowheap> i want realiability
[03:32] <Malikith> bla|patrick: Ahh I see, so you're on a machine elsewhere, okay, i'll package these for you then, I won't be able to package these into a dpkg because of the way these things want to install but you won't need any compiling tools now since i've already done it.
[03:32] <DarkED> lowheap: the best part is the tools can be used for any hdd
[03:33] <bla|patrick> ok :)
[03:33] <DarkED> lowheap: ive been running a WD practically 24/7 in my desktop for 5 years
[03:33] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, there's some info on getting dialup :) running under ubuntu, but has some info on getting gcc up and running: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupHowto
[03:33] <DarkED> lowheap: never had a problem, formatted it countless times
[03:33] <bla|patrick> nickrud_: its wlan/wifi not dial up
[03:33] <bla|patrick> is nickrud_ a stupid bot?
[03:33] <nickrud_> blackocellaris, the gcc stuff
[03:33] <nickrud_> read it
[03:34] <nickrud_> blackocellaris, erm, sorry
[03:34] <eric4> Anyone know of a program that comes with ubuntu or that I can get with the package manager that can control the serial port?
[03:34] <bla|patrick> nickrud_: i have no access to gcc, nor to bild-essentials or anything else thats more than the included stuff
[03:34] <nickrud_> eric4, setserial
[03:34] <eric4> Thanks.
[03:34] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, there's some help on getting gcc onto a no net machine there
[03:34] <bla|patrick> crap... i cant stay awake much longer :(
[03:34] <Flying-Penguin> nickrud_, First time boot (IE near start of the hole install prosess)
[03:35] <unix_infidel> what's the command to move out dated packages.
[03:35] <wims> bla|patrick,  build-essentials are on the ubuntu cd
[03:35] <bla|patrick> nickrud_: well easy i code it from scratch :P
[03:35] <unix_infidel> how do i remove packages that are out dated from cache?
[03:35] <wims> you don't need the net for it
[03:35] <bla|patrick> not on flight7
[03:35] <wims> oh
[03:35] <wims> haven't tried it so i wouldn't know
[03:35] <bla|patrick> repos still redirect to that disc
[03:35] <eric4> Hmm, setserial looks like for changing settings of the serial port. I want to send raw hex to the serial port.
[03:35] <Xenguy_> unix_infidel: apt-cache autoclean  ?
[03:35] <nickrud_> Flying-Penguin, I would see if your cd is good first. Other than that I can't help much on installs
[03:35] <eric4> I need the program to be controlled from PHP.
[03:36] <bla|patrick> it didnt find any build-essential packages
[03:36] <Xenguy_> unix_infidel: er, apt-get autoclean
=== Xenguy_ is now known as Xenguy
[03:36] <unix_infidel> Xenguy: :P
[03:37] <unix_infidel> ok, maybe you can answer, what's the threshold on how many days old the package has to be to be removed.
[03:37] <unix_infidel> Xenguy: ^^^^
[03:37] <Xenguy> :-)
[03:38] <unix_infidel> LOL
[03:38] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, hey, it's changed, it used to list the exact packages to download so you had a gcc environment
[03:38] <DarkED> i wish i had like a 300gig drive :D
[03:38] <DarkED> i could back up everything half and half and still have 150gig to play with :D
[03:38] <CharlesE> I am leaning towards fedora core 5 instead of ubuntu I am currently waiting to finish downloading 64bit version of fedora core 5 If it was not for fedora I would be putting ubuntu on it. So my question is can anyone think of any reasons why i should choose ubuntu over fedora?
[03:39] <bla|patrick> hexidigital said i shoul dtry apt-get install build-essential as root
=== bjorn_ is now known as s|k
[03:39] <bla|patrick> i tried and it said no package was found
[03:39] <nickrud_> bla|patrick, yes, that should work if you have your cd in your sources
[03:39] <bla|patrick> its mounted yes
[03:39] <bla|patrick> and its in the repos
[03:39] <ybuntu> Hello Everybody
[03:40] <Malikith> bla|patrick I sent you a pm with the link and everything for your rt25usb drivers
[03:40] <asdx> CharlesE: apt-get, synaptic, community, free cd shipping, etc.
[03:40] <ybuntu> I have some problems
[03:40] <nickrud_> except I have never used a cd as a repo, I should learn that one. oh. Better link available :)
[03:41] <ybuntu> Could someone help me how to find the following library libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3
[03:41] <nickrud_> ah, man apt-cdrom
[03:41] <CharlesE> asdx Yeah, I am used to apt-get it will be weird to not use it. I will try fedora but I am not decided on if ill keep it that depends on if i can get dual monitors working
[03:41] <Inazad> Can I change grub for lilo ?
[03:41] <ybuntu> thank you
[03:41] <bla|patrick> Malikith: i guess u cant see my answers in querys, can u
[03:42] <Malikith> bla|patrick no I don't see anything, but I sent you a pm on irc, strange hehe
[03:43] <Madpilot> bla|patrick, you need to be registered & identified to send PMs on Freenode
[03:43] <bla|patrick> well i think that makes pms obsolit

[03:43] <smeacterne> hi
[03:44] <smeacterne> I am trying to figure out how to convince either the local CompUSA or BestBuy to carry Ubuntu discs
[03:44] <smeacterne> I have enough to keep them stocked for a few weeks
[03:44] <bla|patrick> well what do i have to do Malikith
[03:44] <bla|patrick> that insmod command dint worked either
[03:44] <bla|patrick> btw.
[03:44] <smeacterne> are there any Ubuntu project members in here?
[03:45] <crimsun> smeacterne: quite a few.
[03:45] <Malikith> bla|patrick you did it inside the source directory I would assume, what did it say when you tried to do the command?
[03:45] <bla|patrick> command not found
[03:45] <smeacterne> ok.... to the members: I'm in Miami, Florida USA... I didn't notice a local team anywhere around here... would it be helpful if I formed one?
[03:46] <Madpilot> smeacterne, are you on the Ubuntu Marketing mailing list?
[03:46] <smeacterne> and also - to the members: if you have any suggestions for me in terms of securing local distribution deals with retailers like CompUSA or BestBuy
[03:46] <Malikith> great. hehe, that machine sounds like it has nothing on it, alright, we will get you insmod
[03:46] <smeacterne> no - where is that?
[03:46] <tonyyarusso> smeacterne: If you can find the people to do it, go for it.  There's some really good info on the wiki about LoCo teams.
[03:46] <Malikith> bla|patrick, did you do a sudo insmod by the way
[03:46] <bla|patrick> yep
[03:46] <bla|patrick> even with and with out that dollar letter
[03:47] <smeacterne> I want to get heavily involved with Ubuntu... I've been using it for a while now and am convinced it is the disrtibution that will make it mainstream
[03:47] <smeacterne> I want to help however I can
[03:47] <Madpilot> smeacterne, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarketingTeam and, for the mailing list: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-marketing
[03:47] <bla|patrick> Malikith: its the setup which is supposed to be to bring noobes into the web with linux
[03:47] <bla|patrick> O_o
[03:47] <smeacterne> Madpilot - thanks... I will check those out
[03:47] <bla|patrick> desktop cd without any essential basics :/
[03:48] <smeacterne> I'm in business school - so I might be able to add some value to the marketing mailing list
[03:48] <Manika> how can I enable the firefox update via the Help menu?
[03:48] <bla|patrick> at least wifi drivers should be on board... drivers tha support WPA!!!
[03:48] <Madpilot> smeacterne, cool - there's a #ubuntu-marketing IRC channel too, but the mailing list is probably a better bet - the IRC channel is usually very quiet
[03:49] <verden> hey i have winxp on my /dev/sda1 hdd and ubuntu on my /dev/hdb1 hdd. when i go to mount /dev/sda1 i get this message
[03:49] <verden> mount /dev/sda1
[03:49] <verden> mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1,
[03:49] <verden>        missing codepage or other error
[03:49] <verden>        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
[03:49] <verden>        dmesg | tail  or so
[03:49] <orbin> Manika: you need to chown the /opt firefox dir or something.  see here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[03:49] <nn2> Go ubuntu the easest system out there!!
[03:49] <Manika> orbin: hey! yes, I saw that page, but the option under the 'Help' menu is disabled
[03:49] <orbin> verden: use a pastebin please
[03:50] <bla|patrick> nn2: yeah (if u forget about wifi ;) )
[03:50] <dli> smeacterne, sounds cool , technical people make it, and business people find a way to make a business out of it
[03:50] <verden> how do i use a paste bin?
[03:50] <nn2> dont use it any way
[03:50] <dli> verden, http://pastebin.com
[03:50] <orbin> Manika: did you do the chown thing?
[03:50] <nn2> not secure enuff
[03:51] <verden> ok bye thanx for the help
[03:51] <Manika> orbin: no, just saw that :D thx very much!
[03:51] <smeacterne> dli: I don't plan to make a business out of it in terms of me making money off of it..... but I wouldn't mind helping the project find a way to be profitable enough to ensure long-term sustainability
[03:51] <orbin> verden: and look here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions
[03:51] <orbin> Manika: make sure you chown it back to root like it says
[03:52] <bla|patrick> smeacterne: nice :) but dont bug people as hardcore nerd :D i met once such a guy :)
[03:52] <Manika> orbin: the gksudo method is easier!
[03:52] <dli> smeacterne, I think there should be one, for most home users, using windows is costly, and endless tortures of viruses/spywares, system crashes
[03:52] <verden> i have done that and it doesn't recognise the hdd
[03:52] <bla|patrick> such people make linux fearsome
[03:52] <orbin> smeacterne: i have a feeling ubuntu's gonna be around for a while :)
[03:52] <roostishaw> hello, what is the "golden setup" for linux (particularly ubuntu) in terms of partitioning?
[03:53] <tonyyarusso> roostishaw: There isn't one.
[03:53] <orbin> Manika: yes, yes it is. :)
[03:53] <Healot> "golden setup" >> not sure what you meant by that?
[03:53] <HymnToLife> roostishaw> 10 GB for / 1 GB swap the rest for /home
[03:53] <tonyyarusso> roostishaw: You have to evaluate personal need.
[03:53] <smeacterne> I also am a good writer, so perhaps I can help with the documentation aspects of the project
[03:53] <Madpilot> roostishaw, "golden setup"?
[03:53] <tonyyarusso> I overpartition like mad, personally.
[03:53] <Healot> did you mean automatic/pre-defined partitioning?
[03:53] <smeacterne> I wish I could help maintain something, but honestly my programming skills just aren't up to snuff
[03:53] <Madpilot> smeacterne, #ubuntu-doc, if you're interested
[03:53] <bla|patrick> mine has 18GB for system 50MB for boot and 1,95 for swap :D
[03:53] <HymnToLife> tht's what I'm using at least
[03:53] <roostishaw> :D
[03:54] <dli> smeacterne, but the retailers won't like the idea of free software, because they lose the chance to sell you more
[03:54] <Inazad> Can I change grub for lilo ?
[03:54] <bla|patrick> dli: the problem actually is that intranets are still IE4 focused ;)
[03:54] <bla|patrick> many of em at least
[03:55] <dli> smeacterne, I can see it's not really a technical problem nowadays for ubuntu, it's mature, but need more business people to step in
[03:55] <nickrud_> Inazad, sure, but it only makes sense if your bios doesn't see your drives
[03:55] <tonyyarusso> I have Breezy CDs to unload.  Who might be my best target audience for "Try the Live CD - if you like it, I'll have a brand new version in a few weeks."?
[03:55] <adisucipto> help me!!!
[03:55] <paradizelost> how to i run a command on system startup as a user other than root?
[03:55] <dli> smeacterne, for example, most top hardware sellers still sell you windows, you want it or not
[03:55] <d3a> hi
[03:55] <smeacterne> dli: I was thinking of CompUSA and how they have stocked FreeBSD before, where part of the profit went to the FreeBSD project
[03:55] <Inazad> nickrud_, what are you talking about ?
[03:55] <Manika> in your personal opinion, which one is better: KDE or GNOME? :D
[03:55] <bla|patrick> tonyyarusso: they call it desktop cds and taht new installer is much smarter
[03:55] <adisucipto> Why I cannot entering my root
[03:55] <paradizelost> i tried crontab @reboot /path/to/script but it gives an error about @REBOOT
[03:55] <smeacterne> so maybe there is some way to convince them that carrying free software is beneficial
[03:55] <bla|patrick> :D
[03:56] <smeacterne> I wouldn't want them to sell it though
[03:56] <dli> smeacterne, then, they lose profit from windows
[03:56] <roostishaw> HymnToLife, so if I put my home dir on  a seprate partition, I would just mount it when I wanted access to it?
[03:56] <Inazad> Manika, GNOME it's faster than KDE but KDE is more beautiful than GNOME... my opinion
[03:56] <smeacterne> I once saw that the Apple Store sells Open-Office rebranded as their own product
[03:56] <bla|patrick> i tried it and even my mother might have been able to install her own copy of ubuntu ;)
[03:56] <smeacterne> it pissed me off
[03:56] <Madpilot> smeacterne, nothing wrong with selling Ubuntu
[03:56] <dli> smeacterne, but I am quite an idiot with how a business runs :(
[03:56] <tonyyarusso> Manika: (Take that to #ubuntu-offtopic so it doesn't flood here.)
[03:56] <paradizelost> smeacterne: there is nothing wrong wit that
[03:56] <Opticalia> SysInfo: Linux 2.6.12-10-386 |  AMD Athlon(tm) XP 3200+ 2199.708 MHz | Bogomips: 4358.14 | Mem: 455/1011M [||||||||||]  | Diskspace: 294.67G Free: 82.75G | Procs: 97 | Uptime: 12 hrs 47 mins 45 secs | Load: 1.81 1.81 1.27  | Vpenis: 108.4 cm | Vboobies: 55G | Screen: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 AR [Radeon 9600]  @ 1280x1024 (24 bpp) | ppp0: In: 798.57M Out: 1.53G
[03:56] <nickrud_> Inazad, I've use lilo a lot, but the grub installer in ubuntu is reasonably intelligent. I'm just saying that unless you have a good reason, why not use it?
[03:57] <smeacterne> Madpilot - nothing wrong with it at all... so long as the Ubuntu project would see money from its sales
[03:57] <Inazad> nickrud_, grub it's ugly.. lol I want a beautiful loader
[03:57] <bla|patrick> Malikith: well i cant fight against sleep much longer :/
[03:57] <HymnToLife> roostishaw> yes, and since you need access to it al the time, you'll have it mounted all the time :)
[03:57] <smeacterne> what I meant... is that I wouldn't want to be providing CompUSA with discs for them to sell and keep all the money
[03:57] <bla|patrick> any idea?
[03:57] <nickrud_> Inazad, then have fun. It's linux :)
[03:57] <dli> smeacterne, that's why I think people can creat a business out of ubuntu, it's so useful to most home users
[03:57] <paradizelost> smeacterne: so sell them to them
[03:57] <bla|patrick> well thank you everybody until now for ur help :D
[03:57] <Inazad> nickrud_, ya.. i know, but where I can find some doc about changing the boot loader ?
[03:58] <paradizelost> and donate a part of the profits to canonical
[03:58] <Gr3ml1n_> hi
[03:58] <tonyyarusso> smeacterne: Yeah, charge CompUSA and send the money back to the Ubuntu Foundation.
[03:58] <roostishaw> HymnToLife, ok... hmm... so then whenever I needed to reinstall, I would tell the installer to only install to the "system" partition?
[03:58] <Gr3ml1n_> where are vmware images of the latest ubuntu?
[03:58] <nickrud_> Inazad, google lilo heaven, it's easily adapted
[03:58] <orbin> Inazad: it lasts 5 seconds :)  then you have usplash to look at
[03:58] <HymnToLife> Inazad> during Ubuntu install you can choose to install LILO insted of GRUB but it' a bit hidden
[03:58] <Inazad> nickrud_, I type "lilo heaven" ?
[03:58] <smeacterne> paradizelost - was thinking possibly of something like that... should I contact the project regarding getting authorization to do something like that, as well as estimating a market price?
[03:59] <HymnToLife> roostishaw> exactly, ad keep the /home untouched so all your files and setting will stil be there
[03:59] <paradizelost> smeacterne: there is no authorization needed, it's GPL, i just wouldn't get the disks from shipit and go selling them
[03:59] <dli> smeacterne, I suppose you can do that without sending money back to ubuntu
[04:00] <paradizelost> but legally, nothinng stops you from re-doing ubuntu your own distro, so long as you give proper credit where it is due.
[04:00] <bla|patrick> well.. does someone know when Malikith is online generally?
[04:00] <bla|patrick> i*ll be bakc tomorrow then
[04:00] <roostishaw> HymnToLife, right now its all on one hdd (plus the swap). How do I do what we just described?
[04:00] <smeacterne> dli - that defeats the point - I want the money to go back to Ubuntu
[04:00] <fogos> ho someone knows what mean this error when installin php-gtk2 "checking for PHP executable in /usr/bin... configure: error: Could not locate PHP executable"
[04:01] <bla|patrick> dont they have a million dollars smeacterne
[04:01] <todayscultleader> Gr3mlin> google for vmware ubuntu
[04:01] <dli> smeacterne, I understand your point, I just mean the authorization part, not really needed
[04:01] <bla|patrick> and a plan to conquer business?
[04:01] <smeacterne> for a corporation - that's slim
[04:01] <smeacterne> dli- oh ok
[04:01] <PVZ> what does "sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0644, should be 0440" mean?
[04:01] <bla|patrick> smeacterne: its a community project
[04:01] <paradizelost> Gr3ml1n you having vmware issues?
[04:01] <bla|patrick> with a few devs
[04:02] <smeacterne> bla|patrick - look at Red Hat's 2005 growth and earnings
[04:02] <smeacterne> as well as their P/E ration
[04:02] <smeacterne> that's the potential open-source has
[04:02] <smeacterne> I want Ubuntu to be at that point within 10 years
[04:02] <bla|patrick> well do u have som numbers?
[04:02] <nickrud_> PVZ, it means that for some reason (possibly because you edited it) that the permissions on the file /etc/sudoer are wrong
[04:02] <smeacterne> bla|patrick - one sec... I'll grab them
[04:02] <dli> smeacterne, I don't know business, but to me red hat really sucks with their RPM scheme
[04:02] <nickrud_> PVZ, erm, /etc/sudoers
[04:03] <nickrud_> PVZ, do you have a root account?
[04:03] <PVZ> nickrud_, erm,not exactly
[04:03] <nickrud_> PVZ, good :)
[04:03] <paradizelost> PVZ: is this a system you are supposed to have full control over?
[04:03] <bla|patrick> Malikith: sorry i am overdone now... good night/evening/morning/whatever :P
[04:03] <smeacterne> dli - agreed
[04:03] <PVZ> paradizelost, yes,i am the only user in this computer
[04:04] <PVZ> and it's mine by the way :)
[04:04] <bla|patrick> be back tommorow at 22pm gmt+1
[04:04] <bla|patrick> bye
[04:04] <smeacterne> bla|patrick - bye
[04:04] <nickrud_> PVZ, reboot in recovery mode, you should get a place to type coommands. If you do, type chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers , and reboot
[04:04] <smeacterne> ok guys... Red Hat's deferred revenue last year was $223.5 mil US
[04:04] <PVZ> nickrud_, ok,I'll do it
[04:05] <PVZ> thank you
[04:05] <smeacterne> 12% sequential growth
[04:05] <smeacterne> quarterly cash flow alone had 64% growth
[04:05] <paradizelost> smeacterne: part of what helps redhat though is that they have an industry standard linux certification
[04:05] <paradizelost> AND their in bed w/ ibm
[04:05] <disinterested_pe> ftp://ftp.nerim.net hasnt been working any other sites where i can get w32 codecs for realplayer
[04:05] <smeacterne> it's still small for a major corporation.... but it's getting there
[04:06] <paradizelost> AND vmware
[04:06] <smeacterne> paradizelost - yeah... the cert is important it seems
[04:06] <paradizelost> disinterested_pe: you could try easyubuntu
[04:06] <paradizelost> !easyubuntu
[04:06] <ubotu> [easyubuntu]  an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
[04:06] <smeacterne> I wouldn't put it out of reach for Ubuntu though
[04:06] <smeacterne> it's fesible - just now now
[04:06] <smeacterne> not now
[04:06] <disinterested_pe> ive got easyubuntu installed
[04:06] <paradizelost> disinterested_pe: did you have it install all of the codecs?
[04:07] <Madpilot> smeacterne, #ubuntu-offtopic to continue this, please - it's interesting, but this is supposed to be a tech support channel
[04:07] <disinterested_pe> idk where do i find out?
[04:07] <s|k> heh
[04:07] <orbin> disinterested_pe: i think they're also in seveas' repos iirc
[04:07] <smeacterne> Madpilot - no problem... sorry to spam up the channel
[04:07] <paradizelost> disinterested_pe: run easyubuntu and check the box.
[04:07] <paradizelost> :D
[04:07] <jdong|coreduo> is there a way of getting edubuntu LTSP goodness but without the branding?
[04:07] <disinterested_pe> ok
[04:07] <jdong|coreduo> i.e. I'd like to set up an effort-free Ubuntu thin client system
[04:08] <paradizelost> jdong|coreduo: there's no such thing as effort-free, but LTSP should do the trick
[04:08] <paradizelost> check #ltsp for instructions
[04:08] <jdong|coreduo> paradizelost: alright, I'll see what happens if I install ltsp :)
[04:08] <jdong|coreduo> what is required on the client side?
[04:09] <pablo> hello!
[04:09] <jdong|coreduo> (ltsp-client. duh)
[04:09] <pablo> is it possible to mount a ftp location?
[04:09] <babo> is dapper nearly ready ?
[04:09] <patch> hello putitios !
[04:09] <paradizelost> jdong|coreduo: a PXE compliant NIC
[04:10] <Madpilot> babo, nearly. Final release is June 1st
[04:10] <paradizelost> pablo: why do you want to mount an FTP server to a location on the HDD?
[04:10] <dli> pablo, why not use nfs ?
[04:10] <paradizelost> agrees w/ ^^^
[04:10] <babo> Madpilot: it's good to go now though right ?
[04:11] <pablo> paradizelost: what type of media is nfs?
[04:11] <Madpilot> babo, probably, but it's still officially in beta
[04:11] <babo> Madpilot: will easyubuntu work with dapper ... ? I need to load in some propietary stuff and I don't want to wait around ...
[04:11] <paradizelost> NFS=Network File System
[04:11] <Madpilot> babo, I've no idea. try #easyubuntu
[04:11] <paradizelost> think of it like windows shares, just for linux, and not SMBFS
[04:11] <babo> ok thanks ...
[04:12] <paradizelost> babo: i've used easyubuntu on dapper and it seems to work fine
[04:12] <babo> paradizelost: cool, I need things like flash, java, skype ...
[04:12] <paradizelost> no notieceable side-effect though
[04:12] <pablo> paradizelost: so can you use nfs to point to an ftp location?
[04:12] <paradizelost> pablo: no, it is its own type
[04:13] <paradizelost> why do you want to mount an FTP site?
[04:13] <paradizelost> i've NEVER seen it done, btw
[04:13] <paradizelost> babo: if you want flash8 it's easy enough to do  as well, but with wine/crossoveroffice
[04:13] <pablo> paradizelost: i want to work with FTP files as if I am in a local directory.
[04:13] <Inazad> Does Ubuntu are bad than Debian?
[04:13] <paradizelost> Inazad: WTF?
[04:13] <paradizelost> that made no sense
[04:14] <Healot> Inazad: define: bad
[04:14] <paradizelost> is ubuntu worse than debian? is that what your asking?
[04:14] <pablo> bad = worse than/
[04:14] <babo> paradizelost: I hate wine ... I just need my browser to stop crashing when it hits flash pages ... I don't really care much about flash one way or the other ...
[04:14] <paradizelost> babo: i've never had a browser crash because it hit a flash page and didn't have the plugin
[04:14] <paradizelost> what browser are you using?
[04:14] <Inazad> Healot, causing trouble to Debian ?
[04:15] <Madpilot> paradizelost, you can add FTP links to Nautilus - not sure if you think of that as "mounting" them or not, but it's very seamless.
[04:15] <paradizelost> Inazad: about as much trouble as mandrake causes redhat...
[04:15] <Inazad> paradizelost, I'm reading an article on the net (forum..) some guys are crazy and they hate Ubuntu... I said FU to theirself! lol
[04:15] <Inazad> paradizelost, I'm agree with u
[04:15] <emiliano> hi
[04:15] <Gr3ml1n> (04:01:52) (paradizelost) Gr3ml1n you having vmware issues? <-- no, vmware works fine, i just need an image of the latest ubuntu
[04:16] <paradizelost> ahh.
[04:16] <Madpilot> Inazad, http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship <-- please read that
[04:16] <paradizelost> Gr3ml1n: just download the latest livecd and boot it....
[04:16] <Gr3ml1n> i need a vmware image
[04:16] <babo> paradizelost, firefox ... although, I happened to wipe out my /home folder a while back and had to reinstall from synaptic. I'm on 64 bit and I'm assuming that for some reason the 32 bit version of 1.0 got installed. Regardless, I'm wiping the system and starting over with dapper. I never was able to get skype to work on 64bit, even after chrooting and tracking down dependcies ...
[04:16] <pablo> Madpilot: i'm gonna try you tip about adding ftp links to nautilus. <brb>
[04:16] <Inazad> Madpilot, understood
[04:17] <emiliano> can anybody help me? Im running UBUNTU5.10
[04:17] <emiliano> When I connect my cam, my pc tilts
[04:17] <Madpilot> pablo, File-->Connect to Server, choose FTP, enter your FTP account info. Done.
[04:17] <cocox> hey dudes, i check out the ping's man and i didn't find the way to resolve the dns name of an ip address :S can anybody help me plz ?
[04:18] <paradizelost> babo: i've had very bad luck on 64bit
[04:18] <emiliano> Im new in Linux and UBUNTU
[04:18] <pablo> Madpilot: thanks :)
[04:18] <Sven_vB> hi :)
[04:18] <Gr3ml1n> heeeeeelp i need a vmware image of the latest ubuntu ;P
[04:18] <paradizelost> cocox: uhh, one ip can havve thousands of dns names
[04:18] <Sven_vB> i have 64 MB RAM, how much swap should i use?
[04:18] <paradizelost> Gr3ml1n: i doubt anyone will provide as it would be like 3gb
[04:18] <Madpilot> emile, what do you mean by "tilt"?
[04:19] <Healot> Sven_vB: twice the ram or more would be better
[04:19] <paradizelost> Sven_vB: you still have  a computer w/ only 64mb ram?
[04:19] <paradizelost> i haven't seen one of those in a long itme
[04:19] <paradizelost> time
[04:19] <babo> paradizelost: yeah, me too ... I'm trying to run a home business on this computer and I really don't need the hassle of 64bit anymore. The performance enhancement is negligible anyway IMO ...
[04:19] <Sven_vB> paradizelost: yes. it worked nice with Win2k, so i think with Debian t should work even better
[04:19] <K-DawG> does any1 have a good guid how to install Nvidia 386 drivers?
[04:19] <emiliano> mmm..... stop running....
[04:19] <paradizelost> babo: i'd just load the i386 version of ubuntu
[04:20] <emiliano> sorry for my bad englich
[04:20] <emiliano> english
[04:20] <Gr3ml1n> (04:18:47) (paradizelost) Gr3ml1n: i doubt anyone will provide as it would be like 3gb <-- i don't need a full install. i need something i can start with. for example a net install environment.
[04:20] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell K-DawG about nvidia
[04:20] <charlesJacobs> K-DawG: tseliot has a nice guide on the forums www.ubuntuforums.org
[04:20] <ollo82> K-DawG: sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx
[04:20] <s|k> no nvidia-glx is terrible
[04:20] <paradizelost> Gr3ml1n: well, you may want to specify EXACTLY what you are asking for
[04:20] <paradizelost> :D
[04:20] <paradizelost> grb
[04:20] <paradizelost> brb
[04:20] <s|k> use the proprietary driver
[04:21] <bon_> i have installed freenx but ihow do i seet the password and such
[04:21] <ollo82> my nvidia-glx is working good
[04:21] <s|k> there's a thread on tips & tricks on the ubuntu forums that explains how to install the propietary drivers
[04:21] <cocox> paradizelost, and there is a way to know each one ??
[04:22] <freddy> hello, is it posible to upgrade from 5.04 to the recent version?
[04:22] <spikeb> !tell freddy about upgrade
[04:22] <babo> paradizelost: yes, I'll download 32bit dapper and work away on that. If i want a computer for linux hacking I'll grab an old P3 and start building LFS ...
[04:22] <babo> :-)
[04:22] <cocox> babo, LFS ??
[04:23] <Madpilot> Linux From Scratch
[04:23] <cocox> oic
[04:23] <Healot> a.k.a your own distro :)
[04:24] <spikeb> LFS is fun
[04:24] <paradizelost> cacops: which one what? had to let the dog out, lost track of the convo
[04:24] <cocox> wtf means or is linux from scratch ???
[04:25] <litage> hey guys, hey guys, i know that the first 3 #s within /proc/loadavg are the load average for the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes, but how do you interpret those numbers? ie: how do 0.28, 0.89, 1.27, etc compare to each other?
[04:25] <DrCurl> Hello
[04:25] <coraka> bonsoir
[04:25] <qatsi> hey, is it safe to update to Dapper Drake now, or should i wait till next month for the full version to be released ?
[04:25] <DrCurl> I just saw that release candidate is ut, should I install it or wait for official release?
[04:25] <paradizelost> qatsi: i've been running it for a copule of weeks now, runs fine for me
[04:25] <Madpilot> cocox, it's another version of Linux, except you have to compile everything - hence the 'From Scratch" part of the name...
[04:26] <Madpilot> DrCurl, your call - it is still a test release...
[04:26] <paradizelost> Madpilot: sounds like gentoo to me...
[04:26] <paradizelost> :D
[04:26] <qatsi> paradizelost: ok, then, ill update, and when the full version comes public, ill update...
[04:26] <qatsi> paradizelost: thank you :)
[04:26] <cocox> Madpilot, just for haxors ?
[04:26] <DrCurl> When Dapper will be officialy out, it will only be a mather of updating to the latest package?
[04:26] <DrCurl> if I install rc
[04:26] <Madpilot> cocox, no idea, I've got better things to do than compile stuff I can just apt-get...
[04:26] <Madpilot> DrCurl, yes
[04:27] <cocox> Madpilot, lol
[04:27] <babo> cocox: Linux From Scratch ...
[04:27] <paradizelost> well all, i'll brb, gotta reboot the server so it stops nagging.
[04:27] <cocox> roflawtite
[04:27] <DrCurl> Madpilot, do you think that there will still be major updates like in previous beta/flight where xorg was updated almost every day?
[04:28] <Madpilot> DrCurl, I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.
[04:28] <DrCurl> ok
[04:30] <niki> is there a console command to play a sound file?
[04:30] <disinterested_pe> i cant find any easyubuntu.deb files
[04:32] <Firezip_> I need help installing steam using wine
[04:32] <disinterested_pe> which version of easyubuntu will install in breezy
[04:32] <Firezip_> I have it installed
[04:32] <Firezip_> now I can't seem to get it to run
[04:32] <DrCurl> thanks for the info Madpilot
[04:32] <gagamel> hi, i installed ssh and sshd daemon is live,  but i can't access remote server. how do i access remote server with ssh
[04:33] <EcoBlue> Well, windows dun got pwned.
[04:33] <EcoBlue> The file system corrupted.
[04:33] <gagamel> auth.log is written that (pam_unix) check pass; user unknoun, authentication failure
[04:34] <eightball> do i have to use synaptic or apt-get to install kde on ubuntu 5.10? or is there an easier way, such as off the regular install cd?
[04:35] <babo> where can I download the latest dapper ?
[04:36] <ejer> babo: linuxtracker.org
[04:36] <babo> ejer: thanks ...
[04:36] <ollo82> is there a gnome based gui for samba to share files?
[04:37] <Madpilot> babo, http://releases.ubuntu.com/dapper/
[04:37] <babo> Madpilot: even better, thanks :-)
[04:37] <bimberi> ollo82: System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
[04:38] <EcoBlue> What programs allow me to emulate windows games and programs on ubuntu?
[04:38] <crush_> hi
[04:39] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, wine, cedega, crossover office, qemu
[04:39] <charlesJacobs> EcoBlue: wine
[04:39] <Healot> EcoBlue: in Linux in general, it's "cedega"
[04:39] <bimberi> ubotu tell EcoBlue about wine
[04:39] <crush_> how i use wine??
[04:39] <K-DawG> how do i change resolution an Hrz?
[04:39] <babo> hmmm this sentence from the dapper release page doesn't make sense ...
[04:39] <babo> The desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later.
[04:39] <bimberi> ubotu tell crush_ about wine
[04:40] <bimberi> babo: once the live component boots there's an icon on the desktop to kick off the installer
[04:41] <ollo82> bimberi: i dont have that? to which package belongs this
[04:41] <EcoBlue> Where would I find wine in the Synaptic package installer?
[04:42] <bimberi> ollo82: It applies to the Dapper CD image
[04:42] <ollo82> it must be in a package, but which?
[04:42] <EcoBlue> bimberi: Where would I find wine in the Synaptic package installer?
[04:42] <Healot> for the current release, breezy, none, but there are third parties packages, or you can build it yourself, EcoBlue
[04:43] <EcoBlue> Where would I find the latest stable uild?
[04:43] <bimberi> EcoBlue: it can be installed via the universe repository but it's an old version ...
[04:43] <EcoBlue> *build
[04:43] <bimberi> !wine
[04:43] <ubotu> compatibility for running windows programs on linux.  Get the latest .deb from http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/binary/  or see for wine repo https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wine for more support join #winehq
[04:43] <disinterested_pe> ok so i cant get easy ubuntu installed i thought it was but its not?
[04:43] <bimberi> eww, that factoid's a bit rough
[04:44] <wiwi> holas
[04:44] <wiwi> alguien
[04:44] <Healot> hablen anglais, wiwi?
[04:45] <wiwi> alguien hablas espaol
[04:45] <K-DawG> does any1 know hot to chage the resoilution?? i can only use 1024
[04:45] <wiwi> holas
[04:46] <babo> bimberi: you can install straight from the live OS ?
[04:46] <charlesJacobs> K-DawG: CTRL+ALT+F2, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[04:46] <deshantm> how do you make sure that a splash image is 16 colors?
[04:46] <wiwi> hello
[04:46] <charlesJacobs> oh
[04:46] <Madpilot> !es
[04:46] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[04:46] <charlesJacobs> K-DawG: and then sudo gdm start
[04:47] <bimberi> babo: yep
[04:47] <bintrue> just a quick question... how long should the CD integrity check take on the new rc?
[04:47] <bimberi> babo: it's a very nice piece of work
[04:48] <nickrud_> bintrue, several minutes, no more
[04:48] <babo> bimberi: we're talking about dapper now right ?
[04:49] <bintrue> if it takes 15 minutes to go 9% is it safe to assum something is wrong?
[04:49] <cocox> how can i list the services running in my pc ???????????
[04:49] <nickrud_> I'd worry
[04:49] <bimberi> babo: yes
[04:49] <wiwi> help
[04:49] <nickrud_> cocox, sudo netstat -plant
[04:49] <wiwi> help
[04:49] <deshantm> i keep getting the warning: large integer implicity truncated to unsigned type... i think it is because the image is not 16 colors.. any ideas?
[04:49] <wiwi> help
[04:49] <nickrud_> !ask

[04:51] <bintrue> haha
[04:51] <bintrue> nice dream
[04:51] <nickrud_> nightmare
[04:51] <EcoBlue> Will wine run games?
[04:52] <wiwi> soy nuevo en ubuntu
[04:52] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, sometimes, but googling your game & linux probably points you at cedega
[04:52] <bintrue> hmm my md5 hash matches up... wonder what could be wrong. The install seems to take forever as does the "Check CD for defects"
[04:52] <bimberi> it runs solitaire quite well
[04:52] <Gr3ml1n> nickrud_: no joke -,- i was dreaming i got those things from a print publisher out of business lol
[04:52] <wiwi> y quiero instalar amarok como lo ago
[04:52] <Gr3ml1n> and i asked if they had any computers left
[04:52] <cocox> nickrud_, i mean services like telnet, ftp like that
[04:52] <Gr3ml1n> and then the ex-boss leads me to a room
[04:52] <Gr3ml1n> with 300 old macs
[04:52] <wiwi> helpme
[04:53] <cocox> nickrud_, there i just can see the sockets connections
[04:53] <Gr3ml1n> and i was like "woooow ill install a cluster"
[04:53] <Gr3ml1n> and then i woke up
[04:53] <nickrud_> cocox, that command shows the tcp services, and their port, & the program running it
[04:53] <Gr3ml1n> well
[04:53] <Gr3ml1n> n8 ;P
[04:53] <nickrud_> Gr3ml1n, gentoo is the nightmare part :)
[04:53] <Gr3ml1n> nickrud_: ever heard of cloning? ;P those 300 macs were all the same model HEHE
[04:54] <cocox> nickrud_, ,mmmm and there is a way to look, doing for example something like "net status telnet"
[04:54] <cocox> ?
[04:54] <Gr3ml1n> dude i even dont have any idea about powerpc linux or clusters but still i have such a weird dream
[04:54] <Gr3ml1n> it was a real sick experience
[04:55] <Gr3ml1n> i hope it continues this night
[04:55] <nickrud_> cocox, probably, but I cut to the chase & query the lowest common denominator: sudo netstat -plant
[04:55] <Gr3ml1n> lol
[04:55] <nickrud_> cocox, telent will show up there
[04:56] <cocox> nickrud_, did you ever try to make an "sudo nmap yourpublicipaddress" and compare it with "netstat -plant" ???
[04:56] <Firezip_> Hey guys, whats a good cheap labtop that will run ubuntu for everyday tasks?
[04:56] <randomguy> hey do you hook a zip100 drive to a cdrom drive or an hard drive
[04:56] <nickrud_> cocox, sure.
[04:56] <randomguy> and do you set it to master or slave
[04:56] <bintrue> Firezip_ check out www.linux-laptops.net
[04:56] <nickrud_> cocox, there are scanners out there that are happy to check your ports
[04:57] <bintrue> www.grc.com
[04:57] <Firezip_> bintrue thanks for the link
[04:57] <randomguy> can i have some help?
[04:57] <disinterested_pe> y do i get errors when im trying to install easyubuntu?
[04:57] <nickrud_> randomguy, maybe :)
[04:57] <randomguy> lol thanks
[04:57] <nickrud_> disinterested_pe, ask on #easyubuntu, they're seriously interested
[04:58] <cocox> nickrud_, yea but for example nmap shows me my active services http,ftp and telnet .... and when i do a netstat this doesnt show me those services running :S im quite confused
[04:58] <disinterested_pe> ok
[04:58] <yoyoyo> im having problems with my mp3 playback. in beepmedia player, the file plays fine. i put it into cinerella and its all static.
[04:58] <ejer> randomguy: what is yr q
[04:58] <randomguy> do you hook a zip100 drive to a cdrom drive or an hard drive
[04:58] <deshantm> FYI: the way to make a image 16 colors is to use convert with the -colors option
[04:58] <sflash>  i have a server set up at my house. i just want to give write permissions for a php script to write to a folder in my /home/siavash/extdrv/temp directory
[04:58] <nickrud_> cocox, I've never had any services that sudo netstat didn't see, but I've never been hacked (probably not you, either)
[04:59] <deshantm> thanks :)
[04:59] <bintrue> this is getting annoying... While installing Ubuntu, my screen never gets off the first screen. My cdrom is spinning madly and I get a little green "loading" but nothing else
[04:59] <ejer> randomguy: neither?
[04:59] <ejer> randomguy: does it not hook to scsi? I hav never used one...
[05:00] <TiG4> ---Hey I am trying to upgrade to dapper from Breezy, but I get an error in update-manager saying "can't install ubuntu-desktop - it was impossible to install..." any ideas?
[05:00] <yoyoyo> can somebody help me with mp3 playback? the same mp3 file plays fine in beepmedia player and totem, but is all fuzzy in cinerella. can somtbody help?
[05:00] <cocox> nickrud_, me neither.... but try it ?? nmap shows something and netstat dont...
[05:01] <nickrud_> TiG4, you removed ubuntu-desktop before?
[05:01] <sflash> anyone know how to give write permissions to my mounted usb drive? i can view the files but cante write to them
[05:01] <ejer> yoyoyo: try decompressing to wav be4 cinelerra
[05:01] <TiG4> nickrud_, i don't think so
[05:01] <yoyoyo> ejer: whats the command line for it?
[05:01] <TiG4> nickrud_,
[05:01] <Dr_Willis> sflash,  what filesystem?
[05:01] <TiG4> nickrud_, should i have?
[05:01] <nickrud_> TiG4, try this: dpkg -l ubuntu-desktop  ; the first two characters should be ii
[05:02] <nickrud_> TiG4, I'm assuming you have a breezy install, and want to upgrade via update-manager

[05:03] <ejer> yoyoyo: no clue
[05:03] <TiG4> nickrud_, thats the output
[05:03] <yoyoyo> ejer: what program could do that?
[05:03] <nickrud_> TiG4,  ok. you need to set your sources to breezy, install ubuntu-desktop, then do the dapper upgrade
[05:03] <yoyoyo> ejer: google brings up nothing about staticy mp3s
[05:03] <nickrud_> TiG4, it's a well known issue
[05:03] <TiG4> nickrud_, set sources to breezy? in syn?
[05:04] <yoyoyo> ejer: w/e thanks for your help
[05:04] <NitroRebel> Hello, I have a great install of Xubuntu 6.06, and was playing around with stuff. Using SYnaptic to install a game, I couldn't locate the file. Anywhere.. Does anyone have any ideas, or is there just no way to play the little mediocre arcade games with Xfce?
[05:04] <nickrud_> TiG4, hm.
[05:05] <Dr_Willis> NitroRebel,  theres always a way
[05:05] <TiG4> nickrud_, how do i set sources to breezy?
[05:05] <marsswell> which is the command to upgrade breezy to dapper?
[05:05] <TiG4> nickrud_, im installing ubuntu-desktop in synatic
[05:05] <TiG4> nickrud_, synaptic
[05:05] <nickrud_> TiG4, if you would, copy the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ . Just so I can see where we're starting
[05:05] <Healot> enable the deb-src repos in /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:05] <nickrud_> marsswell, if all is good, sudo update-manager -d
[05:06] <odyssey> hello
[05:06] <Firezip_> will a 16mb videocard run ubuntu good?

[05:06] <gteppel> Is it possible to tunnel PPTP VPN over SSH? I have a laptop that is sometimes in a wireless network that only allows Port 80 & 443 outbound so I setup my sshd server on my debian box to run over 443. I've been able to ssh to my box like this and I've been able to forward ports over this tunnel (3389 RDP, 5222 Jabber, etc...) but I'm not sure how to tunnel VPN over SSH, what ports does it use?. The reason I need to VPN is so I can vpn i
[05:06] <TiG4> nickrud_, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14654
[05:07] <odyssey> i just install the ubuntu 6.06 rc is that the official version of dapper drake
[05:07] <bimberi> odyssey: that's the latest yes
[05:08] <bintrue> gteppel pptp runs on 1723
[05:08] <gteppel> bintrue: ok thanks
[05:08] <bintrue> gteppel google knows all!
[05:08] <TiG4> nickrud_, i installed ubuntu-desktop , now i get the error, "could not calculate the upgrade: an unresolvable problem occured while calculating the upgrade"
[05:08] <odyssey> so the release in june wont be any different..
[05:09] <bintrue> odyssey, only if they don't find problems I would assume
[05:09] <bintrue> why else would they release something again?
[05:09] <marsswell> nickrud_, I got it. Thanks very much for now!
[05:10] <bintrue> I sure wish I could install this... maybe I just go back to 5.10
[05:10] <EcoBlue> How can I add free space to a partition?
[05:10] <nickrud_> TiG4, hm, it's almost time to file a bug then. I'm still reading your sources, a sec
[05:10] <cocox> which is the equivalent for the "service" command in fedora ???
[05:10] <rramos> hi
[05:10] <nickrud_> arnieplanet eh
[05:10] <TiG4> nickrud_, thank you
[05:11] <cocox> !tell EcoBlue about qparted
[05:11] <cocox> !tell EcoBlue about fdisk
[05:11] <nickrud_> TiG4, to be honest, I am not suprised you're having problems upgrading with the extras sources you have.
[05:12] <nickrud_> such as the 00o2, wine, etc repos
[05:12] <wims> !firefox
[05:12] <TiG4> nickrud_, think i should disable the extras and try again
[05:12] <TiG4> nickrud_, ?
[05:12] <wims> !firefox1.5
[05:12] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[05:12] <molinero> !breezy
[05:12] <ubotu> Breezy is the current stable version of Ubuntu. If you would like to upgrade to it, the guide to upgrading to Breezy is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade
[05:13] <nickrud_> TiG4, yes, it's worth a shot. Me, I'd disable those sources, start aptitude and purge any obsolete or local packages.
[05:13] <Ademan> with samba, what type of permission does a file have to have in order for it to be written to?
[05:13] <Ademan> does it work like normal file permissions? because it didnt seem to be
[05:13] <nickrud_> TiG4, it'll force you to loose wine for example, but you can always reinstall
[05:13] <EcoBlue> !fdisk
[05:13] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, EcoBlue
[05:13] <EcoBlue> !qparted
[05:13] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, EcoBlue
[05:14] <cocox> which is the equivalent for the "service" command in fedora ???
[05:14] <Ademan> is wine anywhere near as good as caedega?
[05:14] <Healot> Ademan: cedega is sister project of wine, targeting windows games
[05:14] <bintrue> Ademan depends on what you are using it for
[05:14] <disinterested_pe> ok intalling easyubuntu when i do the cd easyubuntu cmd i get no such file or directory y do i get that?s
[05:14] <nickrud_> TiG4, for sanity's sake, the developers limit their support of upgrades to packages that they release
[05:15] <sam_> cocox: "/etc/init.d/<service_name>"
[05:15] <TiG4> nickrud_, yeah.. i gotcha, should i even disable backports?
[05:15] <nickrud_> TiG4, yes
[05:15] <bintrue> After starting the interactive install, is there a way to see the text going on in the background?
[05:15] <tritium> cocox: sudo invoke-rc.d <service-name> start | stop | restart
[05:15] <EcoBlue> What would I format a partition if I wanted to combine it with another?
[05:15] <TiG4> nickrud_, ok
[05:15] <spikeb> <3 backports
[05:15] <TiG4> nickrud_, lemme try that
[05:15] <cocox> sam_, yes i knew about that way... but im stiill looking fot another one thnx
[05:16] <sam_> cocox: tritium has got it.
[05:16] <TiG4> nickrud_, i think im just going to have to do a clean install
[05:16] <cocox> yes im looking..
[05:16] <nickrud_> TiG4, wise choice, really from where you are
[05:16] <tritium> sam_: your method works as well :)
[05:16] <cocox> sam_, tritium thnx guys ;)
[05:16] <TiG4> nickrud_, thanks for all the help :)
[05:16] <tritium> sam_: with sudo, of course
[05:16] <FatalFury> im having a problem upgrading to dapper drake from breezy badger
[05:17] <EcoBlue> How would I combine partitions without destroying data on one?
[05:17] <Dr_Willis> EcoBlue,  how about the data on both?
[05:17] <FatalFury> when im installing i get this: 'Invalid package information
[05:17] <FatalFury> After your package information was updated the essential package 'ubuntu-base' can not be found anymore.
[05:17] <FatalFury> This indicates a serious error, please report this as a bug."
[05:17] <tritium> FatalFury: #ubuntu+1 for dapper please
[05:17] <nickrud_> TiG4, yw
[05:17] <EcoBlue> Dr_Willis, ok, that works.
[05:17] <FatalFury> kk
[05:17] <ranpha> how can you check speeds for your network??? and where can you check if the card is on 100mbit?
[05:18] <protocol1> whats the command to go to video card setup?
[05:18] <Dr_Willis> EcoBlue,  i ment it as a question. :P you got 1 drive with data partition and 1 empty parttion?
[05:18] <nickrud_> FatalFury, have you just now changed anything in your sources? via synpatic or anything?
[05:18] <ejer> protocol1: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:18] <tritium> protocol1: you mean xserver setup?
[05:18] <protocol1> yeah
[05:18] <FatalFury> i dont think so
[05:18] <EcoBlue> Dr_Willis: One has a corrupt file system, One has Ubuntu.
[05:19] <Dr_Willis> EcoBlue,  you dont care about the data at all on the corrupted one?
[05:19] <FatalFury> i edited the repositories to get community maintained packes a while ago
[05:19] <protocol1> need to see if I can use diiferent settings
[05:19] <EcoBlue> I do if I can save it.
[05:19] <UPL> Hey can someone help me... Is there a way to tell someones IP through this irc?
[05:19] <nickrud_> FatalFury, that's probably it, you disabled the main repo accidentally most likely.
[05:20] <ranpha> can anyone see my message?
[05:20] <nickrud_> UPL, right click their name
[05:20] <bintrue> ranpha nope
[05:20] <EcoBlue> Dr_Willis: I do If I can save it.
[05:21] <Dr_Willis> EcoBlue,  :) time to research file system recovery i guess.
[05:21] <ranpha> bintrue: thnx :-)
[05:21] <h3h_timo> is there an easy way to upgrade from breezy badger to dapper drake without losing all my files?
[05:21] <EcoBlue> Dr_Willis: Where would I do that?
[05:21] <bimberi> ubotu tell h3h_timo about upgrade
[05:21] <Dr_Willis> EcoBlue,  depends on the file system and what happened to it. for a start. fsck is the core 'file system fixer tool'
[05:21] <ranpha> perhaps somebody can tell where you see if your network card is turned on for 100mbit speed?
[05:22] <nickrud_> !upgrade
[05:22] <ubotu> methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[05:22] <h3h_timo> bimberi, thanks
[05:22] <bimberi> h3h_timo: np :)
[05:22] <cocox> sam_, tritium i read the man and if i want to know the status of one service i should do this e.i "sudo invoke-rc.d telnet status" but it is ok?? in this case the output is "unknown initscript, /etc/init.d/telnet not found."
[05:22] <FatalFury> nickrud_, i dont think thats my problem
[05:22] <nickrud_> that's a decent factoid. bimberi did you clean wine :)
[05:22] <EcoBlue> !fsck
[05:22] <ejer> cocox: you do not have telnet installed
[05:23] <nickrud_> FatalFury, I'm wiling to bet a beer. paste your sources on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[05:23] <tritium> cocox: make sure you've installed the services you want
[05:23] <bimberi> nickrud_: yes, thanks :) although the wikipage it points to has some interesting wine repos on it
[05:23] <cocox> ejer, so.. why when i type telnet over the console y get the telnet> poiinter ?
[05:23] <FatalFury> nickrud_, the only repository i changed was Ubuntu 5.10 "Breezy Badger" Binary from universe to multiuniverse
[05:23] <tritium> cocox: that's the client, not a server
[05:23] <EcoBlue> Dr_Willis: It is a "Unkown" file system, used to be linux swap, then fat32.
[05:24] <nickrud_> bimberi, I know little about wine, I need a place to leave people :)
[05:24] <ranpha> nobody knows where network settings like half and full duplex are in ubuntu?
[05:24] <cocox> tritium, so it should no use the 23 port ??
[05:24] <tritium> ranpha: network settings are in /etc/network/interfaces
[05:24] <ejer> cocox: you can connect to others via telnet, they can't connect to you
[05:24] <bimberi> nickrud_: lol kk :)
[05:24] <nickrud_> FatalFury, gedit /etc/apt/sources.list in a terminal; paste the contents on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[05:24] <userseba> hoa
[05:24] <tritium> cocox: telnetd is not intsalled by defualt
[05:25] <FatalFury> k
[05:25] <userseba> alguien de latinoamerica ??
[05:25] <cocox> tritium, ejer ... mmmm and there is a way to know what services are running over my pc... i use "netstat -plant" but i dont know if there is a better or another one
[05:25] <cocox> si hola ;)
[05:26] <tritium> !es
[05:26] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[05:26] <ejer> cocox: sudo apt-get install nmap && nmap localhost
[05:26] <userseba> ok, gracias...
[05:26] <FatalFury> nickrud_, i pasted it
[05:26] <tritium> cocox: most services have initscripts in /etc/init.d
[05:27] <cocox> ejer, tritium ... for example.. i do this "sudo nmap myip" and nmap shows me that ftp,http and telnet are running over my pc and when i do an "netstat -plant" i couldnt find any of those services running
[05:28] <redir> cocox, sudo nmap localhost?
[05:28] <ejer> cocox: what does myip equal?
[05:28] <nickrud_> FatalFury, according to that, you should be able to see ubuntu-base ( deb http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-updates main restricted) , you may need to follow instructions and file a bug
[05:28] <ejer> cocox: localhost
[05:28] <nickrud_> FatalFury, but first, let me ask
[05:29] <nickrud_> are the canadian repos still fubar'd?
[05:29] <cocox> ejer, redir, tritium to my public ip
[05:29] <tritium> cocox: unless you installed ftp and http servers, they are not running on an ubuntu intsall by default
[05:29] <nickrud_> FatalFury, herm I am pasting & cutting an idioting tonight
[05:29] <redir> cocox which is on th emachine you are scanning from?
[05:29] <ejer> cocox: so what is at your public IP? A router?
[05:30] <nickrud_> FatalFury, line 5: uncomment it: remove the #
[05:30] <nickrud_> FatalFury, and that is not right, I absolutely hate the original ubuntu sources.
[05:30] <cocox> tritium, ejer, redir my ip public is the ip that my isp gives me when i get out over the internet :S
[05:31] <FatalFury> k
[05:31] <redir> cocox but is it on your local interface?
[05:31] <userseba> de que paises son ustedes ?
[05:31] <cocox> redir, ejer, tritium any of this services have been installed by me
[05:31] <redir> cocox, s/any/none ?
[05:31] <cocox> redir, how can i know that ? i just make an www.whatismyip.com llol
[05:31] <bimberi> nickrud_: hear hear
[05:31] <cocox> redir, im the only root
[05:31] <redir> cocox, ifconfig -a
[05:31] <ejer> cocox: you must scan localhost to see what services are running
[05:32] <nickrud_> FatalFury, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 <--- replace everything in that file with this. you'll want to re-add the skpye sources after you are done
[05:32] <nickrud_> bimberi, look in /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list, you will be able to work with those in a few days
[05:33] <cocox> ejer, redir and why not my public ip ?
[05:33] <cocox> redir, my eth0 have just my private ip 192.168.1.2
[05:33] <redir> cocox, if you rpublic IP is not on your machine
[05:33] <FatalFury> nickrud_, kk thnx
[05:33] <redir> cocox, you aren't finding which service are running on it
[05:33] <cocox> redir, really ? lol :sadface
[05:34] <nickrud_> FatalFury, usable sources are the core of an ubuntu system, and those are good
[05:34] <bimberi> nickrud_: yay! (although hoary & breezy is still supported :P )
[05:34] <redir> cocox, sudo nmap localhost
[05:34] <redir> cocox, sudo nmap 192.168.1.2
[05:34] <nickrud_> bimberi, bah
[05:34] <bimberi> s/is/are/
[05:34] <redir> your 'Public IP is prolly on a router which is prolly running http and telnet
[05:34] <cocox> redir, when i do nmap to localhost this shows me this
[05:35] <cocox> 25/tcp    open  smtp
[05:35] <cocox> 631/tcp   open  ipp

[05:35] <cocox> 32771/tcp open  sometimes-rpc5
[05:35] <nickrud_> I think I'm gonna copy those to the pastebin, but what do define them as ...
[05:35] <bimberi> nickrud_: we need #ubuntu-1 and #ubuntu-2 :P
[05:35] <cocox> redir, if i do this for 192.168.1.2 just shows me this
[05:35] <cocox> 901/tcp open  samba-swat
[05:35] <tritium> cocox: please don't paste
[05:36] <redir> cocox, pastebin please
[05:36] <cocox> tritium, didnt know its not allowed sorry
[05:36] <tritium> cocox: no problem
[05:36] <cocox> cocox, pastebin ?

[05:37] <cocox> redir, did u read what i pasted ?
[05:37] <nickrud_> I wish someone would host decent sources, so I could simply point wget at the darn thing
[05:38] <Ademan> this is kinda unrelated, but how would i go about installing unreal tournament 2004 on linux?  as of now I can't find a binary for linux (online, is there one on the disk?) and then theres the fact that no doubt the installer is native win32
[05:39] <Ademan> hey look
[05:39] <Ademan> linuxinstaller.sh
[05:39] <Ademan> :-)
[05:39] <nickrud_> Ademan, you running the 64 bit ubuntu then?
[05:39] <Ademan> no
[05:39] <roast> ati chips suck :P
[05:40] <Olde> anyone know the release date for Dapper Drake Final
[05:40] <Ademan> june something
[05:40] <bimberi> nickrud_: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/d6047  (note the "d")
[05:40] <tritium> June 1, Olde
[05:40] <Olde> thanks
[05:40] <nickrud_> now that is interesting, realplayer 10 wanted to open that page, bimberi
[05:41] <TiG4> ---is it possible to take an iso and mount it so that ubuntu thinks its a cd and actually recognizes it as a cd so that I can install an image in VM-Ware forexample?
[05:41] <paradizelost> howdy
[05:41] <paradizelost> TiG4: you can tell vmware that the iso is the cd drive
[05:41] <paradizelost> it's in the vm properties
[05:41] <bimberi> nickrud_: really? - it comes through as post_6047.txt
[05:42] <TiG4> paradizelost, interesting... let me check that out, thanks
[05:42] <nickrud_> bimberi, yeah, I opened it in gedit no problem. Just interesting file association locally
[05:43] <nickrud_> I've been toying witht the media players on restricted, just an interesting point I'm at
[05:43] <TiG4> paradizelost, don't seem to see that
[05:43] <paradizelost> TiG4: are you using vmware player?
[05:43] <TiG4> paradizelost, workstation, but i have both installed
[05:44] <EcoBlue> How do I install tar.gz application things?
[05:44] <ReleaseX> i'm having a problem with X freezing after being on for about 10 minutes, the mouse will work fine, but the rest is complety frozen
[05:44] <paradizelost> TiG4: edit virtual machine settings -> click on cdrom -> mark "use iso image" and browse to where the iso is located
[05:44] <nickrud_> bimberi, yeah that's good :)
[05:45] <bimberi> nickrud_: :)
[05:45] <nickrud_> bimberi, I got txt associations screwed up while I was playing with smil file types
[05:46] <EcoBlue> How do I install files I download off the internet, such as firefox 1.5?
[05:46] <nickrud_> !ff1.5
[05:46] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[05:46] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, did you see the ubotu thing just above?
[05:46] <paradizelost> EcoBlue: are you asking how to install .exe files? or how to install firefox that you downloaded the isntaller
[05:46] <paradizelost> ?
[05:46] <EcoBlue> Yes, but how do I install stuff that is a .tar.gz file?
[05:47] <EcoBlue> Yes to your first question.
[05:47] <paradizelost> EcoBlue: depends, usually you tar -xvzf tarfilename.tar.gz
[05:47] <paradizelost> to extract it
[05:47] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, it really depends on what's inside that .tar.gz , that's why people write wiki's for specific applications
[05:48] <EcoBlue> It has a "Firefox" folder
[05:48] <paradizelost> then in there, there will be a README file
[05:53] <oblib> I seem to have hosed my opengl. It used to work fine, but now if I open a program that uses it, gnome restarts. Any help?

[05:56] <molinero> Pastorius entra a #ubuntu-es
[05:56] <bintrue> thanks :)
[05:56] <bintrue> never did use sudo with debian
[05:56] <bintrue> perhaps I should learn
[05:56] <holycow> hey guys, i need to install icc profile support on ubuntu for scribus.  does anyone know what package/packages that might be?
[05:57] <holycow> !icc
[05:57] <ubotu> Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, holycow
[05:57] <nickrud_> I always used sudo with debian, just passwordless. I still ruffle a bit at putting in a password now and then
[05:58] <oblib> Does anyone know what is necessary for OpenGL to work?
[05:58] <nickrud_> oblib, having glxinfo say you have glx active
[05:58] <nickrud_> oblib, getting there depends on your card
[05:59] <oblib> nvidia
[05:59] <oblib> I seem to have hosed my opengl. It used to work fine, but now if I open a program that uses it, gnome restarts. Any help?
[05:59] <Healot> oblib: a 3D accelerator, 3D X driver+modules, and GL libraries
[05:59] <oblib> Healot, how do I know if I hosed the libraries?
[05:59] <oblib> or driver
[05:59] <oblib> All I can think is that an apt upgrade messed something up
[06:00] <yacuruna> hello helpme never linux
[06:00] <yacuruna> speak spanish
[06:00] <yacuruna> helpmee
[06:00] <bintrue> !es
[06:00] <nickrud_> oblib, you probably upraded your kernel recently, and didn't get the restricted modules along with it (or at least, that's what just happened to me)
[06:00] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[06:01] <oblib> yeah, you're probably right, but usually when that happens X won't load at all. Weird
[06:01] <oblib> I'll have to recompile
[06:01] <oblib> that's what I get for using an old driver
[06:01] <henry_> oooo
[06:01] <nickrud_> oblib, I had a double flicker at X startup, and had an xorg with nv in it
[06:02] <oblib> nickrud_, you had "nv" and "nvidia"?
[06:02] <EcoBlue> ubuntu is too complicated to install stuff.
[06:02] <nickrud_> not bad, having X reconfigure it self
[06:03] <Healot> not really, i would say it is easier than most distros out there
[06:03] <Madpilot> EcoBlue, Applications->Add Applications is complicated?
[06:03] <oblib> thanks, I'm going to try recompiling my driver
[06:03] <nickrud_> oblib, no, I had nvidia. Then I upgraded the kernel. I didn't have linux-686 installed, so I missed the restricted modules update for the new nvidia kernel module
[06:03] <[NP] Tangent> Ubuntu is quite easy
[06:03] <nickrud_> so X reconfigured
[06:03] <[NP] Tangent> installing stuff is cake if you know what to do
[06:03] <oblib> ah
[06:03] <nickrud_> not bad :)
[06:03] <[NP] Tangent> you can edit your apt-get sources and include the universal sources... that made installing bzflag really easy for me
[06:03] <eightball> Ubuntu has shown me Linux has matured quite a bt.
[06:04] <EcoBlue> But harder than windows. To install stuff off the internet.
[06:04] <eightball> bit too...
[06:04] <bintrue> harder than windows?
[06:04] <bintrue> EcoBlue, I wish windows had apt!
[06:04] <eightball> bintrue: me too, dude
[06:04] <[NP] Tangent> it's harder to keep a working computer with windows on it
[06:04] <googler> did you try synaptic or apt-get
[06:04] <nikkiana> bintrue, me too...
[06:05] <EcoBlue> If only ubuntu would have extracting things that autoinstall.
[06:05] <[NP] Tangent> apt-get is nice
[06:05] <bintrue> honestly the only thing windows has going for it is the install
[06:05] <[NP] Tangent> ecoblue, heard of apt-get or Synaptic?
[06:05] <[NP] Tangent> Synaptic > Install
[06:05] <EcoBlue> Yes.
[06:05] <Healot> bintrue: windows application are not free. hard to make a repos out of it :)
[06:05] <faolan> EcoBlue: I like the way Ubuntu installs stuff. if you can't get it with apt (ie, you download it from a website) it really makes you think "do I need to install this"
[06:05] <Malikith> Synaptic does just that eco
[06:05] <eightball> EcoBlue: dpkg -i <packagename>.deb
[06:05] <nikkiana> bintrue, this is true... when i first started using linux, the fact that there was no installers was wicked confusing
[06:05] <eightball> if you get a deb package
[06:05] <bintrue> Healot, ya never said it was practical. but it sure would make life better
[06:06] <bintrue> nikkiana, my first install was a debian floppy network bootstrap :/
[06:06] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, most everything you want to install is already packaged & available in synaptic, you don't need to get stuff off the net.
[06:06] <[NP] Tangent> the first program I installed on linux
[06:06] <[NP] Tangent> I compiled it
[06:06] <[NP] Tangent> UnrealIRCD
[06:06] <Healot> it can be done, but the licensing for most windows app doesn't allow easy redistribution
[06:07] <nikkiana> bintrue, fun stuff ;)
[06:07] <googler> alien -i pkg_name.rpm if you get rpm package
[06:07] <bintrue> nikkiana, yup. it's kinda sad that I can do that but I can
[06:07] <bintrue> 't seem to get my 6.06 working
[06:07] <nickrud_> bintrue, heh. I spent about a year getting to the point I felt comfortable with that :)
[06:07] <faolan> I'm quite satisfied with synaptic too. great choice. rarely do I need to use a stray package
[06:08] <bintrue> after having my file server running debian then ubuntu for years, I'm finally moving into the Linux on Laptop Department
[06:08] <bintrue> where all the fun is
[06:08] <TiG4> --- Is anyone familiar with installing TV Tuner cards, in particular the ASUS PVR-416? ---
[06:08] <nikkiana> bintrue, i'm not brave enough for that yet... LOL.
[06:09] <eightball> lol
[06:09] <nickrud_> it's easy, trust us :)
[06:09] <eightball> i remember TurboLinux 6. ugh
[06:09] <nikkiana> though it would be sweet to have a pink laptop running linux....
=== jack is now known as jack-
[06:09] <varsendagger> hye my asdsl keeps resetting my /etc/resolve.conf   how can i fix this
[06:10] <servando> anyone use pdf-writer before
[06:10] <nickrud_> varsendagger, it should do that.
[06:10] <servando> the demos don't work
[06:11] <nickrud_> varsendagger, do you get bad resovlers, or just not the ones you want?
[06:11] <varsendagger> nickrud_, byt have to change my nameserver
[06:11] <servando>  `require': no such file to load -- pdf/writer (LoadError)
[06:11] <Healot> servando: IF you'd like to do PDF, use OO, it has built-in PDF generator
[06:11] <varsendagger> nickrud_,  yeah i get bad reslovers, ones that will not work
[06:11] <eightball> OOo 2 does. i can't remember if the first version did or not
[06:11] <servando> Healot your right OO works great
[06:12] <servando> but I can't sleep so I thought I'd do some coding
[06:12] <nickrud_> varsendagger, how are you starting your asdl? I know two methods: setting the modem directly via it's web interface, or using pppoeconf
[06:12] <nikkiana> in other randomness, i noticed that some stuff i've looked at that's in flash is missing text.... could that be because i don't have whatever font the paricular flash thingie is using?
[06:12] <faolan> you could always you PostScript. It's almost the same thing
[06:12] <servando> I installed pdf using gem
[06:13] <varsendagger> hmmm i don't really know
[06:13] <sam_> varsendagger: The best way is fix your adsl router/modem/bridge thingy.
[06:13] <nickrud_> nikkiana, http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats, there's some info about fonts in flash there
[06:13] <TiG4> --- Is anyone familiar with installing TV Tuner cards, in particular the ASUS PVR-416? ---

[06:13] <nikkiana> nickrud_, danke
[06:13] <grecko> Hola
[06:13] <fogos> hola
[06:13] <sam_> If you cant, The easiest permanent workaround is to edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[06:13] <grecko> algien habla espaol
[06:14] <fogos> alguien ha instalado php 5

[06:14] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[06:14] <nickrud_> varsendagger, the best way is via a browser pointed at your hopefully intelligent router/modem. Most likey at 168.192.0.1
[06:14] <sam_> prepend domain-name-servers <a good dns servers ip>;
[06:15] <faolan> no speako el spanisho
[06:15] <varsendagger> sam_,  do that in console or where
[06:15] <tritium> fogos: /j #ubuntu-es
[06:15] <nickrud_> erm, well 192.168.0.1 :)
[06:15] <sam_> edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[06:15] <fogos> sorry... someone have installed php 5
[06:15] <sam_> varsendagger: but first try what nickrud is explaining
[06:16] <sam_> You only need to override it if you have a truly braindead router.
[06:16] <sam_> Like those little grey boxes Qwest/MSN gives everyone.
[06:17] <varsendagger> nickrud_,  i wnat to change my nameserver   what should i do
[06:17] <varsendagger> sam_, how did you guess that i have a qwest dsl server
[06:17] <sam_> lol!
[06:17] <sam_> Because you're having the same problem everyone with them has.
[06:17] <torpedo|dog> varsendagger, it's also in your hostmask ;)
[06:17] <nickrud_> varsendagger, I'd seriouly suggest just letting your isp provide your nameservers. I always do, because it's easy.
[06:18] <sam_> nickrud_: That stupid box, points at itself, but doesn't work.
[06:18] <varsendagger> torpedo|dog, i knwe that
[06:18] <sam_> He's getting 192.168.1.1 in his /etc/resolv.conf
[06:18] <nickrud_> sam_, never been on qwest, & I think I'm glad
[06:19] <varsendagger> how about running a script every time i start my computer and every 6 hours
[06:19] <sam_> yeah, me neither but I used to consult in a qwest town.
[06:19] <sam_> varsendagger: just use the prepend line.
[06:19] <nickrud_> varsendagger, your isp will have the proper nameserver ip's somewhere, look for those to start. There are ways to override the isp nameservers
[06:20] <kaco> wenas
[06:20] <nickrud_> varsendagger, on second thought, sam_ has better experience in this than I
[06:20] <torpedo|dog> Is there an easy way to just clean out a POP mailbox using something like fetchmail?
[06:20] <sam_> varsendagger: you can use the qwest nameservers, that's not a problem. You just can't use the router as a name server
[06:21] <varsendagger> what do you mean?
[06:21] <varsendagger> 4.2.2.1 works for me
[06:21] <nikkiana> yay. flash works right now. except for on MySpace. but they're ghetto and suck.
[06:21] <patricio> hola

[06:22] <torpedo|dog> alli pueden ayudarle
[06:22] <sam_> if so we can walk you through it.
[06:22] <patricio> join ubuntu.es
[06:22] <nikkiana> Healot, yeah, i noticed that. boo on that.
[06:22] <patricio> join #ubuntu.es
[06:22] <deshantm> i am trying to get a minimal X working, but it is giving me the error: Xession: unable to start X session --- no ~/.xsession file, no session managers, no window managers, and no terminal emulators found; aborting
[06:22] <varsendagger> sam_, no i got that  i just don't want to mess up my net connection and i always seem to do that
[06:22] <Healot> nikkiana: boo who?
[06:23] <sam_> if not, then edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[06:23] <torpedo|dog> patricio, tecla un "/" antes de "join"
[06:23] <eshowl_> hi everyone, is there any good online game for ubuntu? it does not necessary has to be free
[06:23] <patricio> gracias torpedo

[06:23] <torpedo|dog> nada
[06:23] <sam_> add the line
[06:23] <nikkiana> Healot, boo to the fact that my friends insist on uploading funny movies of themselves on MySpace which requires Flash 8, requiring me to use Windoze. :P
[06:23] <Viper12> what kind of game are you looking for eshowl_?
[06:23] <dertre> i need some help

[06:23] <sam_> prepend domain-name-servers 4.2.2.1;
[06:24] <Healot> nikkiana: what's the purpose of myspace anyways?
[06:24] <varsendagger> nikkiana, get some new friends
[06:24] <dertre> i have instaled  ubunto 5.10
[06:24] <eshowl_> Viper12 maybe some RPG games
[06:24] <faolan> MySpace really sucks
[06:24] <nickrud_> deshantm, that's about as minimal as it gets
[06:24] <deshantm> nickrud, thanks i will try it
[06:24] <dertre> but it never asked me to make root password
[06:24] <dertre> and now i can not login as root
[06:24] <sam_> good lord this channel scrolls fast!
[06:24] <dertre> can some one tell me what is the defauls pass
[06:24] <nikkiana> Healot, to keep track of un-techno friends who don't check their email like any logical sane person does....
[06:24] <dertre> for root ?
[06:24] <nickrud_> deshantm, add xterm to the apt-get install invocation
[06:24] <TiG4> --- If I have a pci (tv tuner) card installed but it is not showing up in 'lspci' what does that mean? I know the card works ---
[06:24] <Viper12> eshowl_:  here is a good place to start looking.  http://www.linux-gamers.net/
[06:25] <eshowl_> oh, do they have online game tho?
[06:25] <deshantm> nickrud, ok can i leave out twn and use fluxbox instead?
[06:25] <Viper12> I personally play eve-online via cedega, but there are some other native stuff going on.  There is even an open source MMO EQ like game going.
[06:26] <varsendagger> sam_, is it possible for me to make a web server with having a qwest dsl modem
[06:26] <nickrud_> deshantm, you could substitute fluxbox for twm
[06:26] <Viper12> eshowl_:  that is a gamer site that discusses lotsa games as well as reviews, and such.
[06:26] <tonyyarusso> !root
[06:26] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[06:26] <eshowl_> Viper12 can you tell me some more detail? what do you suggest me?
[06:26] <eshowl_> Viper12 i see
[06:26] <nickrud_> deshantm, I don't use fluxbox so I don't know exactly what package to install
[06:26] <sam_> varsendagger: sure.
[06:26] <varsendagger> sam_, do you know how to do that?
[06:27] <sam_> That little actiontec, is mostly ok. It's just that you can't turn off the dns mirroring.
[06:27] <varsendagger> deshantm, what are you looking for?
[06:27] <deshantm> nickrud, sweet it works thanks a lot...
[06:28] <deshantm> varsendagger, thanks but i just got it to work
[06:28] <varsendagger> sam_, i had a heck of a time getting a webserver setup   --- in fact i gave up
[06:28] <varsendagger> deshantm, flux is really good
[06:28] <sam_> varsendagger: just forward the ports you need (80 and stuff) to the box your server is on.
[06:28] <Viper12> Also eshowl_ if you open up synaptic and go to the games and amusements section, (especially if you have multiverse/universe enabled), you will see tons of games, some online.  Also a BIG one..... A Tale in the Desert (egypt mmorpg) is in beta now and has a native linux client.
[06:29] <varsendagger> how can i tell it which box to forwad the ports to ( ip address or what?
[06:29] <Viper12> Its not a hack/n/slash style game, but it is free currently in beta testing.  I believe you can go to:  mmorpg.com and get a key for it.
[06:29] <eshowl_> Viper12, wow that's a great information, thank you so much, let me check it out now
[06:30] <varsendagger> sam_, nevermind   i will tackle that later when the fishing isn't a good
[06:30] <sam_> yes, ip address.
[06:30] <Viper12> good luck.........and HAVE FUN!  eshowl. ;)

[06:32] <servando> I can learn so much just by reading this channel I should have gave up on XP a long time ago
[06:32] <AngryElf> guys i'm running an AMD 64 3000+ with uname -r == 2.6.12-10-amd64-k8   that silly little "post-update" notification keeps telling me to reboot because there's a newer kernel installed...the only other one installed is 2.6.12.9.etc... How can i make it go away?
[06:32] <AngryElf> XP is doo doo
[06:33] <tonyyarusso> AngryElf: Besides rebooting?
[06:33] <tonyyarusso> AngryElf: It's probably a new subversion.
[06:33] <AngryElf> i rebooted, twice
[06:33] <servando> a storm fried my pc a few days ago
[06:33] <tonyyarusso> oh
[06:33] <nikkiana> servando, ouch! i'm sorry.
[06:33] <eshowl_> Viper12, i can't find a tale in desert anywhere in my synaptic@@
[06:34] <servando> nikkiana : it was the best thing that could have happened
[06:34] <tonyyarusso> AngryElf: Maybe if you do the dist-upgrade, update-grub dance again it will be happy?
[06:34] <singsung> hey guys, i just installed VNC server/client according to a thread on the forum...when i run the client a window comes up that says X11, but it is gray with the pointer in it. anything i missed?
[06:34] <tonyyarusso> servando: Insurance?
[06:35] <servando> yep
[06:35] <tonyyarusso> servando: Sweet deal.  My church camp got all new canoes that way.
[06:35] <servando> just waiting on the check
[06:36] <Viper12> eshowl_:   ATITD3 (the short name for A tale in the desert) is NOT in the repositories.  You need to go to their website and download the client.  Instructions on how to use it are there.  It is a BETA client.
[06:36] <Viper12> eshowl_:   here:   http://www.atitd.com/
[06:36] <eshowl_> oh great, thanks :D
[06:37] <singsung> i saw other people in the thread were having this issue as well, but i didn't see the issue addressed
[06:38] <CharlesE> I am setting up an ubuntu server on a brand new 40gb hdd the server is for postgres\mysql\php5\apache2\irc\jabber\email and you get the idea, do you guys recommend ltos of partitions for each servers data or just seperate ones for things such as \var\ftp\ or var\www\ or none at all??
[06:39] <eshowl_> Viper12, lol it takes forever to download it... Is there any mutithread download program works on ubuntu?
[06:39] <Viper12> uh........firefox?  download manager?  minimize it and do other stuff? ;)
[06:40] <eshowl_> Viper12, yeah using firefox right now, so there is no things like "flashget"?
[06:41] <Viper12> never needed any of that personally.  download manager does multiple downloads and works for me.
[06:41] <CharlesE> i dont mean to be an asshole but can some of you please give me an answer as to if lots of small partitions is better then one big partition for a server i need the answer as soon as possbile as im in the partition screen in the ubuntu install
[06:41] <AngryElf> synaptic says that i just installed 2.6.12.16  but the files in /boot are all 2.6.10 or lower
[06:41] <eshowl_> Viper12, what do you mean download manager? the one including in firefox?
[06:42] <Viper12> yep.
[06:42] <eshowl_> Viper12, OH? It never do multithread for me XD
[06:42] <Viper12> ?
[06:42] <Noah0504> I just finished installing the RC for 6.06 -- Wow!
[06:42] <Viper12> why do you keep saying multi-thread?
[06:43] <servando> CharlesE: bigger is always better
[06:43] <Viper12> I've had multiple downloads run just fine with that manager.
[06:43] <nickrud_> CharlesE, if you don't know for sure, make a main paritition & a swap
[06:43] <ReleaseX> when i modify my xorg.conf from nv to nvidia, my pc will lock.  I will still be able to use the mouse, but everything else seems lock, I can't even switch consoles
[06:44] <nickrud_> CharlesE, any more is a matter of taste & situation
[06:44] <eshowl_> you know flashget in windows? it cut a file into small pieces and download all the small pieces at a time so i would spend like 1/10 time
[06:44] <Viper12> I don't use winblows eshowl, but cut it apart or not, 280 meg is gonna take awhile regardless.
[06:44] <CharlesE> I am going to go with the default ubuntu partition
[06:44] <CharlesE> thanks
[06:44] <Noah0504> ...but I do have one question.  What happened to the old way of configurating Ubuntu.  It used to be easy to turn off cdparanoia or add a trash icon to the desktop.  I can't seem to find it now.
[06:45] <eshowl_> Viper12, that's true tho, maybe i should go to bed first, thanks for your help tho, good night! :D
[06:45] <Madpilot> Noah0504, you can get gconf-editor & do that stuff, same as always - it just isn't installed by default in Dapper, AFAIK
[06:45] <Viper12> g'nite eshowl_
[06:46] <Some_Person> My NTFS partition won't resize!
[06:46] <Noah0504> Madpilot: Thanks!  I couldn't remember what it was called.  However, is there a way to make those changes without using the editor?
[06:46] <nickrud_> Madpilot, it is
[06:46] <Some_Person> I tried both GParted and Partition Magic.
[06:46] <Madpilot> Noah0504, don't think so.
[06:46] <Madpilot> nickrud_, is it installed, but just removed from the menus?
[06:47] <Noah0504> Madpilot: Well, the I suppose I'll download it, haha.  Thanks.
[06:47] <nickrud_> Madpilot, it's depended upon by ubuntu-desktop. All of the sys tools are turned off in the meu
[06:47] <nickrud_> *menu
[06:48] <Madpilot> Noah0504, before installing it, check the menus w/ Alacarte - right-click on the menu title, select Edit Menus
[06:48] <Viper12> simple fix really to the menu/ gconf stuff.  just "applications > accessories> alacarte.  and turn em on.
[06:48] <Noah0504> Madpilot: Hmm, yeah, it's installed by default.
[06:48] <nickrud_> Madpilot, things move fast underfoot :)
[06:49] <Some_Person> any ideas?
[06:49] <singsung> does anyone know why my vnc server, when connected to, only shows a gray screen  with the mouse cursor?

[06:51] <Some_Person> no
[06:51] <Some_Person> I'm trying to avoid huge downloads
[06:51] <singsung> yes ironblade, i'm on it now, sorry i don't know how to private message you
[06:51] <Some_Person> I have dialup
[06:52] <Jimbob> is anyone using 7600 gt and experiencing x server errors?
[06:52] <ReleaseX> when i modify my xorg.conf from nv to nvidia, my pc will lock.  after about 10 minutes of working fine it will lock up.  I will still be able to use the mouse, but everything else seems lock, I can't even switch consoles, anyone familiar with this problem?
[06:52] <Viper12> bummer for you Some_Person.  lol.  I'm not sure why you would be having problem shrinking ntfs partition unless there is something fubar'd with the partition itself.
[06:52] <Some_Person> Use the VESA driver, singsung
[06:52] <molinero> !xorg
[06:52] <ubotu> well, xorg is To reconfigure your X server, type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" in a terminal, or check here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto or here http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-83973.html

[06:54] <Some_Person> anyone else have ntfs shrink problems?
[06:55] <ReleaseX> nickrud_, yes
[06:55] <IronBlade> singsung: I dunno.. I haven't set up vnc server on linux for ages. I vaguely remember having to set up a startx to get it to actually start a window manager..
[06:55] <Madpilot> penguin-1, #ubuntu+1 for Dapper questions, please
[06:55] <Some_Person> For my nVidia card the VESA driver is the only one that works.

[06:56] <nf4> If I install kubuntu will it ask me if I want to load kde or gnome
[06:56] <nf4> using apt get i mean
[06:57] <nickrud_> ReleaseX, your issue is past me then.
[06:57] <Some_Person> http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/bootitng.html - any good?
[06:57] <nickrud_> ReleaseX, you could file a bug. The better you describe it the sooner you might get a response
[06:57] <ReleaseX> nickrud_, ok thanks
[06:58] <Madpilot> nf4, if you install Kubuntu, you'll get KDE. Ubuntu gets Gnome. You can switch desktops after install very easily, though.
[06:58] <spikeb> no, google released picasa for windows for linux using wine
[06:58] <nickrud_> ReleaseX, helping people get their drivers installed, not troubleshooting the drivers: that's here :)
[06:59] <Madpilot> spikeb, so it's not actually a Linux-native app?
[06:59] <spikeb> Madpilot: nope
[06:59] <Madpilot> bleh
[06:59] <spikeb> Madpilot: it's picasa, wine, and gecko, in a nice package.
[06:59] <Madpilot> interesting...
[06:59] <spikeb> and there is an ubuntu package :)
[07:00] <nf4> thanks
[07:00] <Noah0504> I loved using Picasa on Windows, but I don't know if I should try it out.  I'm pretty happy with F-Spot and auto-correction is suppose to be the next feature in it.

[07:01] <nickrud_> kameron, non-existent

[07:03] <spikeb> if you already have wine, picasa for windows already runs just fine

[07:03] <spikeb> so they're not using any special wine or anything
[07:05] <spikeb> hmm, interesting, though
[07:05] <Bilford> are they making Wine more compatible all the time?
[07:05] <nickrud_> kameron, it's not native to ubuntu yet afaict , but you're asking someone who probably knows how :)
[07:06] <spikeb> it's not JUST the windows version of picasa with wine though, they added desktop integration and hal support
[07:06] <Bilford> Dell is going to start putting Google software on their computers

[07:22] <mbb> anyone running a torrent for release candidate desktop i386? Here it says "tracker status: requested download is not authorized for use with this tracker" - is running, but way slow. RC-alternate-i386 on same client is OK...
[07:22] <Bilford> Kubuntu isnt Ubuntu+KDE
[07:23] <Bilford> It's Ubuntu - GNOME + KDE

[07:25] <molinero> !gnubuntu
[07:25] <ubotu> Huh? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, molinero
[07:25] <EcoBlue> How do I run .deb files?
[07:25] <molinero> !dpkg
[07:25] <ubotu> To install DEB packages, run      sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
[07:26] <EcoBlue> It doesn't do anything.
[07:26] <wims> EcoBlue,  it installs the package, deb files are packages, not program files
[07:26] <EcoBlue> Then what do I do to get it to run?
[07:27] <wims> you can't run a .deb file
[07:27] <EcoBlue> The package.
[07:27] <EcoBlue> How do I install it?
[07:28] <wims> sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
[07:28] <Madpilot> EcoBlue, what are  you trying to install?
[07:28] <EcoBlue> Wine
[07:28] <EcoBlue> And w32 codecs
[07:29] <Madpilot> Wine is in Ubuntu's repos, but I gather it's not the latest version
[07:29] <molinero> ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/pool/main/w/w32codecs/w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb
[07:29] <wims> it is ?
[07:29] <EcoBlue> I have version 0.9.12
[07:29] <variable_office> is there a way to store filesystem quotas in sql?
[07:29] <EcoBlue> Of wine
[07:29] <Bilford> .14 is the latest
[07:29] <wims> i had to add a new repository when i installed it earlier today
[07:29] <wims> or night rather
[07:29] <EcoBlue> Which repository?
[07:30] <wims> deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt breezy main
[07:31] <KeithWeisshar> why are the USA repositories not working
[07:31] <KeithWeisshar> i live in the usa
[07:31] <twysted> yea what the crap is wrong with them
[07:31] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, they have been flakey often :)
[07:32] <KeithWeisshar> i live in the usa
[07:32] <Bilford> why do I have  Wine 0.9.9 , when the latest is 0.9.14
[07:32] <KeithWeisshar> i only use the repositories in the same country i live in
[07:32] <tritium> KeithWeisshar: yes, in Newark, NJ
[07:32] <twysted> KeithWeisshar> you can use other repos it all the same
[07:32] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, ?
[07:33] <KeithWeisshar> how can you tell i'm from newark nj
[07:33] <Madpilot> KeithWeisshar, use the main repos - just remove the us. from your sources
[07:33] <wims> Bilford, 14>9
[07:33] <twysted> KeithWeisshar is i=KeithWei@pool-71-250-38-172.nwrknj.east.verizon.net * Keith Weisshar
[07:33] <Bilford> wims, I know.  Why isnt it updating
[07:33] <EcoBlue> wims, when I add the wine repositor, it cannot find a file, then doesn't connect to that repo.
[07:33] <wims> oh, good point
[07:33] <wims> EcoBlue,  did you update ?
[07:33] <KeithWeisshar> i actually live in hazlet, nj but my dns is in newark nj.  That's where the isp routes to
[07:33] <EcoBlue> To?
[07:34] <EcoBlue> Update ubuntu?
[07:34] <wims> sudo apt-get update
[07:34] <Bilford> How do I upgrade Wine
[07:34] <twysted> damnit X keeps locking up my whole system
[07:34] <twysted> wait it isnt?!
[07:34] <twysted> =p
[07:34] <KeithWeisshar> i have ordered the ubuntu 6.06 cd through shipit
[07:34] <Bilford> no, Frank, it isnt
[07:34] <KeithWeisshar> it has been approved and sent to the shipping company on 5/24j
[07:35] <EcoBlue> wims, that code didn't do anything
[07:35] <wims> try to get wine now
[07:35] <EcoBlue> ok
[07:35] <wims> after the update
[07:35] <Bilford> How do I upgrade Wine
[07:35] <EcoBlue> Here is the error I get:
[07:35] <EcoBlue> W: Couldn't stat source package list http://wine.budgetdedicated.com breezy/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/wine.budgetdedicated.com_apt_dists_breezy_main_binary-amd64_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
[07:36] <wims> oh yeah
[07:36] <wims> it wont work with amd 64
[07:36] <EcoBlue> That's dumb.
[07:36] <KeithWeisshar> is the order on hold until ubuntu 6.06 is released
[07:36] <wims> part of the reason why i formated and installed 32 bit today
[07:36] <EcoBlue> Cause I can't run windows.
[07:36] <Bilford> Why isnt Ubuntu giving me the latest version of Wine
[07:36] <Bilford> is somethign wrong
[07:36] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, microsoft doesn't have a reliable 64 bit version afaict, why should wine?
[07:36] <KeithWeisshar> when i log into the shipit account i get a message your cd's have been approved and sent to the shipping company
[07:37] <KeithWeisshar> does it mean that the cd will be shipped soon
[07:37] <KeithWeisshar> is the order on hold until the final version is released
[07:37] <twysted> KeithWeisshar> listen and stop being a retard, theyll ship when the final version is release
[07:37] <tritium> Bilford: nothing is wrong.  .14 is not packaged up
[07:37] <Jimbob> weird
[07:37] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, you ordered breezy?
[07:37] <tritium> twysted: be nice
[07:37] <Bilford> tritium, ok ty
[07:37] <Jimbob> how come i can only see one harddrive when i try to install ubuntu?
[07:37] <KeithWeisshar> no dappler
[07:37] <EcoBlue> nickrud,_, just saying that my version of windows, which I had all set up, just corrupted after installing Ubuntu.
[07:37] <twysted> i am being nice =) i could have said worse
[07:37] <KeithWeisshar> i pre-ordered dappler
[07:37] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, then you're probably one of the first to recieve when shipped
[07:37] <Jimbob> i think the HD on my SATA is somehow invisible?
[07:37] <wims> EcoBlue,  corrupted?
[07:38] <wims> how?
[07:38] <tritium> twysted: please try harder, then.  Don't all others names here
[07:38] <Jimbob> so does ubuntu work with SATA?
[07:38] <EcoBlue> wims: it just says file type unknown, and when I try to run windows, it just has a blinking line and does nothing.
[07:38] <tritium> yes, Jimbob
[07:38] <egad> who was the fella who was trying to help me install my broadcom wifi drivers last night?
[07:39] <Bilford> 
[07:39] <KeithWeisshar> does it take 6 weeks to deliver to the usa
[07:39] <ricperry1> does ubuntu use the latest stable kernel?  mine is supposedly up to date but I only have choice of 2.6.12 in GRUB.
[07:39] <Jimbob> so if i have a harddrive on sata and the other one on pata, i should able to see both?
[07:39] <LiamCrevan> hi
[07:39] <spikeb> ricperry1: of course not.
[07:39] <tritium> KeithWeisshar: it takes a long time, yes.  Why not download the RC?
[07:39] <disinterested_pe> kieth i got mine in like 4 weeks
[07:39] <twysted> ricperry1> there is no way to keep up to date with all kernel releases BUT you have a stable and secure kernel
[07:40] <nickrud_> ricperry1, that's the latest version in breezy, with security & bug fixes backported from more recent releases
[07:40] <LiamCrevan> can anyone tell me how I can set up LVM partition with the Dapper RC?
[07:40] <spikeb> !dapper
[07:40] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[07:40] <egad> anyways.. whoever was trying to help me yesterday.. just wanted to say I got the broadcom wifi loaded finally..
[07:40] <LiamCrevan> oh
[07:40] <KeithWeisshar> do you recommend the 64-bit version if i have a pentium d with em64 technology
=== nalioth_zZz is now known as nalioth
[07:41] <Bilford> egad, Sakka
[07:41] <EcoBlue> wims, my entire file set up now has a "unknown" file system, I hope I can recover the data.
[07:41] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, no, I recommend the i386 distro
[07:41] <Jimbob> just to make sure, i would need the 64bit version if i got a athlon 64 right?
[07:41] <spikeb> Jimbob: you dont NEED it, no
[07:41] <egad> bilford: nahh their name began with an A hehe
[07:41] <spikeb> Jimbob: but you CAN use it
[07:41] <nickrud_> Jimbob, not need no
[07:41] <Jimbob> ah, i see
[07:41] <wims> EcoBlue,  does it boot at all ?
[07:41] <KeithWeisshar> do you recommend the i386 version for compatibility reasons
[07:41] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: i do
[07:42] <KeithWeisshar> even with a penitum d
[07:42] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: yeah
[07:42] <nickrud_> Jimbob, if you want to play most internet media, go i386
[07:42] <EcoBlue> wims, windows? Nope. Blinking line, nothing.
[07:42] <Madpilot> KeithWeisshar, more of the non-free stuff works w/ 32bit - Flash, Java, etc
[07:42] <Jimbob> oh? why's that?
[07:42] <wims> EcoBlue,  have you tried to mount the partition in ubuntu and extract the important data you need?
[07:42] <nickrud_> Jimbob, because the owners of the software haven't released 64bit stuff.
[07:43] <molinero> !AMD64
[07:43] <ubotu> molinero: Do they come in packets of five. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[07:43] <nickrud_> Jimbob, flash, etc
[07:43] <EcoBlue> wims : With what program?
[07:43] <molinero> !64
[07:43] <ubotu> Do they come in packets of five. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, molinero
[07:43] <wims> sudo mount
[07:43] <Jimbob> oh
[07:43] <EcoBlue> wims : I would use this how? it is the second partition.
[07:44] <KeithWeisshar> i have selected 1 pc, 1 64-bit pc, and 1 mac option from shipit just in case
[07:44] <ricperry1> okay, probably a stupid n00b question, but when i installed ubuntu, i was never prompted to enter a root password.  it only prompted me to set up one user account.
[07:44] <ricperry1> and now when i "su -" it doesn't accept my user password.  what am i doing wrong?
[07:44] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: cool
[07:44] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: that's a good idea :)
[07:44] <RancidLM> hey all how do i get my kernel source? i want to install the nvidia drivers for my kernel but i only got the kernel patch's ?
[07:44] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, you can copy for just about anyone then :)
[07:44] <twysted> ricperry1> use sudo
[07:44] <KeithWeisshar> it takes 6 weeks
[07:45] <spikeb> it the meantime, you can download the RC if you want
[07:45] <KeithWeisshar> it will take 4 to 6 weeks
[07:45] <KeithWeisshar> i'm downloading the rc but that's not final
[07:45] <wims> EcoBlue, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountNtfsOnBoot?highlight=%28ntfs%29
[07:45] <KeithWeisshar> i'm using a cd-rw, not a cd-r since it's not final
[07:45] <spikeb> k
[07:46] <g0dchild> is there anything i should be aware of when builing a kernel from 'linux-version' packages?
[07:46] <KeithWeisshar> i only use cd-r media for final isos, not beta or rc
[07:46] <g0dchild> instead of say 'kernel-version' pkgs?
[07:46] <cyphase> hmm, Google's released Picasa for linux
[07:46] <wims> EcoBlue,  if it mounts it in Ubuntu i'm pretty sure you could install the normal windows MBR, then reinstall grub to make dual boot work
[07:46] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: that's a good idea.
[07:46] <EcoBlue> wims : Thanks, I will see if this works.
[07:47] <RancidLM> ..any one know how to get my kernel source ?
[07:47] <KeithWeisshar> i tried using bittorrent to download the rc but it's not working, no peers
[07:47] <nickrud_> g0dchild, linux-source-2.6.12 is the source for breezy
[07:47] <KeithWeisshar> when i try to use bittorrent it doesn't work due to no peers
[07:48] <spikeb> i keep getting rejected by the tracker
[07:48] <EcoBlue> I figured out why I couldn't get the dpkg command to work: I didn't use terminal. :)
[07:48] <nickrud_> EcoBlue, heh.
[07:49] <wims> EcoBlue,  what did you use then ?
[07:49] <Madpilot> KeithWeisshar, the Ubuntu Dapper RC? There must be something wrong with your BT app, there should be lots of peers for it...
[07:49] <spikeb> Madpilot: i keep getting rejected by the tracker :(
[07:50] <KeithWeisshar> i get a message rejected by tracker too
[07:50] <wims> !ratpoison
[07:50] <ubotu> wims: I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[07:51] <KeithWeisshar> when i try to use bittorrent i keep getting rejected by tracker
[07:51] <Noah0504> KeithWeisshar, Is it a private tracker?
[07:51] <Madpilot> odd. I'm not torrenting this RC, but I haven't had any trouble getting the earlier Dapper torrents here.
[07:52] <KeithWeisshar> no
[07:52] <Papageno> What is a good packet sniffer?
[07:52] <feetboy16> hi. i want to install multiple graphics cards. how do i do this? thanks.
[07:52] <Noah0504> KeithWeisshar, Or are you talking about the Dapper RC?
[07:52] <KeithWeisshar> i'm using the tracker from release.ubuntu.com
[07:52] <twysted> feetboy16> plug them into your computer
[07:52] <KeithWeisshar> yes
[07:52] <RancidLM> where is my kernel source located?
[07:52] <freegagamel> My ubunto5.10 Desktop show error when it shutdown, Error occured at line 236 in /lib/lsb/init-function line 236. How do I fix?
[07:52] <feetboy16> theyre plugged in already
[07:53] <Noah0504> KeithWeisshar, Yeah.  I had touble earlier as well.  I just downloaded via FTP, and then seeded via DHT on BitTorrent.
[07:53] <nickrud_> what's the rc-alternate?
[07:53] <KeithWeisshar> should i only download the desktop iso
[07:53] <lhb> rancidlm: if installed /usr/src
[07:54] <spikeb> nickrud_: reading the release page would tell you\
[07:54] <KeithWeisshar> should i download the final iso due to the long wait time for the shipt cd
[07:54] <Madpilot> KeithWeisshar, that's the LiveCD w/ install ISO - you only need the Install ISO if all you want to do is install it
[07:54] <nickrud_> hm, dragging the torrent to the desktop then doublclicking it always worked before
[07:54] <nickrud_> spikeb, I cruised past that, my bad :)
[07:54] <lhb> rancidlm: otherwise where you downloaded and extracted it, which you then should move to /usr/src
[07:54] <spikeb> hehe nickrud_ :)
[07:54] <EcoBlue> wims : How would I mount a Fat32 file system
[07:55] <RancidLM> lhb: i see it as a tar.bz2
[07:55] <spikeb> nickrud_: it's just the text mode install cd
[07:55] <nickrud_> spikeb, ah, thanks :)
[07:55] <KeithWeisshar> why has the iso name been renamed to desktop for the live/install iso and alternative for the text mode install cd
[07:55] <curious_ronin> hello where would i go if i have an xchat question
[07:56] <KeithWeisshar> does shipit only ship the live/install iso
[07:56] <crimsun> wow, a hinton-james/morrison/newfangled_dorm resident.
[07:56] <achandra> egad: get that wireless deal working?
[07:56] <nickrud_> curious_ronin, a lot of us here use xchat
[07:56] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: yeah
[07:56] <egad> achandra, yep
[07:56] <achandra> sweet
[07:56] <achandra> what was the diff?
[07:56] <KeithWeisshar> will there be a dvd version of ubuntu
[07:56] <eshowl> hey guys, i am installing TransGaming Cedega right now and i failed the OpenGL test, what should i do?
[07:56] <lhb> RancidLM: mv it to /usr/src and unpack it there
[07:56] <achandra> egad: what did you do different?
[07:57] <KeithWeisshar> will there be a dvd iso when the final version is released
[07:57] <egad> achandra, well i have it listed now.. but im not in a wifi location so i cant test it hehe..  installed the latest version of ndiswrapper and installed new header files.. among other things..
[07:57] <tritium> lhb: /usr/local/src would be preferable
[07:57] <curious_ronin> nickrud i can't log onto a certain server
[07:57] <curious_ronin> but i know it is running
[07:57] <fogos> hi.... how i can know the installed gtk+ version
[07:57] <egad> achandra, that is ndiswrapper from sourceforge
[07:58] <egad> achandra, the one in the synaptic thingy didnt seem to work
[07:58] <crimsun> fogos: apt-cache policy libgtk2.0-0 |grep Installed
[07:58] <achandra> egad: nice...the source one was good to go... from source forge right?
[07:58] <Mysta> what is the difference between a server install and a regular install?
[07:58] <wims> server install is very thin?
[07:59] <achandra> egad: im playing with dapper version now and ill post results in a few.
[07:59] <Mysta> wims: im wondering what is not installed or what is added and what not
[07:59] <wims> oh
[07:59] <eshowl> does anyone has any idea about openGL on ubuntu?
[07:59] <Taru> Can anyone please guide me into making  a partition for windows xp home?
[07:59] <nickrud_> curious_ronin, are you sure you're using the right port? is is protected?
[07:59] <achandra> egad: glad to hear you worked it out...even if it was a 5AM in morn...
[07:59] <egad> achandra, yep from sourceforge.. i just followed this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25683&highlight=broadcom but downloaded the ndis from sourceforge and did a make on it
[07:59] <eshowl> Taru, how many partition you want?
[07:59] <EcoBlue> wims, how would I mount a Fat32 system partition
[07:59] <egad> achandra, lol yeah thanks for all the help
[07:59] <achandra> egad: NICE!
[08:00] <RancidLM> lhb: Thnx!
[08:00] <Taru> eshowl, Just Windows, Linux being my main.
[08:00] <wims> EcoBlue,  you could do it manually like this : sudo mount -tvfat /dev/hda1 /mnt
[08:00] <Taru> eshowl, Enough to play FFXI on windows mainly.
[08:00] <lhb> RancidLM: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelHowto
[08:00] <achandra> egad: that whole NDIS business is a pain in the ass..no two distros deal with it the same..
[08:00] <curious_ronin> nickrud: i read about it online and it says other people have the same problem, i can get on it with mirc (when i had a windows machine)
[08:00] <wims> change hda1 to the correct hd / partition
[08:00] <curious_ronin> i will try a different port
[08:00] <curious_ronin> but i am sure it isn't protected
=== irena is now known as igcek
[08:01] <egad> achandra, i wouldnt know.. im a linux newbie hehe.. btw the link to the ndis i used is http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482&package_id=99148&release_id=415148
[08:01] <nickrud_> curious_ronin, you should be able to configure a server item with the same info as mirc
[08:01] <tb77> got a question about pygst...pygst is in the python-gst0.10 package on Dapper but there is no pygst in the python-gst package on Breezy? Is pygst dependent on gstreamer-0.10?
[08:01] <wims> EcoBlue, that would mount it to /mnt, but the owner would be root meaning you have to sudo -s to be able to write and possibly read from it
[08:02] <curious_ronin> nickrud it says uknown host
[08:02] <KeithWeisshar> can i download additional software while running from the live cd
[08:02] <EcoBlue> sudo apt-get install ia32-libs ia32-libs-gtk linux32
[08:02] <EcoBlue> Whoops.
[08:02] <spikeb> grr
[08:03] <spikeb> sudo apt-get remove --purge EcoBlue
=== RemoteVi1wer is now known as RemoteViewer
[08:03] <Taru> eshowl, So, how should I go about doing this partition?
[08:03] <EcoBlue> spikeb, what does that do?
[08:03] <nickrud_> curious_ronin, in a terminal, does ping <host> return a series of lines? (hit ctl-c to stop the lines)
[08:03] <spikeb> EcoBlue: removes you and purges your config files
[08:03] <spikeb> EcoBlue: ;)
[08:03] <EcoBlue> Which removes my files?
[08:03] <wims> EcoBlue, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountingWindowsPartitions?highlight=%28partition%29%7C%28window%29
[08:03] <welp> i've been following the guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto to install xgl on dapper, but when i try to start it, i get: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/738732  anyone know what the problem is?
[08:04] <EcoBlue> That doesn't make sense
[08:04] <spikeb> it's not an actual command. nevermind.
[08:04] <endless_us> to wich script I can ad this line of code to make it load at a boot Code: ( cd /usr/local/irtrans && ./irserver -loglevel 4 /dev/ttyUSB0 ) &  THANKS

[08:05] <nickrud_> distanceisdeath, they repeat themselves, the longer the better. a few hours, anyway
[08:05] <distanceisdeath> its been four
[08:05] <nickrud_> curious_ronin, possilbe
[08:05] <mbb> KeithWeisshar: which iso gave you the bittorrent problem?
[08:05] <nickrud_> distanceisdeath, and no errors?
[08:05] <egad> Has anyone tried the font patches discussed in the ubuntu forums in breezy?
[08:05] <distanceisdeath> nah
[08:05] <curious_ronin> nickrud thanks
[08:05] <welp> distanceisdeath, on my rack servers, they were still going the morning after i started them ;)
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> hmm
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> takes a while
[08:06] <welp> distanceisdeath, you may as well kill them if there's no errors
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> anyway is four hours enough?
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> okay
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> do i press reboot?
[08:06] <nickrud_> yup
[08:06] <distanceisdeath> okay
=== benplaut is now known as benplaut|afk
[08:06] <welp> bleh, anyone here got xgl working on dapper yet?
[08:07] <nickrud_> I'm lazy, I'll wait for edgy for xgl
[08:07] <distanceisdeath> woahhhh
[08:07] <eshowl> welp, i have the question too
[08:07] <distanceisdeath> i got a problem
[08:07] <welp> eshowl, what question?
[08:07] <EcoBlue> wims, It still won't mount.
[08:07] <welp> distanceisdeath, what's up?
[08:07] <eshowl> welp, saw the demo video and can't wait anymore
[08:07] <distanceisdeath> okay
[08:08] <wims> EcoBlue,  try to follow the this howto -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountingWindowsPartitions
[08:08] <welp> eshowl, i've installed it - it just ain't working ;)
[08:08] <wims> if it wont mount after following that then i guess it's damaged
[08:08] <nickrud_> !xgl
[08:08] <ubotu> XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/
[08:08] <EcoBlue> wims, I tried, and it did not mount, ame error as before.
[08:08] <eshowl> welp, too bad, i saw some tutorial online but it seems so complicated
[08:08] <distanceisdeath> i did the memcheck because this kid told me to, because i was having problems installing.....you see what happens is when it boots up the disc...i press enter for the full installation....and after a few seconds it restarts my computer
[08:08] <distanceisdeath> its not my disc or iso
[08:08] <nickrud_> the wiki worked for me, but it needs more for real life
[08:08] <wims> EcoBlue,  then i guess it's damanged :/
[08:08] <EcoBlue> :(
[08:08] <distanceisdeath> because crux 2.2 did the same
[08:09] <welp> nickrud_, are you in #ubuntu-xgl?
[08:09] <EcoBlue> I lost the past 3 months of my life.
[08:09] <eshowl> does anyone know how to get openGL working on ubuntu??
[08:09] <nickrud_> welp, not for at least a couple of months
[08:09] <welp> nickrud_, i'm gonna ask in there for help - i've followed the wiki, but it still ain't working
[08:10] <rajeev> crimsun, u r free now
[08:10] <babo> arrghhh... I'm such a clutz ... can anyone give me the release site for dapper again pls ... ? ... sorry
[08:10] <spikeb> !rc
[08:10] <ubotu> The release candidate for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. For more info on how to get the release candidate see http://releases.ubuntu.com/dapper/
[08:10] <distanceisdeath> isnt dapper the beta?
[08:10] <eshowl> haha the robot knows the answer
[08:10] <nickrud_> welp most likeley place ;)
[08:10] <welp> babo, you can do dist-upgrade too
[08:10] <babo> distanceisdeath, yes but it's nearly finished ...
[08:10] <distanceisdeath> oh
[08:10] <distanceisdeath> is it gonna be awesome?
[08:10] <spikeb> yes
[08:10] <welp> babo, replace all instances of breezy with dapper
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> sweet
[08:11] <welp> distanceisdeath, it IS awesome! :P
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> well can you help?
[08:11] <welp> babo,  in the sources.list
[08:11] <nickrud_> welp, gksudo update-manager -d , that does it all
[08:11] <welp> distanceisdeath, help you what? ;)
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> haha
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> i explained it
[08:11] <[itrebal_sleep] > what packages do i need to play mpg files? i can play them, they just don't do any audio..
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> look up
[08:11] <Papageno> What is a good packet sniffer?
[08:11] <babo> welp: yes, but I'm really tired of having a 64bit working desktop ...
[08:11] <nickrud_> Papageno, ethereal
[08:11] <babo> Papageno, ethereal
[08:11] <Papageno> Thank you
[08:11] <babo> cool ...
[08:11] <distanceisdeath> i did the memcheck because this kid told me to, because i was having problems installing.....you see what happens is when it boots up the disc...i press enter for the full installation....and after a few seconds it restarts my computer
[08:12] <babo> nickrud_: snap
[08:12] <welp> babo, i'm on 64bit too! ;)
[08:12] <nickrud_> I've probably just been typing longer :)
[08:12] <wims> it's a bit disappointing that so many things don't work in 64 bits os
[08:12] <babo> welp: only just ... ;-)
[08:12] <welp> nickrud_, fyi, the error message i'm getting is: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/738732
[08:13] <welp> nickrud_, any ideas at all?
[08:13] <nickrud_> welp, have you set your .xinitrc correctly?
[08:13] <Papageno> nickrud_, babo: What is ethereal's package name? I can't find it in apt.
[08:13] <welp> nickrud_, afaik, yeah, i'll pastebin it
[08:14] <EcoBlue> wims, all hope is lost. I can't even update firefox.
[08:14] <nickrud_> Papageno, ethereal, it's in universe, you need to enable the repo. See below
[08:14] <nickrud_> !repos
[08:14] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[08:14] <Papageno> nickrud_: I have already enabled it.
[08:14] <welp> nickrud_, i don't have an .xinitrc.. :/
[08:14] <achandra> Hello. Hope someone can help with getting the bcm43xx-fwcutter package. I do an apt-get install for it and it comes up with nothing.
[08:15] <welp> Papageno, apt-cahce search ethereal
[08:15] <distanceisdeath> you guys are amazing at this
[08:15] <welp> nickrud_, any chance i can steal your .xinitrc? ;)
[08:15] <nickrud_> Papageno, if your repos are correct: when you type apt-cache policy ethereal, one of the lines will have Candidate: 0.99.0-1ubuntu1
[08:15] <welp> distanceisdeath, why do you say that? ;)
[08:15] <babo> how can i get dapper by ftp ... I seem to have a gnome thing where my last download of dapper gets saved as an iso file, but doesn't use the iso symbol, nor does it have a right-click 'write to disc' option. Whereas the breezy badger does iso on the desktop does. I'm wondering if perhaps there was a problem with the download and it didn't finish or something ...
[08:15] <distanceisdeath> i dont know anything about linuk
[08:15] <distanceisdeath> linux*
[08:15] <distanceisdeath> im all windows
[08:16] <nickrud_> welp, I wiped my xgl about an hour after starting it, it was not ready for prime time. I work on this machine
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> and i wanna learn linuk
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> it looks hard
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> linux**
[08:16] <babo> sorry, that didn't really make sense did it ...
[08:16] <welp> distanceisdeath, it's easy.. when you get used to it
[08:16] <achandra> its only difficult if love to point and click like crazy...
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> i cant even install it...haha
[08:17] <achandra> distanceisdeath: what is breaking during the install?
[08:17] <welp> babo, you don't need the CD to install it
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> the install is restarting my computer
[08:17] <nickrud_> welp, and the instructions have changed radically since I read them, a sec
[08:17] <welp> nickrud_, ok
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> you know how it says "ubuntu...press enter to continue"...well i press enter and restarts my computer
[08:17] <achandra> distanceisdeath: which version..dapper or?
[08:17] <gordonjcp> distanceisdeath: bad burn?
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> 5.10
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> no
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> not a bad burn
[08:18] <welp> gord, no, it happens on another CD
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> i tried it with crux 2.2
[08:18] <welp> erm..
[08:18] <[itrebal_sleep] > how can i add MPEG support? i can playback the video but not the audio portion
[08:18] <[itrebal_sleep] > (to xine)
[08:18] <welp> * gordonjcp
[08:18] <gord> :P
[08:18] <achandra> distanceisdeath: you must have obviosuly checked the MD5 SUM to make sure..so anyhow I had a similar issue..with a laptop
[08:18] <whyami> distanceisdeath, I think you can type "help" when it tells you to press enter. There might be an option for a less agressive install. Did you try the live CD?
[08:18] <achandra> distanceisdeath: I resolved by using dapper.
[08:18] <welp> gord, blooy tab completion ^_-
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> ummm
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> im not sure if i have live cd
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> lemme show you what i downloaded...
[08:19] <achandra> k
[08:19] <babo> welp: I don't need the cd to install it ?
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> install cd
[08:19] <nickrud_> welp, I did the 'nvidia & other cards" section (equivalently) and then jumped down to "other way, console way".
[08:19] <welp> nickrud_, i did it using the other methon
[08:19] <nickrud_> welp, very much a testing type of a run
[08:19] <welp> *method
[08:20] <gordonjcp> distanceisdeath: what's the .iso called?
[08:20] <whyami> distanceisdeath: actually giving dapper a shot isn't a bad idea...
[08:20] <achandra> distanceisdeath: i dl'd this for amd-64 - dapper-install-amd64.iso
[08:20] <distanceisdeath> ubuntu-5.10-install-i386
[08:20] <g0dchild> Hi, what do i need to install if the configure log says "X... configure: error: Can't find X includes. Please check your ins"
[08:20] <achandra> distanceisdeath: like i said..might want to give dapper a try..it resolved a lot of oddoties.
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> i cant do that
[08:21] <gordonjcp> distanceisdeath: does that make sense for the machine you're running it on?
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> i havent any more blank cds
[08:21] <g0dchild> anyone?
[08:21] <tb77> [itrebal_sleep] : does other sound work? or just not in mpeg's
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> yes
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> machine is very capable
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> enough memory
[08:21] <welp> nickrud_, i gotta pack up - taking my desktop to my cousin's house, thanks for any help
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> ohhh
[08:21] <achandra> any stamps?...theyll send you one..lol
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> im running on one hard drive
[08:21] <welp> distanceisdeath, i'm outta here! see you later ;)
[08:21] <whyami> distanceisdeath: what machine is it?
[08:21] <nickrud_> welp, xgl is just pie in the sky, maybe later
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> peace
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> ummm
[08:21] <distanceisdeath> compaq presario
[08:22] <achandra> distanceisdeath: how much memory..??
[08:22] <distanceisdeath> 40
[08:22] <achandra> 40 mgs?
[08:22] <distanceisdeath> ive used 10
[08:22] <distanceisdeath> gigs
[08:22] <achandra> space..
[08:22] <welp> distanceisdeath, RAM
[08:22] <distanceisdeath> 256
[08:22] <jrsims> anyone know why keyboard input would suddenly stop working (keyboard is indeed plugged in)?
[08:23] <achandra> 256MB... will that work???hmmmmm.....thats kinda low these days...
[08:23] <whyami> it should install. Try typing "help" when it tells you to type enter. You might be able to type VESA or FAILSAFE or something like that. It'll tell you.
[08:23] <distanceisdeath> okay
[08:23] <distanceisdeath> brb
[08:23] <distanceisdeath> ill tell you what it says
[08:24] <distanceisdeath> i  typed help
[08:24] <welp> achandra, if it cam work (very badly...) on my laptop with 64Mb RAM, i'm SURE It'll work on 256Mb ;)
[08:24] <distanceisdeath> and it could not find kernal image
[08:24] <distanceisdeath> i thought you left welp?

[08:25] <distanceisdeath> there he goes
=== Thread-- is now known as Thread-
[08:25] <whyami> distanceisdeath: doesn't it say something about anything else you can type besides ENTER?
[08:25] <distanceisdeath> umm
[08:25] <distanceisdeath> lemme see
[08:25] <whyami> I can't remember the details but I am quite sure there are options and there is a way to see a list o fthem...
[08:25] <distanceisdeath> f1 for help
[08:25] <distanceisdeath> haha
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> server for network installation
[08:26] <achandra> welp: cool...by the way how do add the ability to download from different repos...kinda new to this schema..
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> welp left
[08:26] <whyami> any other options besides "server?"
[08:26] <achandra> darn
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> yeah
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> f1 for help
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> and
[08:26] <distanceisdeath> enter for default installation
[08:26] <whyami> nothing like "failsafe?"
[08:27] <achandra> i saw the pastebin....but how do you add the repo to list of available places to download?
[08:27] <distanceisdeath> i can try to type it in??
[08:27] <B_166-ER-X> is there anyone who have any idea how to get/install the armagetron movie pack on ubuntu ?
[08:27] <whyami> well---for lack of a better idea, try typing "server" since that appears to be your only option (weird...)
[08:27] <Pyru> Hello I followed an ndiswrapper tutorial and my card shows up as  {name of driver}  driver present, hardware present but in network utilites i cant see it listed.. so i cant configure it
[08:27] <distanceisdeath> nooo
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> there is F1 FOR HELP
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> do you want me to try that??
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> server dont work
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> i tried
[08:28] <whyami> yes. I thought you already had.
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> nahhh
[08:28] <distanceisdeath> lemme see when i press f1
[08:28] <whyami> okay, what are the options listed when you press f1?
[08:28] <achandra> Pyru: did you use a guide similar to this - http://www.aeonity.com/frost/ubuntu-breezy-badger-510-wireless-problems
[08:29] <distanceisdeath> list of stuff
[08:29] <distanceisdeath> like parameters
[08:29] <Pyru> achandra, I used https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper?action=show&redirect=SetupNdiswrapperHowto
[08:29] <whyami> anything like "vesa" or "failsafe?"
[08:29] <distanceisdeath> there is another help thing that may contain that
[08:29] <distanceisdeath> try it?
[08:30] <cyberix> How do I install a minimal Ubuntu system?
[08:30] <whyami> if there is some parameter or option that contains the word "failsafe" you should try....
[08:30] <rajeev> hey all ,any one here to help me i have getting some problem in sound actually i have 5.1 speaker but only two speaker working others are not working
[08:30] <whyami> cyberix: do the server install.
[08:30] <cyberix> I think I chose server installation, but Xorg is being installed.
[08:30] <[itrebal_sleep] > how can i setup mpg playback in Xine? i've got the video portion done (i dont know how) but the audio wont play, it says there isn't a suitable audio plugin. while using XMMS it'll play both audio and video, but the audio is terribly distorted (its echoing and shallow)
[08:31] <cyberix> Does the server system have Xorg or is it my error?
[08:31] <distanceisdeath> whyami...lemme see what i can do
[08:31] <spikeb> cyberix: no
[08:31] <achandra> Pyru: egad just went through this and got it working..not sure if he still around..also see - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Broadcom43xx?action=show&redirect=WiFiBroadcomDriver
[08:31] <spikeb> cyberix: server is command line only
[08:31] <achandra> Pyru: he had to use source from sourceforge to make it work..
[08:31] <cyberix> server == ubuntu-minimal
[08:31] <cyberix> ?
[08:32] <achandra> Pyru: is your card a bcm43xx as well?
[08:32] <Pyru> no achandra my card is a mini usb wireless pen size AOPEN
[08:32] <distanceisdeath> whyami....i didnt see anything
[08:32] <Pyru> wireless.
[08:32] <Pyru> its usb, not an internal card
[08:32] <distanceisdeath> i have one of those
[08:33] <tb77> [itrebal_sleep] : try the libxine-extracodecs package
[08:33] <Unenvarjo> cybe, pretty much yeah
[08:34] <distanceisdeath> whyami...any ideas?
[08:34] <Unenvarjo> if I recall correctly, even apache2 had to be installed separately, but I could be mistaken
[08:34] <distanceisdeath> whyami...i could try crux and see their options
[08:34] <whyami> distanceisdeath: I don't know what crux is. gimme a minute...
[08:35] <distanceisdeath> www.crux.nu
[08:35] <distanceisdeath> just call me distance
[08:35] <distanceisdeath> i dont like it when people spell it out
[08:35] <cyberix> Unenvarjo: Ok. Thanks. We'll see.
[08:35] <[itrebal_sleep] > tb77: thanks
[08:36] <Pyru> hmm i wonder where i went wrong lol
[08:36] <whyami> I'm doing tab-complete which is faster than typing "distance". Anyway, my only "shot in the dark" is to type "noapic nolapic" (without the quotes) as your parameters....
[08:36] <distanceisdeath> how do i do that??
[08:36] <distanceisdeath> just type it in the command line?
[08:36] <egad> Pyru, uhmm dunno how to setup your specific wifi device.. but I'd recommend if you havent to go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93482 and get version 1.16 and use that ..uninstall the older version first before installing
[08:36] <whyami> doesn't it say something like "boot: "? If so, type it there...
[08:36] <distanceisdeath> yeah
[08:37] <distanceisdeath> thats what ive had always
[08:37] <egad> also make sure to do a sudo modprobe ndiswrapper
[08:37] <whyami> so where it says "boot: " type noapic nolapic
[08:37] <distanceisdeath> whyami...doesnt find that kernal
[08:37] <qatsi> ok, im running the latest dapper version...why cant i have the new xgl and compiz stuff running ?
[08:38] <lew> I have a problem getting Totem to work !   Can anyone here help me?
[08:38] <distanceisdeath> whats totem?
[08:38] <Unenvarjo> totem is a movie player in gnome
[08:38] <Healot> lew, pay totem some money
[08:38] <distanceisdeath> thats cool
[08:38] <distanceisdeath> i think i like kde better
[08:38] <distanceisdeath> but im too lazy to get kubuntu
[08:38] <whyami> distanceisdeath: try putting the word "linux" in front (without quotes)
[08:39] <spikeb> heh

[08:39] <welkiner> anybody else having trouble with HD install from new rd desktop (livecd)
[08:40] <Pyru> hmmmmmmm

[08:41] <distanceisdeath> wtf
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> it says
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> "loading....file.........................................."
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> "loading...file..............................."
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> then shuts off
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> they are like .gz files or something
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> something must be wrong with the cd???
[08:41] <Unenvarjo> I have both gnome and kde on my desktop computer

[08:49] <distanceisdeath> woah
[08:49] <distanceisdeath> the other pne
[08:49] <knanand> is there something like Kontact in GNOME??
[08:49] <distanceisdeath> one
[08:49] <distanceisdeath> looked like it made progression

[08:51] <distanceisdeath> i appreciate it
[08:51] <lotuspsychje> anyone knows howto change macaddress with ifconfig
[08:52] <whyami> yep. Good luck from here. Linux is worth it an ubuntu is a fantastic distro. Stick with it.
[08:52] <distanceisdeath> yeah i will
[08:52] <laughlin> ifconfig eth0 hw ether <your mac addy>
[08:52] <distanceisdeath> cant wait for the new one i guess

[08:52] <laughlin> hum, what's the error output?
[08:52] <lotuspsychje> nothing
[08:52] <lotuspsychje> it changes alright
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> but when i reboot
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> same ip again
[08:53] <laughlin> and what kind of adapter are you using? ethernet or wifi
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> eth0
[08:53] <laughlin> humm.
[08:53] <laughlin> try #ifconfig eth0 down
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> first do eth down
[08:53] <laughlin> and then try to change it
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> then change
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> then up
[08:53] <lotuspsychje> yes
[08:53] <laughlin> yea

[08:54] <lotuspsychje> but when reboot
[08:54] <lotuspsychje> same ip
[08:54] <lotuspsychje> strange right
[08:54] <laughlin> well, the ifconfig doesn't change it permanently. you could write a simple bash script to change it on  boot up if you like.
[08:55] <lotuspsychje> oh ic
[08:55] <lotuspsychje> where is it stored
[08:55] <laughlin> if you wanted it changed to the same mac on boot up that is.
[08:55] <lotuspsychje> mac adress?
[08:55] <lotuspsychje> i want a perm change
[08:56] <laughlin> it's storred on the chip on you ethernet card
[08:56] <lotuspsychje> yeah lol

[08:57] <laughlin> no, i dunno. that's all i ever used
[08:58] <drumline> bash is best
[08:58] <hackson> i want to use some tools like setup that under fc.
[08:58] <laughlin> i'm assuming that you are using ubuntu?
[08:58] <Ratzilla> does anyone know which plugin for gaim is the one that notifies you when someone opens a window in msn?

[08:58] <lotuspsychje> laughlin:http://whoozoo.co.uk/mac-spoof-linux.htm#3

[09:00] <distanceisdeath> help on partitioning
[09:00] <fogos> hi someone knows how i can run a .php program with php-gtk
[09:00] <distanceisdeath> i have one hard drive
[09:00] <distanceisdeath> and i dont want to get rifd of all my stuff
[09:00] <distanceisdeath> what do i do?
[09:00] <distanceisdeath> im in the wizard right now
[09:02] <laughlin> any experienced UBUNTU users in here who also have extensive experience with GENTOO
[09:02] <Terminus> laughlin: ummm... what for?
[09:03] <laughlin> i have a question
[09:03] <distanceisdeath> need help on partitioning!!!
[09:03] <EdLin> apokryphos, the US archive works fine here
[09:03] <Terminus> laughlin: shoot.
[09:03] <Terminus> laughlin: i've had experience with gentoo, but that was a few years ago. if i can't, other people probably can.
[09:03] <apokryphos> EdLin: are you on breezy?
[09:04] <EdLin> apokryphos, yes
[09:04] <laughlin> i am an experienced gentoo user, (both server and desktop) but am fed up with gentoo not working on my laptop
[09:04] <lotuspsychje> i updated to dapper drake
[09:04] <lotuspsychje> and it rox!!
[09:04] <lotuspsychje> goes even faster
[09:04] <lotuspsychje> on 64 bit
[09:04] <apokryphos> EdLin: dapper reps look fine, and breezy ones look up at least. Could you just clarify that a sudo apt-get update works fully?
[09:04] <Terminus> laughlin: oh, if it's laptop, i've got zero laptop experience. you might as well ask anyway.
[09:04] <distanceisdeath> anyone please help me on partitioning
[09:05] <laughlin> my only questinon would be about the ubuntu package management sistem. i LOVE gentoo's and wound like to know if ubuntu's is as good
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> im afraid ill lose the windows installation
[09:05] <EdLin> apokryphos, I just did a aptitude update just to make sure, and it worked.
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> i dont care about the data on it
[09:05] <apokryphos> thanks
[09:05] <drumline> distance: what do you need?
[09:05] <Terminus> laughlin: it's different, but it's just as good. :)
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> thank you
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> im on the partitioning wizard
[09:05] <EdLin> apokryphos, thanks
[09:05] <drumline> ok
[09:05] <emdash> woot
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> and i have one hd
[09:05] <drumline> ok
[09:05] <laughlin> there is nothing better than #emerge -s gnome
[09:05] <emdash> ubuntu ppc on iBook
[09:05] <emdash> only trouble is ... one button wtf
[09:05] <distanceisdeath> and  i have to partition the hard drive
[09:05] <Terminus> laughlin: automatic dependency resolution. installing stuff is as simple as 'apt-get install foo'. if you're a gui guy, there's synaptic.
[09:05] <drumline> distance: do you have an external HD?
[09:05] <laughlin> or what ever, it spits out tons of packages, and i just  look for the right one, and bam
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> but im afraid ill lose the installation of windows
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> nah
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> i have a thrity gig master hd
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> but it wont work
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> i need a slave
[09:06] <Terminus> laughlin: you mean searching? "apt-cache search $foo" where $foo is a regex.
[09:06] <drumline> distance: get an external HD.  Download Acronis True Image trial from www.acronis.com.  Make a backup image of your drive before you do anything with it that you are uncertain of.
[09:06] <laughlin> so to search for a package i just use that command?
[09:06] <distanceisdeath> i cant just buy an external hd
[09:07] <drumline> distance: playing with things you don't fully understand is asking for trouble.
[09:07] <Terminus> laughlin: yes.
[09:07] <apokryphos> laughlin: yes, that searches descriptions and names
[09:07] <distanceisdeath> haha
[09:07] <Terminus> laughlin: you can even do stuff like apt-cache search ^gnome
[09:07] <distanceisdeath> well am i gonna lose the actual installation of the windows??
[09:07] <laughlin> cool, and i assume that there are ~ number of packages for ubuntu as well
[09:07] <drumline> distance: the sure way to protect yourself is to image that disk to another disk and if you screw it up, then fine, you just re-image the disk back to the snapshot.
[09:07] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:07] <drumline> distance: probably not, but there's always a chance if you tend to screw things up  :)
[09:07] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:08] <apokryphos> laughlin: ubuntu repositories have around 16000 packages altogether or so
[09:08] <distanceisdeath> if i do lose the windows installation
[09:08] <Terminus> laughlin: yep. everything under the sun. i have yet to compile stuff manually. except commercial apps of course.
[09:08] <distanceisdeath> what happens?
[09:08] <drumline> distance: anyway... it's probably simple... what do you see on your screen?
[09:08] <distanceisdeath> ummmmm
[09:08] <distanceisdeath> lemme check
[09:08] <emdash> n/win 5
[09:08] <laughlin> very good then, that does it, thanks guys for your hlep!
[09:08] <emdash> gar
[09:08] <Terminus> laughlin: for maximum convenience though, just enable the universe and multiverse repos. they're not enabled by default.
[09:08] <apokryphos> laughlin: for a few 3rd-party proprietary packs (javadebs, etc) see /msg ubotu seveas
[09:08] <laughlin> sounds good
[09:09] <drumline> distance: if you lose the wind ows installation, then you can still get your data back if you don't fry the partition's data...  You can fry the boot sector and still keep your data.
[09:09] <apokryphos> sun-java debs, that is.
[09:09] <distanceisdeath> i really dont care about the data
[09:09] <distanceisdeath> i jsut want the actual windows os
[09:09] <drumline> well... just make sure not to delete the Windows partition... Just resize it.
[09:09] <distanceisdeath> or is that what you mean by data?
[09:09] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:09] <distanceisdeath> i see
[09:09] <drumline> that's what I mean
[09:09] <Pyru> achandra, you around?
[09:09] <Terminus> laughlin: yeah, w32codecs should be installed manually because of legal issues.
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> number one primary 4.5 gigs
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> numbr two primary 35.7
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> and
[09:10] <Terminus> laughlin: there's a package floating around though so no need for doing it the hard way.
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> 7.7 gigs free space
[09:10] <laughlin> ok, thanks
[09:10] <drumline> 7.7 should be enough to play with Ubuntu...  are you cool with that?
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> yeah i guess
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> how much free space will i have for programming and crap?
[09:11] <laughlin> http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/12/04/libdvdcss2-and-w32codecs-for-ubuntu/
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> lemme ask you this
[09:11] <Charredheart> around 6
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> crux a better idea?
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> 6 gigs?
[09:11] <Charredheart> yep. give or take
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> oh
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> thats plenty
[09:12] <dnite> Can anyone help me out here? I'm not sure where the configuration for network setup is. I need to add the -R paramater to dhcpcd so it doesn't overwrite my resolv.conf file...
[09:12] <apokryphos> laughlin: first it's really best to see the wiki entry on adding repositories and/or what ones you'll want. /msg ubotu repositories
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> so what do i do dum?
[09:12] <drumline> distance: depends on how much shtuff you install...  You'll probably have 6 on a decently configured computer.
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:12] <drumline> maybe 5.5 or 5 if you like extra stuff.
[09:12] <apokryphos> laughlin: to see the methodology behind the split main/restricted/universe/multiverse main repositories, see /msg ubotu components
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> thats wha the other guy said
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> thats fine
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> five is great
[09:12] <laughlin> hey, has the MPlayer support on ubuntu gotten better? a while back ago i heard it was crappy
[09:12] <laughlin> apokryphos: thanks
[09:13] <apokryphos> laughlin: it should work fine
[09:13] <apokryphos> though I only ever use kaffeine
[09:13] <laughlin> apokryphos: thansk
[09:13] <Terminus> laughlin: totem-xine seems to work ok too. :)
[09:13] <laughlin> bery good, bery bery good!
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-workex
[09:13] <Terminus> laughlin: the part i hate about mplayer is the fact that gmplayer can't play stuff off samba shares. :|
[09:13] <distanceisdeath> do  i go ahead and press the 7.7 one??
[09:14] <Terminus> laughlin: unless you mount it. no integration with gnome/kde/etc.
[09:14] <distanceisdeath> kde looks so tight
[09:14] <laughlin> ok, good to know.
[09:14] <dnite> anyone know where I can modify my default network setup? I just need to add -R to whereever dhcpcd is run so it doesn't overwrite my resolve.conf ...
[09:14] <ppcguy> hey all what is the channel for dapper stuff?
[09:15] <apokryphos> ppcguy: #ubuntu+1
[09:15] <Terminus> ppcguy: #ubuntu+1 till june 1
[09:15] <ppcguy> many thanks guys
[09:15] <drumline> distance: it is.  :)
[09:15] <chrisx2> hey can any1 help with thiserror,  Can't find kernel build files in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/build
[09:15] <distanceisdeath> what is?
[09:15] <drumline> KDE
[09:15] <distanceisdeath> yeah
[09:15] <distanceisdeath> i want it
[09:15] <distanceisdeath> but i have gnome
[09:15] <distanceisdeath> oh well
[09:15] <Pyru> how do i install a tar file? lol sorry im very new
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> so do i press the 7.7 gigs?
[09:16] <apokryphos> distanceisdeath: very easy to install kde; just sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:16] <Terminus> Pyru: you don't install it. it's like a zip file.
[09:16] <Ratzilla> pyru: use the tar command
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> thats great man
[09:16] <TheLazy1> hello, can someone help me get ubuntu ppc installed on my powerbook g3? all I get is a corrupt screen after running bootx
[09:16] <apokryphos> distanceisdeath: 7.7 gigs is more than enough for ubuntu, yup.
[09:16] <drumline> distance: you can use KDE
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> but i need linux on my computer first
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:16] <drumline> distance: Just install all the packages for KDE...  OR download the Kubuntu image.
[09:16] <Terminus> Pyru: tar xvf should extract it. compression is taken care of by other tools like gzip or bzip2. they use the z and j flag respectively.
[09:16] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: if you use that command, will that install everything that kubuntu has? it wont overwrite gnome will  it?
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> HAHAHA
[09:16] <distanceisdeath> im retarded
[09:17] <distanceisdeath> that is a 7.7 MEGS
[09:17] <apokryphos> drumline: the recommended is to install kubuntu-desktop
[09:17] <distanceisdeath> not gigs
[09:17] <TheLazy1> If I select no video driver there is no console text, but the installation screen shows up
[09:17] <Charredheart> 7.7 megs probably won't be large enough :)
[09:17] <apokryphos> Ratzilla: it will install the recommended kubuntu desktop, and won't touch any gnome stuff. They can happily exist together :)
[09:17] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:17] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: cuz i installed kde..but not kubuntu-desktop..
[09:17] <distanceisdeath> so i have the other 35.7 gbs
[09:17] <Pyru> Terminus, now it extracted to a folder on my desktop
[09:17] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: thanks :) ill install it
[09:17] <distanceisdeath> what do i do?
[09:17] <Pyru> how do i install it, its the latest version of ndiswrapper
[09:17] <Healot> yay
[09:18] <p00f> http://tinyurl.com/568a
[09:18] <Healot> already request for the CD
[09:18] <Terminus> Pyru: you're gonna have to read the documentation of ndiswrapper.
[09:18] <chrisx2> Pyru, im tryin that, i get an error
[09:18] <chrisx2> hey can any1 help with thiserror,  Can't find kernel build files in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/build
[09:18] <apokryphos> Ratzilla: it just means you won't get a few of the kubuntu-recommended packages (which includes konversation, amaroK...). You can see the different "routes" for installing kde by visiting wiki.kubuntu.org/InstallingKDE
[09:18] <kuja> What's the common VNC port that Vino listens on by default?
[09:18] <distanceisdeath> drumline...what do i do?
[09:18] <chrisx2> kuja, 5900 ??
[09:18] <kuja> chrisx2: Thanks
[09:19] <apokryphos> chrisx2: what is it you're trying to do? Looks like you want to install your respective kernel headers
[09:19] <Terminus> chrisx2: maybe you need the kernel headers? just guessing here.
[09:19] <chrisx2> okay im tryin to complie ndiswrapper
[09:20] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: thanks very much :)
[09:20] <apokryphos> chrisx2: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r), also make sure you've read /msg ubotu ndiswrapper
[09:20] <GratefulDead> hello I have a problem to solve in the conversion of files
[09:20] <Pyru> i just downloaded latest ndiswrapper source then untarred it now its on a folder on my desktop , dont know how to install it lol
[09:20] <distanceisdeath> Charredheart
[09:20] <TheLazy1> any help for missing console text with ubuntu ppc?
[09:20] <Corey> guys guys
[09:20] <distanceisdeath> do you know what your doing?
[09:20] <chrisx2> ty apokryphos
[09:20] <Corey> im about to update to dapper drake is that alright ?
[09:20] <kuja> Corey: I've been using it for a couple months now and I've been happy.
[09:20] <Terminus> Pyru: if it's like most stuff though, installing it should be something like "./configure; make; sudo make install" you really should read the documentation though.
[09:21] <apokryphos> Corey: it should be, yes. The release candidate has just been released.
[09:21] <Madpilot> Corey, that depends... but even if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces ;)
[09:21] <Charredheart> ?
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> charred with the partitioning?
[09:21] <Corey> alright well im going to upgrade from terminal :)
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> can you help?
[09:21] <GratefulDead> I have to convert FAX G3 format to ps or pdf, any suggestion?
[09:21] <aaaaa> who know what the canonical QA employment is going on?
[09:21] <apokryphos> Corey: you can use the update manager to do everything for you, if you like.
[09:21] <Charredheart> i didn't partition this hdd when i installed it
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> all right
[09:21] <Charredheart> i gave it all 80 gb that it had :-/
[09:21] <Corey> um just reading the tutorial now :)
[09:21] <apokryphos> aaaaa: sorry?
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> well can anyone help me with the partitioning?
[09:21] <apokryphos> cool
[09:21] <Corey> lucky i have 22mbit connection :)
[09:22] <apokryphos> distanceisdeath: what's the problem?
[09:22] <apokryphos> Corey: ni-ice =)
[09:22] <Charredheart> I'm sure the instructions aren't hard. do you need to keep any space on there for another OS?
[09:22] <distanceisdeath> i have to partition my 35.7 gigs
[09:22] <Corey> yeah :D
[09:22] <aaaaa> Has ubuntu got a appropriate QA person?
[09:22] <GratefulDead> distanceisdeath, it depends, it's a blank disk and you jave to install another OS?
[09:22] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: i have a partition layout here with the same size. you wanna see it? :)
[09:22] <distanceisdeath> no
[09:22] <K-DawG> does any1 have a god guide to install Nvidia drivers?
[09:22] <Madpilot> aaaaa, they hired someone for QA last month
[09:22] <distanceisdeath> i have windows on there taking up ten gigs
[09:22] <kuja> K-DawG: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[09:22] <distanceisdeath> and i wanna save windows
[09:22] <lotuspsychje_> how do i change grub settings?
[09:22] <distanceisdeath> and give ubuntu ten gigs
[09:22] <GratefulDead> distanceisdeath: want to use all the HD for linux then?
[09:23] <Ratzilla> K-DawG: the wiki is pretty good , use synaptic
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> nooo
[09:23] <kuja> lotuspsychje: sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> i want windows too
[09:23] <p00f> I dont understand this  http://tinyurl.com/z5n8x
[09:23] <lotuspsychje_> kuja tnx!!
[09:23] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: well, what i did was i made minimal space for the required mount points and the rest just goes to /home.
[09:23] <K-DawG> kuja, is that all?
[09:23] <kuja> You're welcome
[09:23] <Corey> um does all 5.10 software work on drake ?
[09:23] <kuja> K-DawG: Pretty much
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> terminus??? what?
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> jsut what did you do
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> im in the middle of the partition wizard
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> and i wanna give it ten gigs
[09:23] <Ratzilla> K-DawG: after you install, you gotta type sudo nvidia-glx-config enable ...i think thats it
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> and not affect the windows
[09:23] <distanceisdeath> installation
[09:24] <distanceisdeath> i dont care about my files and music
[09:24] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: oh, just 10GB. is the entire hard disk taken up by windows?
[09:24] <K-DawG> Raskall, oki il give it a try thanx
[09:24] <kuja> Madpilot: Turned off by it, I guess :P
[09:24] <distanceisdeath> i believe not
[09:24] <distanceisdeath> it says
[09:24] <GratefulDead> distanceisdead: ok then you have the remaining part of the disk blank right?
[09:24] <Corey> updatig now wish me luck :)
[09:24] <distanceisdeath> around ten gigs are being used
[09:24] <Corey> updating**
[09:24] <Corey> updating wont wipe any data will it ?
[09:25] <Madpilot> Corey, not your own user data, unless something goes badly wrong
[09:25] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: ok, and you want ubuntu to take up 10GB too?
[09:25] <Corey> ok awseome
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> gratefuldead....its death
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> yes
[09:25] <Corey> I wish the servers gave me full speed :(
[09:25] <GratefulDead> distance: when you run the installation process you can choose the blank space to be allocated and formatted ext3 or any other journaled fs do you like
[09:25] <Corey> im only downloading at 500 :(
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> and that leaves another five gigs for more windows c***
[09:25] <Corey> whats changed in dapper drake ?
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> huh?
[09:25] <GratefulDead> distance but you have to allocate something like your RAM*2 for swap
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> what?
[09:26] <distanceisdeath> i just wanna give linux ten gigs
[09:26] <Ratzilla> you dont NEED swap..but if you want more virtual memory...
[09:26] <distanceisdeath> thats it
[09:26] <Terminus> Corey: simplest thing i can think of is 128MB for /boot, 2x your ram for swap, and the rest for /
=== seth is now known as seth|away
[09:26] <Corey> Terminus: wrong person buddy :P
[09:26] <Terminus> whoops... distanceisdeath i mean. =D
[09:26] <Terminus> Corey: yeah... sorry. hehe
[09:26] <Corey> Terminus: whats good about drake ?
[09:26] <distanceisdeath> waht??
[09:27] <distanceisdeath> terminus what did you send me?
[09:27] <GratefulDead> Ratzilla: swap is not anymore used?? why you say that?
[09:27] <distanceisdeath> the corey thing?
[09:27] <Corey> whats good about dapper drake ?
[09:27] <Ratzilla> GratefulDead: no, it is, but if you install it without swap, it wont complain...you just have less virtual memory
[09:28] <distanceisdeath> if i lose the windows installation can that be fixed!?
[09:28] <GratefulDead> Ratzilla: if you run a machine with low RAM it will complain a lot =)
[09:28] <Madpilot> if you've got 1Gb or more, swap really isn't needed. Under that, it's optional but nice to have.
[09:28] <apokryphos> Corey: there will likely be an official announcement with a better summary, but: all-round upgraded packages, sync again with debian unstable, new Xorg, new GNOME
[09:28] <granden> Hi, dont ubuntu have any cron jobs that run all scripts in /etc/cron.daily cron.monthly etc
[09:28] <Ratzilla> GratefulDead: lol yeah it will i guess, i just meant that you dont need swap..its just a lot better to have it
[09:29] <Terminus> Corey: drake?
[09:29] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: simplest thing i can think of is 128MB for /boot, 2x your ram for swap, and the rest for /
[09:29] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: i can't guide you through which menu item to go to and what to enter coz i don't memorize those stuff.
[09:29] <distanceisdeath> all right
[09:29] <GratefulDead> Ratzilla: i always use swap space, even running a machine with 2 gigs RAM, because if you install much RAM it means you need it =)
[09:29] <distanceisdeath> hmmm
[09:29] <Corey> wicked
[09:29] <distanceisdeath> if i lose windows can i get it back?
[09:29] <Terminus> Corey: sorry. bad lag. :|
[09:29] <GratefulDead> distance: you wont lose it if you dont touch its partioton
[09:29] <distanceisdeath> i have to
[09:30] <GratefulDead> distance: why?
[09:30] <distanceisdeath> its the only partition for thats available
[09:30] <distanceisdeath> (has enough space)
[09:30] <apokryphos> Corey: aha, here http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
[09:30] <Terminus> Corey: lots of stuff. like the preempt kernel, bash-completion works out of the box, etc.
[09:30] <apokryphos> ubotu: dapperchanges is at http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
[09:30] <ubotu> okay, apokryphos
[09:30] <GratefulDead> distance: so as i understood you have all the disk partitoned vfat or ntfs right?
[09:30] <Corey> hopefully its better than 5.10 cause 5.10 is mad
[09:30] <apokryphos> why?
[09:30] <distanceisdeath> i believe so
[09:31] <Corey> mad=cool
[09:31] <apokryphos> Terminus: full bash-completion is enabled by default? Hm.
[09:31] <apokryphos> Corey: :)
[09:31] <Ratzilla> yeah 5.10 is kicking ass for me right now
[09:31] <distanceisdeath> i jsut wanna give linux ten of those free gigs
[09:31] <Terminus> apokryphos: yep. tab completion for command options. =D
[09:31] <GratefulDead> distance: then i suggest you to run from windows enviroment something like partition magic to resize the windows partition
[09:31] <Ratzilla> used it for about a week and i like it more than windows already
[09:31] <Corey> yeah
[09:31] <Ratzilla> distanceisdeath: how much ram do you have?
[09:31] <Corey> my 4th day on linux :D
[09:31] <distanceisdeath> 256
[09:31] <apokryphos> Terminus: ah, not full bash completion then? As in that in /etc/bash_completion
[09:31] <distanceisdeath> wait
[09:32] <distanceisdeath> i have an idea
[09:32] <Terminus> apokryphos: it's there.
[09:32] <GratefulDead> distance: then you will have a free space in the end of your hard disk for installing linux OS
[09:32] <apokryphos> Terminus: it's always there, but is it enabled by default?
[09:32] <apokryphos> Can't really check anymore
[09:32] <distanceisdeath> i have an extra hd...its master so i cant work a dual hard drive...any way i can just put linux on my useless one and switch back and forth?
[09:32] <Terminus> apokryphos: yep. it was enabled when i installed.
[09:32] <Ratzilla> distanceisdeath: probably best to find out because you'll want to allocate 2xram for swap space.  swap space is used like virtual memory in windows...
[09:32] <apokryphos> ok, interesting
[09:33] <distanceisdeath> grateful said to go on the windows os and get a partitioning program and partition off ten gigs
[09:33] <Corey> cant wait until its installed :>
[09:33] <distanceisdeath> is that a good idea?
[09:33] <Corey> use gparted
[09:33] <GratefulDead> anyone can help me? i need to convert FAX g3 files to ps, i can do from ps to FAX g3 thanks to gs but can't do the reverse
[09:33] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: is it possible to go into kde without logging out? or will i have to ctrl alt backspace?
[09:34] <Madpilot> distanceisdeath, you should be able to run two harddrives, regardless of which OSes your running - why is your 2nd HDD "useless"?
[09:34] <GratefulDead> distance: if your disk is still all allocated to fat32 or ntfs thats the easiest way
[09:34] <apokryphos> Ratzilla: it's a different desktop environment, so for the full experience you'll have to logout, yup. No need to ctrl+alt+backspace though, just select gnome's logout option. Select the different session from the GDM screen, then.
[09:34] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: according to other people, better defrag for ntfs partitions --> http://www.dirms.com/home/homepage.asp
[09:35] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: thanks :)
[09:35] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: that should help you when resizing.
[09:35] <Corey> !hmm
[09:35] <ubotu> Corey: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[09:35] <distanceisdeath> madpilot: its a primary from an old computer
[09:35] <Corey> gaim is crap :P
[09:35] <distanceisdeath> it wont fit the slave
[09:35] <kuja> Gaim is alright.
[09:35] <Corey> kopete is better
[09:35] <Terminus> Corey: crap would be something that doesn't work. :p
[09:35] <apokryphos> it's not great for IRC
[09:35] <Corey> haha well
[09:35] <Corey> lol
[09:36] <Corey> im using x-chat :)
[09:36] <fogos> hi someone use php-gtk
[09:36] <Corey> for irc
[09:36] <apokryphos> I prefer Kopete too 8)
[09:36] <kuja> I'm not a Qt fan, so I can't say.
[09:36] <distanceisdeath> terminus: whats defraging gonna do?
[09:36] <kuja> fogos: Don't be stupid. Use a better language for GUI development, such as Python or Ruby. PHP is NOT for GUI development.
[09:36] <Terminus> same here. except for the crash problem between kdesktop and kopete. :(
[09:36] <Corey> havent had that
[09:36] <Corey> im using gnome
[09:36] <kuja> Terminus: I like that font.
[09:36] <apokryphos> Terminus: what crashes?
[09:36] <Madpilot> distanceisdeath, you should be able to change the jumpers and change whether it's a master/slave/etc
[09:36] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: compact your filesystem before truncating the partition. you need that if you have to resize.
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> madpilot: dont know how
[09:37] <Corey> aparently dreamweaver 8 works in wine on dapper drake :D
[09:37] <fogos> kuja, i want a crossplataform languague
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> terminus:go to that website and do what it says?
[09:37] <Corey> I got flash 8.5 working :)
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> its getting over my head
[09:37] <spikeb> wxwindows
[09:37] <kuja> fogos: You can run Python or Ruby on Windows or Unix
[09:37] <fogos> kuja, python work?
[09:37] <Corey> flash player 8.5
[09:37] <Terminus> apokryphos: when i right click on a desktop item, kdesktop crashes. the kde people traced it to a problem with kopete.
[09:37] <Madpilot> distanceisdeath, have a look at the drive, most of them have a sticker showing what jumper positions work for which settings - also, google the drive name/id.
[09:37] <kuja> fogos: PHP is for web development, not GUI development.
[09:37] <apokryphos> Terminus: what version of KDE?
[09:38] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: not exactly. you have to understand for yourself how filesystems and partitions work.
[09:38] <distanceisdeath> pilot: how do you change it around?
[09:38] <Terminus> apokryphos: 5:45ubuntu1
[09:38] <Corey> php rawks
[09:38] <apokryphos> Terminus: kde-config --prefix?
[09:38] <kuja> Corey: Honestly, it sucks.
[09:38] <Corey> kuja: what do you program in
[09:38] <Terminus> apokryphos: /usr?
[09:38] <kuja> 3 years of PHP, and I'm proud I don't use it anymore.
[09:38] <kuja> Corey: Ruby.
[09:38] <distanceisdeath> terminus: cant i use a windows partitioning software and make a partition of ten gigs?
[09:38] <kuja> Sometimes Python... :P
[09:38] <apokryphos> Terminus: argh, s/prefix/version/, sorry
[09:39] <Terminus> kuja: PHP is convenient, but the libs are so messy!
[09:39] <Corey> ruby is crap harhahr
[09:39] <GratefulDead> argh, it seems no one can help me :-/
[09:39] <fogos> kuja, then if develop a program for unix , there is no change for run on windows?
[09:39] <GratefulDead> ;P
[09:39] <apokryphos> distanceisdeath: sure
[09:39] <Terminus> distanceisdeath: well, partitionmagic should probably work. a defrag is always recommend though.
[09:39] <kuja> fogos: No, no change. Except on Windows you still need the GTK runtime.
[09:39] <Madpilot> distanceisdeath, that depends on the drive - but google ATA jumpers for some howtos
[09:39] <distanceisdeath> partitionmagic sounds exciting
[09:39] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:39] <Terminus> apokryphos: KDE: 3.5.2 :)
[09:39] <kuja> Terminus: Messy, yes. Also, the encouraging of bad programming habits displeased me.
[09:39] <apokryphos> dapper?
[09:40] <Corey> i wonder if some os is being developed that owns all os's
[09:40] <GratefulDead> distance: its very easy to use, but remember, it's no free software :P
[09:40] <animato> hello, i have 2 users in my ubuntu installation, i want one user to use gnome and the other to use kde. is this possible? won't it mess up the menus with the gnome user seeing the kde app and vice versa?
[09:40] <distanceisdeath> shareware???
[09:40] <distanceisdeath> trial?
[09:40] <distanceisdeath> i need it once
[09:40] <Terminus> kuja: a lot of people find perl messy but the libs seem to look better to me than php.
[09:40] <GratefulDead> distance: maybe trial, but dunno
[09:40] <apokryphos> animato: all gnome applications can be run in kde and vice versa
[09:40] <animato> i know
[09:40] <animato> what i mean is
[09:40] <animato> i once tried installing the kubuntu desktop
[09:40] <apokryphos> animato: it's perfectly fine to have one user only using kde and the other on gnome, sure.
[09:40] <kuja> Terminus: If I knew Perl, I would probably use Perl more than I would PHP. Perl6 seems to be a turn on, from what it says it'll be.
[09:40] <GratefulDead> distance: btw use it one time and uninstall ;)
[09:40] <animato> and it added the kde apps to the gnome menu
[09:41] <kuja> Terminus: Once you go Ruby, you never go newbie.
[09:41] <apokryphos> animato: I think it might still do that, yes; you can edit your gnome menu however.
[09:41] <animato> any way to use both kde and gnome but make them less "messy"?
[09:41] <animato> oh right
[09:41] <distanceisdeath> http://www.soft32.com/download_151.html
[09:41] <Corey> kuja: give us an example of your ruby work..
[09:41] <distanceisdeath> trial right there
[09:41] <Terminus> kuja: yep. i've been writing snippets of perl here and there. i use it mostly for regex stuff or generating test data for sql.
[09:41] <animato> is there a way to edit the kde menu too?
[09:41] <GratefulDead> distance: you can look on the net for free or shareware programs, atm i cant remember the names
[09:41] <apokryphos> animato: of course, yes.
[09:41] <kuja> Corey: rubyforge.org/projects/duration && rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-extra
[09:41] <animato> ok kewl! thanx
[09:41] <Terminus> kuja: ruby is on my list of languages to learn together with python but i just haven't had the time. :|
[09:41] <animato> one last question, never used kde too much, does it have the automatic update app?
[09:42] <animato> like gnome does
[09:42] <apokryphos> animato: personally I put all the applications under a gnome > sub-menu
[09:42] <apokryphos> animato: yes
[09:42] <animato> oh ok, thank you
[09:44] <kuja> Terminus: That's one reason I love Ruby--There's less obfuscation unlike Perl, and regexes are also first-class citizens *like* Perl.
[09:44] <distanceisdeath> lemme try to use partition magic...just uninstall when im done
[09:44] <kuja> Terminus: Beware though, if you don't like magical adventures, then Ruby might not be for you. Ruby strays from the more traditional programming concepts and dives into more dynamics.

[09:49] <achandra> apokryphos: makes sense...nice explanation..
[09:49] <apokryphos> achandra: after that it's just a case of learning the different options; rpm and .debs aren't all that different, it's just the options that change.
[09:50] <apokryphos> of course, package management on your rpm-based distro is likely to be different

[10:00] <Healot> dewbie, the driver is for LINUX, which ubuntu IS
[10:00] <kholerabbi> Um.. I tried going to the download page on sourceforge, but I'm not sure which one to download (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=235&package_id=253&release_id=405479) There seams to be individual versions for other distros but not ubuntu..
[10:00] <Healot> you need to compile. etc...
[10:00] <dewbie> its asking me to rpm something in the readme
[10:00] <Xyloc> Can anybody help me to configure X for my Savage MX/IX so that it will use the full 1024x768 resolution?
[10:00] <kholerabbi> Is it possible just to use apt ?
[10:01] <Xyloc> kholerabbi, if in doubt, use .deb-packages, these are usually fully compatible with ubuntu
[10:01] <dewbie> I didn't know you could RPM anything
[10:02] <Xyloc> kholerabbi, have you already activated universe and multiverse for apt-get?
[10:02] <kholerabbi> xyloc: there is no debian packages?
[10:02] <kholerabbi> No, not that I'm aware of?
[10:02] <munckfish> dewbie: I think you use a tools called alien to deal with rpms on ubuntu
[10:02] <richiefrich> kholerabbi rpm then use alien
[10:02] <dewbie> alien?
[10:02] <Healot> dewbie: read the 3.a. TAR INSTRUCTIONS
[10:02] <dewbie> ok
[10:02] <richiefrich> alien to change to dep
[10:02] <dewbie> got that
[10:03] <Xyloc> kholerabbi, if there are rpm's, you can use alien to convert them
[10:03] <richiefrich> dewbie ok
[10:03] <dewbie> ohhhhh
[10:03] <Xyloc> see: munckfish
[10:03] <dewbie> ok
[10:03] <drcode> hi all
[10:03] <richiefrich> dewbie it's really nice
[10:03] <dewbie> alien or the actual driver
[10:03] <dewbie> ?
[10:03] <drcode> any one know in Xfree86 3.x how I can setup other language keyboard mode change?
[10:03] <Healot> alien handles the alien registration like the M.I.B
[10:04] <richiefrich> dewbie  install it  deb to rpm or rpm to deb
[10:04] <Xyloc> kholerabbi: Sometimes you're stuck with the old-fashioned way: download tarball, ./configure && install
[10:04] <richiefrich> apt-get installl alien
[10:04] <Healot> dewbie: did you read the readme file for that driver source yet?
[10:04] <Xyloc> drcode, you can access keyboard mode through Preferences-> Keyboard Layouts on your Ubuntu panel.
[10:05] <drcode> I have other distro
[10:05] <drcode> it write in  other language, only if I old ALT key all the time
[10:05] <dewbie> driver source?
[10:06] <drumline> switch your layout to Dvorak and enjoy
[10:06] <Xyloc> I have question about X-Server: I need the proper settings for my Savage-IX/MX on my Toshiba Tecra 8100
[10:06] <achandra> Opticalia: okay the make on the other box still complains about gcc-3.4 being installed...will an apt-get install gcc-3.4 do it? ..
[10:06] <drcode> I want to switch between two languages
[10:06] <Xyloc> drumline: please be sure that he can type 10 finger-blind first ;-)
[10:06] <deadcake> excuse me
[10:06] <deadcake> who can help me with wifi?
[10:06] <richiefrich> drcode why Xfree not xorg
[10:06] <deadcake> i have a wireless router
[10:06] <blind> me!
[10:06] <Opticalia> achandra, dunno.. if it wont work, you can uninstall it
[10:07] <Xyloc> richifrich, stupid of me, I meant X.org
[10:07] <Opticalia> i think it works
[10:07] <blakeG5> hello
[10:07] <deadcake> and i have another pc with a pci wifi card with edubuntu, it recognize the card, but i can't get connected?
[10:07] <richiefrich> Xyloc  u didnt say it drcode did
[10:07] <deadcake> who can help me?
[10:07] <Xyloc> I'm an early starter, having run RH5.0
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
[10:07] <dewbie> ok alien is installed
[10:07] <blind> deadcake, type !wifi
[10:08] <deadcake> !wifi
[10:08] <ubotu> I guess wifi is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WiFiHowto
[10:08] <Xyloc> Well, Richiefrich, can you help me with X.org?
[10:08] <distanceisdeath> 10000 megs equal 10 gigs correct?
[10:08] <richiefrich> Xyloc what do u need ?
[10:08] <blind> roughly, distanceisdeath
[10:08] <distanceisdeath> thank you
[10:08] <blind> 1024mb = 1gb
[10:08] <blakeG5> is there a channel for people using ubuntu on ppc machines?
[10:08] <blakeG5> or can i ask about it in here?
[10:08] <Madpilot> blakeG5, this is it
[10:09] <blakeG5> o cool
[10:09] <dewbie> now how the hell do I build and install and run this graphics driver
[10:09] <blakeG5> i just bought a dual 2.0 power mac
[10:09] <dewbie> -hll
[10:09] <dds> Is there a preferred gnome app for posting blog posts?
[10:09] <welp> ok, how do i do that weirdo thing to re-config the resolution thingie? dpgk-something isn't it?
[10:09] <Xyloc> richiefrich, I have a S3 Savage MX/IX videocard an I want to run it in the proper 1024x768 resolution
[10:09] <blakeG5> the old one with 2 G5's in it, not the new one
[10:09] <drcode> xorg dosnt work in that old computer
[10:09] <blakeG5> what?
[10:09] <welp> !resolution
[10:09] <ubotu> resolution is probably at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[10:09] <richiefrich> Xyloc then edit the xorg.conf
[10:09] <blakeG5> it works fine even it a G4
[10:10] <blakeG5> in*
[10:10] <richiefrich> welp ty
[10:10] <Xyloc> Richiefrich, I tried that, but it it justs comes back at 800x600
[10:10] <dewbie> I forgot hw to build install and run something in linux :(
[10:10] <kholerabbi> OK, thanks  xyloc
[10:10] <Xyloc> Richiefrich, in Windows98 I get 1024x768 though.
[10:11] <richiefrich> Xyloc ok then whats your Depth
[10:11] <octan> is it posseble to hide a dir without having to mkdir .NAME or mv DIR .DIR ?
[10:11] <blakeG5> ya, delete it
[10:11] <blakeG5> haha
[10:11] <richiefrich> Xyloc  if it's 24  try 16
[10:11] <Xyloc> Richiefrich: 16 Mill. Colors
[10:11] <richiefrich> no
[10:11] <richiefrich> in xorg.conf
[10:11] <Xyloc> Richiefrich: 16bit, I mean.
[10:11] <richiefrich> Depth 24         Depth 16
[10:11] <Xyloc> That would be 16
[10:11] <Healot> 16 mil color = 24bit
[10:12] <Xyloc> Healot, thx!
[10:12] <Healot> hench "Depth 24"
[10:12] <richiefrich> u have   -->  Depth 16?
[10:12] <Xyloc> FYI, I've got 8MB of VRAM
[10:12] <octan> paste your xorg.conf tyo pastebin.com
[10:12] <Healot> Depth 16 = 16bit color = 64K color
[10:12] <Xyloc> richiefrich, yes, it runs fine in Win9x
[10:12] <Xyloc> Using 1024x768x16bit
[10:13] <octan> <Healot> 16 = 65353 colors :p
[10:13] <Healot> 8MB Vram can reach up to 1024x768 60Hz 24bit
[10:13] <richiefrich> Xyloc  your not in wondows now, pastbin xorg.conf
[10:13] <octan> erm 535
[10:13] <drcode> xorg dosnt work in that old computer
[10:13] <drumline> Xyloc:  no way.... toss him into Dvorak.  He'll swim just fine.  :)
[10:13] <richiefrich> drcode how old
[10:13] <Healot> 64K = that's what I said
[10:13] <richiefrich> drcode  what is it ?
[10:13] <richiefrich> drcode  286
[10:13] <richiefrich> uname -a
[10:14] <Xyloc> 286?, hmm?, you should run ELKS on it then
[10:14] <Xyloc> ELKS = Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset
[10:14] <richiefrich> Xyloc im trying to find out what he's on
[10:14] <octan> <Healot> i know :) i just used desimals :P .. not all know that 1K = 1024 Bytes
[10:14] <richiefrich> he doesnt say
[10:14] <Xyloc> http://elks.sourceforge.net
[10:14] <drumline> 286?  haha... no way...   Not the SVGA X
[10:14] <octan> or in this case 1024 colors
[10:14] <sladen> Healot: no, you need 2MB for 1024x768@24 bit
[10:15] <richiefrich> drcode  what u on?  uname -a
[10:15] <Xyloc> Anyway, I've got enough mem for 1024x768x16
[10:15] <Healot> sladen, doesn't matter
[10:15] <Xyloc> That's not the problem
[10:15] <richiefrich> Xyloc  your not in wondows now, pastbin xorg.conf
[10:16] <octan> paste your xorg.conf to pastebin.com
[10:16] <richiefrich> octan i guess he wont
[10:16] <Xyloc> Richifrich, I am in Windows now, checkmy Chatzilla signature...
[10:16] <richiefrich> Xyloc boot to linux
[10:16] <richiefrich> cant fix linux from windows
[10:16] <octan> richiefrich then hes not willing to get much help.. lets all just guess whats wrong :p
[10:17] <Xyloc> Just a moment while I boot my Toshiba Tecra 8100
[10:17] <richiefrich> unless u have two computers
[10:17] <distanceisdeath> does anyone know how to use partition magic?
[10:17] <richiefrich> octan i cant guess
[10:17] <alth> Greetings ^_^
[10:17] <Xyloc> distancheisdeath: Whcih version are you using?
[10:17] <distanceisdeath> 8 trial
[10:17] <octan> <richiefrich> sry my english isnt the best :P
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> im trying to take ten gigs off my c
[10:18] <octan> <distanceisdeath> whats up..
[10:18] <octan> just resize it
[10:18] <richiefrich> octan  u see my comment  :)
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> i am
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> now
[10:18] <crazy_penguin> good mornin' ! // jo napot!// buna ziua! :)
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> no***
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> im making a new partition
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> and taking the memory off of the c drive
[10:18] <drumline> distance: http://gparted.sourceforge.net
[10:19] <octan> richiefrich :)
[10:19] <distanceisdeath> and it says operations pending
[10:19] <distanceisdeath> but it doesnt do anything
[10:19] <richiefrich> octan it's true :)
[10:19] <drumline> distance: that sucker supposedly can resize NTFS and FAT32 partitions
[10:19] <octan> richiefrich, yea i know
[10:19] <babo> did someone say earlier that it was possible to boot up with dapper without burning a cd ?
[10:19] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: Follow that link Drumline supplied to you, gparted is great
[10:19] <babo> welp maybe ...? ^^
[10:19] <drumline> Xyloc: you've used it successfully many times?
[10:19] <Healot> PM does excellent job on resizing NTFS, even the new version
[10:19] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: YEs
[10:19] <drumline> Xyloc: I just burnt the sucker seconds ago for the first time
[10:20] <distanceisdeath> what do i do with this gnome thing?
[10:20] <Xyloc> drumine: Yes, I've used gparted many times with success
[10:20] <distanceisdeath> im on windows not liux
[10:20] <distanceisdeath> linux
[10:20] <twopeak> is there a nice way to see what computers are on the network and connect to them?
[10:20] <drumline> distance: burn the gparted live cd...  it's a boot disc.
[10:20] <Xyloc> Me too, but I'm booting Ubuntu on my Toshiba right now... (Cowers in shame)
[10:20] <distanceisdeath> i cant burn anything
[10:20] <distanceisdeath> i have no cds
[10:21] <drumline> Xyloc: shame?  why?
[10:21] <drumline> distance: FLUNK
[10:21] <distanceisdeath> haha
[10:21] <alth> Hey Xyloc, what Toshiba is it?
[10:21] <distanceisdeath> how do you resize the partition?
[10:21] <munckfish> I have a nasty lockup problem in Breezy relating to my wireless connection. Forum post is here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180160. I'm not a complete noob, but not dealt with a serious system issue like this before. I've given up on the searhcing the logs as it appears no relevant errors are logged just before it hangs. Can anyone give me any tips on lower level debugging?
[10:21] <Xyloc> Well, to join an Ubuntu chat-channel whilst using WindowsXP....
[10:21] <drumline> distance: not with native windows programs, as far as I know.
[10:22] <distanceisdeath> the other kids said i could
[10:22] <kevor> Hello, when i try to update, i click "Update" in the screen i get when clicking the popup saying i need updates. It gets to updating, but nothing happens, the updates are not installed...
[10:22] <alth> Xyloc, I do that all the time, when I have a problem with my laptop, I boot my desktop :P
[10:22] <Xyloc> Ah, Ubuntu has started, I'll start a new chatsession on my other box...
[10:22] <dewbie> so then does anyone know how to compile and install a tarball?
[10:22] <richiefrich> Xyloc we need linux info please load it, if your not yet
[10:22] <drumline> distance: did the other kids tell you exactly how?  :)
[10:22] <octan> distanceisdeath if the fat | nfts is bigger than 10 GB its not problem.. but if you wanna use some space from ext2|3 your out of luck
[10:22] <richiefrich> Xyloc cool
[10:22] <drumline> dewbie: man tar.  :)
[10:22] <dewbie> I got that
[10:22] <dewbie> its un tarred
[10:22] <Xyloc> dewbie: That's easy, just tar -xvzf <filename>
[10:22] <dewbie> err
[10:22] <dewbie> I need to build it
[10:22] <Xyloc> That's from the commandline....
[10:23] <dewbie> and install it
[10:23] <drumline> dewbie: C to create a tar...
[10:23] <distanceisdeath> i just wanna have a partition for linux
[10:23] <kevor> dewbie: ./configure --help
[10:23] <Xyloc> dewbie, trie ./configure
[10:23] <distanceisdeath> ten gigs
[10:23] <twopeak> !network
[10:23] <ubotu> This refers to a group of interconnected computers. The computers must be capable of transferring data to form a true network--you can't just weld a bunch of computers together.
[10:23] <distanceisdeath> and i wanna take it off my c drive
[10:23] <drumline> dewbie: but read your man pages...  you'll learn a ton of other cool tricks that you didn't know were possible.
[10:23] <kevor> dewbie: but in the directory that has just been created after doing $ tar xfvz file
[10:23] <bintrue> Is anyone able to download the 6.06 torrent?
[10:23] <twopeak> anyone has better info than that?
[10:23] <octan> distanceisdeath how many partition do you have?
[10:24] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath, did you Defrag before rearrangin your partitions?
[10:24] <octan> 1? c only?
[10:24] <drumline> dewbie: sorry... lowercase c
[10:24] <dewbie> lol
[10:24] <dewbie> ok so read the man pages
[10:24] <alth> Hmm. Should I upgrade to the Dapper beta on my laptop?
[10:24] <dewbie> fine
[10:24] <Xyloc> Rolling on Ubuntu::Xchat
[10:24] <spikeb> dapper is RC now, not beta. :)
[10:24] <drumline> dewbie: seriously...  :)  There are jewels in the man pages...   and you don't need to read the whole thing if you don't want to.
[10:25] <haakonn> what is the kernel source package in dapper called?
[10:25] <dewbie> its telling me bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
[10:25] <visik_> is reiser from dapper installer still unavailable ?
[10:25] <distanceisdeath> i have one partition
[10:25] <distanceisdeath> no i didnt defrag
[10:25] <drumline> Xyloc: have you used the live cd of  gparted?
[10:25] <Xyloc_> So, now I'm talking from my Ubuntu box...
[10:25] <drumline> dewbie: make sure you have a configure file in your current dir
[10:25] <dewbie> I don't
[10:26] <dewbie> oh shit
[10:26] <dewbie> its called config
[10:26] <dewbie> heh
[10:26] <Xyloc_> drumline: I used Knoppix, which includes gparted
[10:26] <octan> distanceisdeath so whats so hard? open partiton magic and rezise it
[10:26] <dewbie> wait
[10:26] <drumline> dewbie: so the file is called 'config' ?
[10:26] <drumline> usually it's configure
[10:26] <drumline> well.. what the heck...
[10:26] <drumline> ./config
[10:26] <distanceisdeath> okay octan
[10:26] <distanceisdeath> lemme give it a go
[10:26] <dewbie> tried that
[10:27] <Xyloc_> octan, if he has'nt defragged first, he'll be in for a wild, bumpy ride...
[10:27] <kevor> What the.. updating to Dapper requires 700mb of files@!$!@
[10:27] <Healot> dewbie, just read the readme text :)
[10:27] <kevor> what is up with that?
[10:27] <octan> Xyloc, if can lose all data anyway
[10:27] <dewbie> there is an imake folder withing te config folder
[10:27] <octan> *he
[10:27] <drumline> dewbie: there might even be an INSTALL.TXT
[10:27] <Healot> try to follow that first... if any error then tell them
[10:27] <octan> distanceisdeath partiton magic is not 100% safe
[10:27] <alth> spikeb, what do you mean RC?
[10:27] <drumline> anyway... time for bed.   niter folks
[10:28] <spikeb> alth: release candidate
[10:28] <alth> spikeb:  ah, what's the difference?
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> octan
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> i resized it
[10:28] <dewbie> lmao
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> and
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> i wanna quit it
[10:28] <dewbie> the readme for it is for xorg 6
[10:28] <dewbie> not for the actual file
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> but it asks me if i want to apply or not???
[10:28] <dewbie> wtf
[10:28] <octan> you need to reboot.. then the stuff start to happen
[10:28] <spikeb> alth: release candidate means it's almost ready
[10:28] <Xyloc_> Richiefrinch, how do i pastebin a file into XChat?
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> reboot?
[10:28] <distanceisdeath> like i quit
[10:29] <octan> yes..
[10:29] <distanceisdeath> partitionmagic
[10:29] <octan> as in powerdown
[10:29] <distanceisdeath> and apply the changes?
[10:29] <octan> after you applyed
[10:29] <distanceisdeath> and then restart
[10:29] <distanceisdeath> okay
[10:29] <alth> spikeb:  Ah, ok. So should I upgrade? :P
[10:29] <spikeb> alth: if you feel brave, yes :)
[10:29] <octan> distanceisdeath it may take some houers before its finished :P

[10:36] <Xyloc_> I use Liunux since 1996, but I'm a bit new to chatting, sorry guys
[10:36] <Xyloc_> and gals...
[10:36] <ubuntu> cfsk or cfdisk?
[10:37] <distanceisdeath> all right octan
[10:37] <Healot> Xyloc_: really?
[10:38] <distanceisdeath> now what octan?
[10:38] <octan> open partiton magic again again.
[10:38] <distanceisdeath> okay
[10:39] <octan> but as i told you.. partiton magic is not 100 % safe
[10:39] <tmroland> yupee
[10:39] <tmroland> just installed ubuntu
[10:39] <Xyloc_> richiefrich, pasting....
[10:39] <tmroland> running 5.10 on powerpc64 smp
[10:39] <tmroland> :)
[10:39] <distanceisdeath> keep going
[10:39] <distanceisdeath> its open
[10:39] <GnarusLeo> !java
[10:39] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[10:39] <tmroland> i love this OS
[10:39] <octan> distanceisdeath resizing partitons are not 100% safe,, and never will be
[10:39] <distanceisdeath> i understand
[10:39] <distanceisdeath> but right now
[10:40] <Healot> tmroland: distro :)
[10:40] <distanceisdeath> my computer is half broken...
[10:40] <tmroland> yea i hate yellow dog linux or other distros.. all i like is ubuntu.. clean, lightweight and rock-solid
[10:40] <twopeak> is there a decent way to brows the network?
[10:40] <octan> what did part magic say
[10:40] <Xyloc_> distanceisdeath: so you live up to your nick ;-)
[10:40] <tmroland> finally a good distro for my dual cpu powermac
[10:40] <octan> Xyloc_ LOL
[10:40] <Healot> tmroland: you're using the SMP kernel?
[10:41] <tmroland> smp and 64 bit
[10:41] <tmroland> yes
[10:41] <octan> <distanceisdeath> what did part magic say about the sizes?
[10:41] <Xyloc_> 800x600 sucks...
[10:41] <Healot> how does it feel?
[10:41] <distanceisdeath> octan it looks like i jsut opened to it before i did any partitioning
[10:41] <richiefrich> Xyloc_ ok
[10:41] <tmroland> very fast and stable so far :)
[10:41] <Healot> just like, MacOS X *BSD kernel? tmroland
[10:41] <xerophyte> is there anything like Fedora Directory server for Ubuntu ???
[10:41] <Xyloc_> richiefrich, thx forthe pointers...
[10:41] <tmroland> macosx doesnt have a bsd kernel.. its a mix of mach and some bsd code is handling networking and file management
[10:42] <tmroland> i mean fs
[10:42] <distanceisdeath> they are the same
[10:42] <spikeb> osx's kernel is a POS
[10:42] <richiefrich> Xyloc_  np
[10:42] <distanceisdeath> the way i had them before
[10:42] <spikeb> hope they clean it up now that avie is gone
[10:42] <tmroland> see ya later guys ill come back with questions soon
[10:42] <octan> distanceisdeath try cheage em now in safe mode
[10:42] <tmroland> so far so good the distro rocks
[10:42] <distanceisdeath> resize again?
[10:42] <octan> yes
[10:42] <distanceisdeath> okat
[10:42] <distanceisdeath> okay*
[10:43] <octan> i have used pm8 3 time.. 1 time i had to reformat the hole drive
[10:43] <distanceisdeath> okay octan
[10:43] <Xyloc_> distanceisdeath: did you apply the changes yert>
[10:43] <distanceisdeath> aply?
[10:43] <distanceisdeath> one sec
[10:43] <shriphani> i got a problem
[10:43] <Xyloc_> yert = yet
[10:43] <dog> i have tryed to install my nvidia card but i cant get it 2 work does some one have a guied?
[10:44] <shriphani> wine refuses to install
[10:44] <spikeb> !tell dog about nvidia
[10:44] <distanceisdeath> yeah i applied
[10:44] <octan> distanceisdeath then restart
[10:44] <shriphani> anyone ?
[10:44] <Xyloc_> dog: Oh, boy, nVidia supplies binary drivers for linux
[10:44] <Xyloc_> dog: You're the lucky one, I'm stuck with an S3
[10:44] <shriphani> i installed wine but it doesnt run
[10:45] <Xyloc_> shriphani, what errs do you get?
[10:45] <shriphani> just a sec
[10:45] <octan> dog i have a nothher way to do it.... dont use the drivers in the repo. if you want proper libGL drivers
[10:45] <octan> *another
[10:45] <octan> get the nvidia bin pkg
[10:45] <shriphani> wine: could not load L"c:\\windows\\system32\\PATH.exe": Module not found
[10:45] <achandra> Sorry to ask again..is gcc-3.4 in the main source or?
[10:45] <Xyloc_> dog: Use the drivers from the nVidia website
[10:45] <distanceisdeath> octan: it took me to the log on screen
[10:46] <distanceisdeath> log in?
[10:46] <octan> just reboot
[10:46] <distanceisdeath> i did reboot
[10:46] <Xyloc_> shriphani: what version of wine did you install?
[10:46] <distanceisdeath> and it went through the xp logo screen and now to the log in
[10:46] <shriphani> i used the apt-get
[10:46] <Xyloc_> shriphani: good...
[10:46] <shriphani> ok
[10:46] <shriphani> but why doesnt it run
[10:47] <Xyloc_> shriphani: What program are you trying to run through wine?
[10:47] <octan> distanceisdeath you must powerdown and up | reboor. force it if it will not do it
[10:47] <shriphani> nothing
[10:47] <distanceisdeath> okay
[10:47] <shriphani> i just wanted to run it first
[10:47] <spikeb> you can't
[10:48] <shriphani> i cant ?
[10:48] <spikeb> wine doesn't actually run itself, it runs other programs
[10:48] <Xyloc_> spike: right on
[10:48] <shriphani> ok so i put in the cd and then type wine PATH ?
[10:48] <alth> !tell alth about dapper
[10:48] <Xyloc_> shriphani, no.
[10:48] <shriphani> then ?
[10:48] <distanceisdeath> octan...its doing the same exact thing
[10:48] <manuvcube> octan: neither "mail" from the gnu mailutils nor evolution show any mails for root. The trouble is, that the mail is delivered over a relay host to root@mycomputername.tld.
[10:48] <distanceisdeath> going to the logo scren
[10:48] <distanceisdeath> screen*
[10:49] <Xyloc_> shriphani: type wine path.exe instead (when in the same path as path.exe)
[10:49] <manuvcube> octan: the relay host cant deliver to mycomputername.tld, because there's no smtp server running
[10:49] <shriphani> ok
[10:49] <shriphani> after i put in the cd ?
[10:49] <Xyloc_> From your Desk, you can use Alt+F2
[10:49] <shriphani> and ?
[10:49] <distanceisdeath> octan im at logon again
[10:49] <octan> <distanceisdeath> hmm.. odd
[10:49] <Xyloc_> shriphani: you first have to mount the CD and change to the proper directory
[10:49] <dee_> hello.
[10:50] <distanceisdeath> now what?
[10:50] <shriphani> ok
[10:50] <shriphani> the dir of my cd ?
[10:50] <dee_> is it possible to restore files deleted by "rm" on ext3-filesystem?
[10:50] <Xyloc_> shrip: yes...
[10:50] <shriphani> i.e. /mount/cdrom ?
[10:50] <manuvcube> octan: and postfix has mycomputername.tld as a "mydomain" entry in main.cf
[10:50] <octan> distanceisdeath you must have missed something in parition magic
[10:50] <manuvcube> octan: but stil tries to deliver that mail via the relay host
[10:50] <Healot> yes... there are tools for that... dee_
[10:50] <Xyloc_> shrip: or media/cdrom, yes, you can choose your own mount point
[10:50] <octan> manuvcube you missconfigured postfix
[10:50] <shriphani> ok
[10:51] <Xyloc_> shrip: Just mount it as vfat
[10:51] <distanceisdeath> i right clicked the c drive...resize.....changed the free space to 10000 megs...applied
[10:51] <shriphani> and then i type wine path.exe ?
[10:51] <distanceisdeath> and turned off
[10:51] <manuvcube> octan: blame me ;-)
[10:51] <octan> lol
[10:51] <manuvcube> octan: I didn't even know, I configured it :-)
[10:51] <babo> I can't seem to burn an iso to my cdrom ... ? it seems to run fine, when I put in a blank cd I get 'blank cd' on the gnome desktop. But when I fire up gnome it just asks me to Please insert a disk into the HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-4167B  ... then says ... umount: /media/cdrom0: not mounted?
[10:51] <Xyloc_> shriphani: First you need to change to the same dir that path.exe is in.
[10:51] <shriphani> hmm
[10:52] <babo> root@ubuntu64:~# ln -s /dev/cdrom /dev/cdrom0
[10:52] <babo> root@ubuntu64:~# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom0 /media/cdrom0
[10:52] <babo> mount: block device /dev/cdrom0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
[10:52] <octan> manuvcube do you got webmin? its a great tool to comfigure postfix
[10:52] <shriphani> i.e. the installation file ?
[10:52] <manuvcube> octan: how do I teach postfix to deliver mails without a domain portion locally?
[10:52] <Healot> babo: try to reinsert that blank
[10:52] <octan> manuvcube> you need to set that the root mail are delivered localy
[10:52] <richiefrich> babo what are u trying ?
[10:52] <Xyloc_> shrip: well if the installation file is in the smae directory as your pwd, go right ahead...
[10:52] <Xyloc_> smae = same
[10:52] <babo> I want to burn an iso of dapper ... ?
[10:53] <Xyloc_> babo, wait until Juhne 1st
[10:53] <richiefrich> babo  ok but it's mounted
[10:53] <manuvcube> octan: webmin? Ok, I'll try that, even if it known to have (or had) some serious security flwas
[10:53] <manuvcube> octan: bbl
[10:53] <babo> richiefrich, gnomebaker gone all weird since I rm'd /home ... ;-)
[10:53] <shriphani> if the exe is brb.exe should i still type brb.exe or path.exe ?
[10:53] <Healot> babo: pre order the CD now :)
[10:53] <richiefrich> babo  <babo> mount: block device /dev/cdrom0 is write-protected, mounting read-only    <--- means it mounted
[10:53] <babo> Xyloc: why ?
[10:53] <distanceisdeath> octan...what to do?
[10:53] <Xyloc_> babo: that's the proper release date of Dapper
[10:53] <richiefrich> babo   burn it from the CLI with cdrecord
[10:54] <richiefrich> babo or use growisofs
[10:54] <babo> Xyloc_: unconcerned...my os needs a reinstall and I'm sick of 64bit...
[10:54] <Xyloc_> richiefrich: Did you see anything unusual in my xorg.conf file?
[10:54] <octan> distanceisdeath i wish i knew... i think you habe been doing it wrong.. distanceisdeath check and see if partition magic is set to start at bootup
[10:54] <shriphani> Xyloc, should i type the exact exe name or only path.exe ?
[10:54] <richiefrich> Xyloc_ whats the link i missed when u pasted it
[10:54] <octan> <distanceisdeath> start --> run --msconfig
[10:55] <babo> richiefrich: well, it's not that I don't enjoy hd scsi commands, but I was hoping to avoid them on this occasion ;-)
[10:55] <distanceisdeath> its not
[10:55] <GnarusLeo> How do I install java virtual machine?
[10:55] <distanceisdeath> okay

[11:02] <Terminus> laughlin: you're welcome. nice! welcome to the world of almost no compiling. hehe
[11:02] <octan> distanceisdeath yes.. thats the hard way..
[11:03] <distanceisdeath> whats the easy way?
[11:03] <distanceisdeath> open a cmd
[11:03] <distanceisdeath> $path
[11:03] <Xyloc_> Is Synaptic still buggy in Dapper?
[11:03] <octan> link pm to startmenu --> startup
[11:03] <laughlin> now its time to build in all those packages i need/want! yay
[11:03] <Xyloc_> apt-get from the CLI works much better.
[11:03] <distanceisdeath> i dont know how to do that man
[11:03] <octan> distanceisdeath, thats the easy way
[11:03] <GnarusLeo> What do I need to install to get Java Virtual Machine? I have the sun-j2re packages!
[11:03] <distanceisdeath> is this command line or drag and drop?
[11:03] <richiefrich> Xyloc  u dont have too try to change line 88  to          DefaultDepth    24
[11:04] <Xyloc_> distance: just type [Win+R] , then cmd [Enter] 
[11:04] <distanceisdeath> i know that
[11:04] <distanceisdeath> i dont know how to set the path
[11:04] <octan> distanceisdeath, ocuments and Settings/All Users/Start-meny/Programmer/oppstart
[11:04] <richiefrich> Xyloc  if not then try to change the         Driver    "savage"   and use vesa or something compatible
[11:04] <Xyloc_> distance: Why do you want to alter the path?
[11:04] <octan> distanceisdeath, look there
[11:05] <distanceisdeath> i need partition magic to start up on start
[11:05] <distanceisdeath> okay octan
[11:05] <distanceisdeath> then how do i link it
[11:05] <octan> OMFG..
[11:05] <Xyloc> richiefrich: Vesa will slow it down to a Slug sliding upwards through nails
[11:05] <octan> <distanceisdeath> open the dir where pm is and drag it to dockument and setings bla bla bla
[11:06] <ubuntu> hi
[11:06] <ubuntu> hi

[11:06] <Xyloc> richiefrich: Waht do you mean with idk?

[11:17] <Xyloc> dewbie: I know it's crap, but I won't but another laptop, just because the VHGA is crappy
[11:17] <dewbie> this Im on now is a laptop
[11:17] <Xyloc> dewbie, thanks for the tip, I'll try it!
[11:17] <richiefrich> Xyloc i'd still try the nvidia one cause look here http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=66551
[11:18] <dewbie> I can't get the tgz to compile
[11:18] <dewbie> ive already untarred it
[11:19] <dewbie> just need to install it
[11:19] <dewbie> its not working well
[11:19] <octan> dewbie ./configure & make & sudo make install
[11:19] <Xyloc> dewbie: Did you try ./configure first?
[11:19] <dewbie> yes
[11:19] <Xyloc> octan: :-)
[11:19] <dewbie> tells me there is n such file
[11:19] <octan> what file?
[11:20] <octan> configure?
[11:20] <dewbie> even from within the folder in which the driver resides
[11:20] <Xyloc> octan: I think it's twice the &&
[11:20] <octan> did you read the README & INSTALL file
[11:20] <octan> ops sorry,,, yes its &&
[11:20] <Xyloc> ;-)
[11:20] <dewbie> the readme is for xorg... useless
[11:20] <enkrav> I did "share this folder" to a folder of mine, wrote localhost as the host and used NFS. How are users supposed to access this shared folder?
[11:20] <dewbie> ./configure doesn't work
=== Eden is now known as Eden_AFK
[11:21] <Xyloc> I really liked the chat Guys, now I'm going to the shop for a me upgrade...
[11:21] <Xyloc> me= mem
[11:21] <Xyloc> 128MB -> 512 MB
[11:21] <octan> me did that,, got 2GB now :)
[11:21] <dewbie> this is what it tells me in bash : bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
[11:21] <Xyloc> That should rock my old P /// 600!
[11:22] <octan> lol
[11:22] <Xyloc> dewbie: So there's no configure?
[11:22] <Sub> dewbie, not all source tars have a ./configure. do "make" and tell me if u get any errors
[11:22] <octan> yes,, 100% improment
[11:22] <Xyloc> octan: at the very least
[11:22] <octan> <Xyloc> i didnt follow form the start,, but what are you trying to install
[11:23] <dewbie> make[1] : xmakefile: No such file or directory
[11:23] <dewbie> make[1] : *** No rule to make target `xmakefile'.  Stop.

[11:23] <zcat[1] > what is dewbie compiling?
[11:23] <octan> erm dewbie

[11:24] <zcat[1] > ahh. ok
[11:24] <twopeak> i'd like to make a shell script to unmount my drives, but I need to isue the command with sudo. How do I go around to have the password in the script?
[11:24] <Xyloc> richie: Thanks, I'll copy your line to a text file...
[11:24] <dewbie> for breezy
[11:24] <Sub> twopeak, you can make the shellscript run as root
[11:24] <Sub> !setuid
[11:24] <ubotu> What? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Sub
[11:24] <Sub> hmm
[11:25] <richiefrich> Xyloc  those will be the 1st things i'd do keep the drive "savage"  for now
[11:25] <dewbie> nothing seems to work
[11:25] <richiefrich> Xyloc i think your card is maxing out of mem
[11:25] <twopeak> Sub how do I do this?
[11:25] <Sub> twopeak, you need to setuid as root on the shellscript, google "setuid", its bad security practice though.
[11:25] <zcat[1] > never setuid shell scripts.. it's one of the oldest security issues!!
[11:25] <Sub> i've never done it so i dont kno myself im aftrad
[11:25] <twopeak> Sub thanks.
[11:25] <Xyloc> richiefrich, it does work under win9x
[11:25] <Xyloc> With full color depth

[11:32] <ubotu> gnaleo: Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[11:32] <dewbie> windows HATES being after something else
[11:32] <Stefansoft> hoi
[11:32] <Taru> I am planning on re-installing ubuntu to set the partition big enough for windows.
[11:32] <dewbie> install it FIRST
[11:32] <dewbie> then
[11:32] <Taru> install windows first?
[11:32] <dewbie> install ubuntu
[11:33] <Taru> ok
[11:33] <dewbie> yeah
[11:33] <admiral_proFTW> windows first
[11:33] <Taru> do i need partition magic installed on windows ?
[11:33] <admiral_proFTW> it'll overwrite the MBR otherwise
[11:33] <Taru> ok
[11:33] <dewbie> windows will overwrite the MBR
[11:33] <Terminus> dewbie: well, just trying to be helpful. i don't exactly keep my irc window open and a lot of people don't either. we just wait for the icon to blink. :)
[11:33] <enyc> you can recover from this using Knoppix or semithng... it can just be a fiddle...
[11:33] <dewbie> taru no
[11:33] <enyc> and then you have te sotup the windows chain-boot
[11:33] <enyc> to make that work...
[11:33] <Taru> dewbie, well i want 20 gigs for windows and rest for ubuntu
[11:34] <dewbie> just install windows and then ubuntu will take care of the rest
[11:34] <St_Iron> hello
[11:34] <enyc> St_Iron: mee_do_moop
[11:34] <Kakurady> So it's not possible to boot Ubuntu from the Windows loader?
[11:34] <admiral_proFTW> taru: what do you have on your HD now. how are they partitioned
[11:34] <Taru> dewbie, i have 80 gigs total
[11:34] <dewbie> I have 160
[11:34] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, i just have ubuntu in HD
[11:34] <dewbie> no problem
[11:34] <Terminus> Taru: you don't need partitionmagic if you limit the size of the windows partition when installing it. :)
[11:34] <Taru> Terminus, ok
[11:34] <dewbie> lol
[11:34] <enyc> Kakurady: you con sortof... by adding win32-grub and adding boot etries etc. but it makes life all needlessly complicated...
[11:34] <dewbie> terminus is correct
[11:34] <Taru> ok thanks guys/gals^^
[11:34] <spikeb> i love my mac mini, i plan on getting a new one or an intel imac eventually
[11:35] <Taru> going to try this now
[11:35] <Kakurady> Well if it is possible it is exciting enough for me.
[11:35] <dewbie> uh oh
[11:35] <Taru> just install over ubuntu?
[11:35] <admiral_proFTW> no
[11:35] <enyc> Kakurady: you may-as-well just install win32 first then install ubunt u and the needed boot envirenment will all be-there
[11:35] <dewbie> yes
[11:35] <Taru> and sometime it will let me choose how ot manage the partition?
[11:35] <dewbie> windows needs to be first
[11:35] <Kakurady> That's what I have now, enyc.
[11:35] <Taru> im on ubuntu atm
[11:35] <Taru> so what i do?
[11:35] <dewbie> it will be pisse otherwise
[11:35] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: do you have free space
[11:36] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, 3 gigs of unused space
[11:36] <Terminus> Kakurady: if you really want to use the windows bootloader, you're gonna have to image the boot sector for ubuntu.
[11:36] <dewbie> windows will over write the MBR anyway
[11:36] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: no i mean unformated space
[11:36] <dewbie> just reinstall both
[11:36] <Kakurady> The problem is, I've got an ATI X1800 and the free drivers provided by breezy won't work.
[11:36] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, not sure
[11:36] <spikeb> and yes, i run ubuntu on my macintoshes
[11:36] <spikeb> !tell Kakurady about ati
[11:36] <admiral_proFTW> run "sudo fdisk -ls"
[11:36] <Taru> k
[11:36] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: and tell us what it says
[11:36] <Kakurady> I knew that, ... but I haven't tried yet.
[11:37] <spikeb> oh
[11:37] <spikeb> Kakurady: try it :)
[11:37] <dewbie> I still can't get shit working
[11:37] <dewbie> god I hate term windows to chat in
[11:37] <admiral_proFTW> dewbie: whats the problem?

[11:38] <topher> hi, um, can anyone tell me how to install openssh on ubuntu?
[11:38] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, http://linux.pastebin.com/738918
[11:38] <Besso> HI DO SOMEONE KNOW HOW TO INSTALL ACROBAT READER ON UBUNTU 64 BIT
[11:38] <Kakurady> I couldn't do as documented, anyway, since there's something wrong with my PPPoE internet connection and I'll have to download the packages in Windows and install them using dpkg.
[11:38] <dewbie> I can't get my intel video driver installed
[11:38] <topher> or send me to a website with instrusctions that are easy to follow
[11:38] <Terminus> laughlin: what exactly did you type?
[11:38] <dewbie> goddamn besso
[11:38] <dewbie> stop yelling
[11:38] <spikeb> Besso: i don't think there is a 64bit version of acrobat reader
[11:39] <albinoloverats> Is there a way to bring a window to the front, using the terminal?
[11:39] <Kakurady> sudo apt-get openssh-client , then sudo apt-install openssh-client?
[11:39] <spikeb> sudo apt-get install
[11:39] <Kakurady> Hmm.
[11:39] <dewbie> can I get a vote : sudo aye or nay?
[11:39] <admiral_proFTW> taru: can you run gparted and take a screenshot
[11:39] <spikeb> dewbie: sudo aye
[11:39] <Kakurady> Sudo Yeah!
[11:39] <admiral_proFTW> taru:i forget how to read these things
[11:39] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[11:40] <Terminus> dewbie: aye!
[11:40] <apokryphos> dewbie: sudo is the superior model
[11:40] <laughlin> Terminux: apt-cache search kismet;;;;;;;;;;; but it doesn't give me what i'm looking for
[11:40] <Kakurady> What's the alternative, then?
[11:40] <laughlin> Terminus: it gives me nothing
[11:40] <apokryphos> Kakurady: conventional root model
[11:40] <Terminus> laughlin: what's with the semicolons?
[11:40] <apokryphos> with only su
[11:40] <spikeb> even OSX uses something very similar to the sudo model
[11:40] <spikeb> :)
[11:40] <dewbie> versus su... password...wait... wrong pass... try again .... hmmm sudo rocks
[11:40] <dewbie> lol
[11:40] <Kakurady> Oh. I've never used Unix-like systems before ubuntu.
[11:41] <topher> it okay, i will try that.  thank you.
[11:41] <Xyloc> Thx 4 the talk guys, I'm going to have luch and after that I'll buy my mem upgrade....
[11:41] <Kakurady> Microsoft lover all the time.
[11:41] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, how do you take pic?
[11:41] <apokryphos> dewbie: not just because of that. Sudo is an awful lot more flexible; it'd be very hard to hold up any argument for it not being superior.
[11:41] <laughlin> to seperate my command from a statement to you...
[11:41] <laughlin> hehe
[11:41] <spikeb> if you actually like MS's products, why are you trying ubuntu, Kakurady?
[11:41] <Terminus> laughlin: apt-cache shows me kismet here. and kismet is available in the universe repo. like i suggested to you earlier, enable the universe and multiverse repos.
[11:41] <java_dev> how can i setup a name server something like ns1.something.com and ns2.something.com?
[11:41] <Kakurady> Because it's way too cool compared to Windows.
[11:41] <Terminus> ubotu: tell laughlin about repositories
[11:41] <dewbie> Im lazy and its easy to type waht could be better?
[11:41] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: Ksnapshot. Kmenu --Graphics --Screen capture
[11:42] <spikeb> haha Kakurady
[11:42] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, thanks
[11:42] <laughlin> Terminus: shit that's right i forgot
[11:42] <dewbie> coming from FreeBSD...
[11:42] <admiral_proFTW> ah
[11:42] <Kakurady> spikeb:And I'm using free software even before I used Linux, see...
[11:42] <spikeb> Kakurady: ah, that makes sense
[11:42] <dewbie> ok who has gnome and who has kde?
[11:42] <Kakurady> like, GIMP.
[11:42] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: it might not be Ksnapshot, i forget this ubuntu
[11:42] <dewbie> gnome
[11:42] <spikeb> dewbie: gnome
[11:42] <admiral_proFTW> kde
[11:42] <Terminus> dewbie: you can still use su - without a root password if you really want to. :)
[11:42] <N1GH4> gnome
[11:42] <unix_infidel> hey guys, quick question, does ubuntu ship with a dynamic association script with its wireless config
[11:42] <unix_infidel> eg with iwconfig
[11:43] <apokryphos> dewbie: #ubuntu-offtopic for general chatter, please :)

[11:44] <neo_> bye everyone
[11:44] <neo_> quit
[11:44] <apokryphos> Besso: drop the caps, please.
[11:45] <unix_infidel> sorry, about that.

[11:45] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[11:45] <dewbie> so how do I compile something that won't compile?
[11:45] <VoX> besso: yes you can, but you need to use a 32bit chroot
[11:45] <MistaED> mortal`: you mean the normal 'ubuntu' login screen or is there a new updated dapper one?
[11:45] <Mortal`> MistaED, normal one
[11:45] <Mortal`> Kakurady, hehe, sure, I thought of doing that if I couldn't find another way :)
[11:45] <Besso> do you have som guide to it?
[11:45] <unix_infidel> when i get my device up it automatically associates to the closest AP
[11:46] <unix_infidel> i'm wondering what does ubuntu use? is it using a custom dynamic assocation script?
[11:46] <Kakurady> Well you can compile one from the source images using GIMP ^_^
[11:46] <dewbie> still waiting,,,
[11:46] <dewbie> :(
[11:46] <Mortal`> Kakurady, do you know where the source images are? :o
[11:46] <dewbie> Ive tried ./configure
[11:46] <dewbie> ./make
[11:46] <dewbie> and ./imake
[11:46] <MistaED> mortal`: i guess you could mock-up one from the data it uses to make it, like from system > admin > login window *shurgs*
[11:46] <Kakurady> No. I'm no experienced than you in using linux-based systems;
[11:46] <dewbie> nothing works
[11:46] <unix_infidel> anyone on my wireless assocation script quesiton?
[11:47] <admiral_proFTW> dewie: what are you compiling?
[11:47] <Kakurady> I'm used to Windows.
[11:47] <Kakurady> And I can't get X working.
[11:47] <pio> oui
[11:47] <VoX> Besso: have a look on the ubuntu forums
[11:47] <Mortal`> MistaED, do you know where those themes are hidden, and in which format?
[11:47] <MistaED> although whenever i pick it, it instantly closes under dapper o.O bug
[11:47] <pio> cm va tu?
[11:47] <apokryphos> Kakurady: what's the problem?
[11:47] <dewbie> intel 945GM PCI Express video
[11:47] <VoX> Besso: there's a few guides on there
[11:47] <apokryphos> !fr
[11:47] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[11:47] <Terminus> dewbie: you can't just bash on something and expect it to work. read and understand the documentation. :)
[11:47] <admiral_proFTW> what is that?
[11:47] <MistaED> mortal`: i'm guessing /usr/share/gdm
[11:47] <pio> allo
[11:47] <Kakurady> Can't install ATi's prop******(can't spell it) drivers.
[11:48] <dewbie> geesus
[11:48] <Terminus> Kakurady: proprietary. :)
[11:48] <apokryphos> Kakurady: are you following the guide?
[11:48] <dewbie> Im kind of in a hurry
[11:48] <Kakurady> Thanks, Terminus.
[11:48] <admiral_proFTW> Kakurady: propriety*
[11:48] <Kakurady> I was following the readme instead...
[11:48] <dewbie> whats the man page for configureing then
[11:48] <apokryphos> Kakurady: /msg ubotu ati
[11:48] <Mortal`> MistaED, sweet! I'll start Gimp rightaway :D thanks a lot!
[11:48] <Kakurady> Not needed.
[11:48] <Terminus> dewbie: not reading the docs and trying to build something takes a lot longer.
[11:48] <admiral_proFTW> dewbie: read the install file
[11:49] <MistaED> mortal`: np, or you could just yoink one from osdir.com ;)
[11:49] <unix_infidel> anyone for my dynamic assocation question...whenever i get my wireless device up it automaticlaly associates to the closest unencrypted wireless AP, how does it do that....
[11:49] <Terminus> dewbie: there's no manpage. the developer usually provides documentation on how to build stuff.
[11:49] <dewbie> if you read it you will see what I am still here for
[11:49] <unix_infidel> someone mentioned /etc/network/interfaces
[11:49] <Terminus> dewbie: URL for the source?
[11:49] <Kakurady> I guess I didn't understand the guide at first. I couldn't use apt-get because I didn't have PPPoE configured.
[11:49] <Mortal`> Oh yea, another question: How do I start an application from Terminal without having it hook the Terminal screen?
[11:49] <auser> Mortal`: add a & at the end
[11:49] <Mortal`> auser, thanks
[11:49] <laughlin> Terminus: another question: i just edited  my /boot/config-2.6.12-9-386 and set CONFIG_SMP=y, is that all i need to do to enable SMP, as i noticed that by default it was disabled
[11:50] <Kakurady> And I can't get it configured w/o luck.
[11:50] <Sub> Mortal`, Alt_F2 and clcik "run from terminal2
[11:50] <Mortal`> Sub, I meant the opposite, which can be achieved by adding a & at the end in Terminal (as auser just told me)
[11:51] <auser> Hello folks anybody here who'd be willing to help with a "X" Problem?
[11:51] <Sub> oh you mean run it seperateof the terminal? i thought u meant run it without opening a terminal first :D
[11:51] <Sub> auser, what kind of problem?
[11:51] <Sub> I may be able to help
[11:51] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, http://s53.photobucket.com/albums/g42/momo87_photos/?action=view&current=Screenshot.png
[11:51] <Terminus> laughlin: ummm... i'm not sure. i haven't had to compile a kernel in a long time. are you running breezy or dapper?
[11:51] <auser> Sub: X starts, but all i get is a Blank screen..
[11:51] <dibblego> I just switched my Ubuntu machine from wireless to ethernet and now the network is extremely slow, any ideas why?
[11:51] <laughlin> 5.10
[11:51] <SS2> hi, I have problems on downloading the latest ubuntu rc with bittorrent, error: rejected by the tracker <-- why that?
[11:51] <Sub> auser, you dont get any X errors?
[11:52] <Kakurady> Why I can't copy files to my other partition as a user?
[11:52] <auser> Sub: no sadly no errors and only some WW in the log
[11:52] <Kakurady> drwxr-xr-x  13 root root 8192 2006-05-26 17:07 sda2
[11:52] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: err click on hda no sda
[11:52] <admiral_proFTW> not*
[11:52] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[11:52] <Terminus> laughlin: hmmm... not sure if the server kernels are in breezy. i think those have SMP support. try searching for linux-image-server.
[11:52] <Sub> auser, and your monitor is confgiurred correctly in /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
=== pio is now known as fatima
[11:52] <admiral_proFTW> auser: run it in fail safe terminal
[11:52] <SS2> nobody that uses the torrent of ubuntu to geht the iso?
[11:52] <dewbie> good god
[11:53] <Sub> auser, cuz the wrong horiz/vert sync or resolution can cause blank screen
[11:53] <dewbie> wtf am I worried about, it doesn't support my resolution anyway
[11:53] <auser> Sub: yea i belive so, in as much as it's a generic monitor, that does only 3 different resolutions..
[11:53] <admiral_proFTW> asuer: or the wrong drivers
[11:53] <dewbie> 1440x900 is native 1280x1024 is their max
[11:54] <auser> Sub: any suggestions for "known to work with anything" (640x480)?
[11:54] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, http://s53.photobucket.com/albums/g42/momo87_photos/?action=view&current=Screenshot-1.png
[11:54] <fatima> oui
[11:54] <Sub> auser, what gfx card u got? Nvidia?
[11:55] <auser> Sub: naw integrated i830m card (uses i810 driver)
[11:55] <Sub> ahh, was gonna say fall back to the nv driver, sometimes fixes things for me
[11:55] <richiefrich> auser do u have modlines in your xorg.conf
[11:56] <auser> Sub: funny thing is it was working beautifully befor i installed a dapper beta
[11:56] <cA1mAn> how to have copied (ctrl+c) things STAYING in the clipboard, even when closing the app where it was copied from?
[11:56] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: your HD isn't registeing
[11:56] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, :O
[11:56] <admiral_proFTW> auser: your card
[11:56] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, What do I do now?
[11:56] <richiefrich> auser  whats in your xorg.conf would u pastebin that
[11:56] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: let me reserach
[11:56] <auser> admiral_proFTW: i830m
[11:56] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[11:57] <H0lyD4wg> how do i keep mounted partitions from appearing on the desktop?
[11:57] <auser> richiefrich: i cant at the moment as i'm in "single user"
[11:57] <richiefrich> auser  whats that mean
[11:57] <richiefrich> auser  goto pastebin.ca uload the file
[11:58] <auser> richiefrich: simple: if you boot in "recoverymode" you only get one terminal (in which i'm typing now) and cant swith with Alt+Fx..
[11:58] <Sub> richiefrich, hes in a shell, not X
[11:58] <auser> richiefrich: will do, join u later,
[11:58] <richiefrich> Sub so
[11:58] <auser> Sub: correct!
[11:58] <richiefrich> Sub links
[11:58] <admiral_proFTW> can someone read this: http://linux.pastebin.com/738918
[11:58] <Sub> richiefrich, how can he copy paste?
[11:58] <admiral_proFTW> how bit is hda1
[11:59] <richiefrich> sub use links
[11:59] <admiral_proFTW> NWM
[11:59] <Sub> richiefrich, i kno what links is
[11:59] <admiral_proFTW> Taru:your entire Hd is one partition
[11:59] <richiefrich> Sub use links   goto  patebinbin.ca
[11:59] <Sub> but u cant copy xorg and paste it into pastebin in links.
[11:59] <richiefrich> it has an UPLOAD
[11:59] <cA1mAn> how to have copied (ctrl+c) things STAYING in the clipboard, even when closing the app where it was copied from?
[11:59] <richiefrich> feature
[11:59] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, O.O
[11:59] <Sub> oh does it?
[11:59] <admiral_proFTW> do you have your files saved somewhere else or are you files only on your computer
[11:59] <richiefrich> yes'
[11:59] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, what you think should happen?
[12:00] <Sub> anyway hes gone
[12:00] <richiefrich> Sub  ppl  dont look at that page i guess :P
[12:00] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: well ideally, you save your files to an external HD (your ipod might work, not sure)
[12:01] <admiral_proFTW> and then you can reduce your partition using gparted
[12:01] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, there is nothing to save here, i just installed this fresh linux today.
[12:01] <Terminus> admiral_proFTW: around 80.4GB.
[12:02] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, i just want to be able to put 20 gigs on windows and rest to linux, and easily go between OS whenever.
[12:03] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: okay
[12:03] <admiral_proFTW> then use gparted
[12:03] <Waerner> Hi! How do I set permissions for all users to a directory?
[12:03] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[12:03] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, already there
[12:03] <Waerner>  chmod somethinghereIguess directoryname   ?
[12:03] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: to reduce your partition to a 60 gb one and create a 20 GB unallocated block
[12:04] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[12:04] <Tross> What is UTB-8? or something like that
[12:04] <njan> Waerner, what are you trying to let users do?
[12:04] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, how do i unallocate?
[12:04] <Terminus> Tross: UTF-8 is a character encoding method. it extends ascii i think.
[12:05] <Waerner> njan: Browse everything, and let them write. I have a directory which shall work as a "dump" on my local network
[12:05] <Tross> Teminus: Someone told me to "take it away" how i am suppose to do that. And should i?
[12:06] <njan> Waerner, if you want the entire world to be able to write to a directory, you can chmod -r 777 directory, which will give Owner, Group, World all read/wite/execute permission
[12:06] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: then install Xp in that partition, after that boot to an install CD
[12:06] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, it wont let me make a partition table in the big drive hmm
[12:06] <Waerner> njan: As long as they're system users?
[12:06] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, doesnt have much options
[12:06] <miweit00> hi
[12:06] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: and ue that install CD partitioner to delete the 60Gb partition and create a new one
[12:06] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, im on /dev/hdc
[12:07] <achandra> Hello.. is there a basic firewall that comes installed with ubuntu??ie even after enabling ssh it appears that i am being blocked by machine..
[12:07] <Waerner> njan: Thanks alot =)
[12:07] <phibxr> achandra, firestarter.
[12:07] <njan> Waerner, but you'd be better off doing it by group and adding all the users to a particular group and then doing 'chown -r you:yourgroup directory' and then chmod -r 775 directory, which would make it writable to yourgroup but only readable to anyone not in it
[12:07] <phibxr> achandra, or, well. i think you have to install it.
[12:07] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: link me to photobucket again please
[12:07] <Waerner> njan: thanks!
[12:07] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok
[12:07] <kbendahm> slt
[12:07] <miweit00> i have a problem: my ubuntu-installation (Dapper, beta2 amd64) stops after configuring the network.
[12:07] <phibxr> achandra, no firewall in your router or something?
[12:07] <kbendahm> alo
[12:08] <njan> achandra, what's the output of netstat -avlp |grep ssh?
[12:08] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, http://s53.photobucket.com/albums/g42/momo87_photos/?action=view&current=Screenshot-1.png
[12:08] <njan> achandra, (run using sudo, so 'sudo netstat -avlp |grep ssh')
[12:08] <achandra> yeah the local port 22 is open... but with :::22
[12:08] <achandra> that should be good right?
[12:08] <Terminus> Tross: why would you want to remove it?
[12:08] <Kakurady> If I use apt-get to install a package will it install other packages needed for the package?
[12:09] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: you should be on dev/hda
[12:09] <Tross> Terminus: Cause one i OP in a channel told me to. What happens if i do?
[12:09] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, i see hdc and sda
[12:09] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, thats it
[12:10] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: what i suggest you do is just create an installation of Xp (or whatver OS)
[12:10] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: then use partition magic to create a 60 Gb partition and install Linux there
[12:10] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok so boot xp cd
[12:10] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok cool, will do thanks
[12:10] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, be back later
[12:10] <Terminus> Tross: the OS will probably default to C. it wouldn't show funky chars in IRC if you don't have an english keyboard for example.
[12:10] <richiefrich> fdick
[12:11] <richiefrich> fdisk
[12:11] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: if you have problems, admiralprim3 on AIM
[12:11] <Doat> richiefrich, lol
[12:11] <richiefrich> Doat typo
[12:11] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ok thank you so much^^
[12:11] <Tross> Terminus: I have an Swedish keyboard. So should i do that?
[12:11] <Tross> a*
[12:11] <admiral_proFTW> np
[12:12] <Terminus> Tross: maybe you can change it to en_US.UTF-8 instead. you'll lose the swedish chars though. that's probably why the OPs in the other channel told you to remove it, coz the IRC clients can't handle unicode.
[12:12] <Terminus> *their
[12:12] <Cin> Wow! New version of Xgl. ^_____^ Just got from upgrade. Not sure how new... but it's more stable, and works *PERFECTLY* on KDE.
[12:13] <Tross> Terminus: How am I do then?
[12:14] <Tross> Terminus: Sorry for my english.
[12:14] <roman> halloo
[12:14] <Terminus> Tross: AFAIK, the env vars for that is in /etc/environment. change the values for LANGUAGE and LANG. then logout and login again.
[12:15] <Terminus> Tross: maybe there's another way to do that in gnome. not so sure though. i'm using KDE right now.
[12:15] <Terminus> Tross: should be something like keyboard or language options.
[12:15] <richiefrich> Cin i wish i could use it with e

[12:17] <Cin> Ohhh.
[12:17] <richiefrich> Flannel :)
[12:17] <Cin> richiefrich, you can't? Have you tried it?
[12:17] <kholerabbi> What do People think about Google en Ubuntu: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/31/google_goes_desktop_linux/ ???
[12:18] <richiefrich> Cin  it won't  and yes no go
[12:18] <Cin> :~(
[12:18] <richiefrich> Cin and i like e to much to install gnome or kde
[12:19] <miweit00> kholerabbi: i don't like google, i prefer ask
[12:19] <Cin> richiefrich, I wouldn't have thought you needed gnome or kde to run it.
[12:19] <Cin> richiefrich, I mean... compiz is a window manager in itself.

[12:19] <ubotu> Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[12:19] <richiefrich> Cin it only works in GNOME kde or xfce4  atm
[12:20] <richiefrich> Cin not even fluxbox
[12:20] <Cin> richiefrich, ah okay.
[12:20] <Cin> richiefrich, only a matter of time though, eh?
[12:20] <richiefrich> Cin maybe for fluxbox but not e  compiz acts as a wm and e fights it
[12:21] <richiefrich> Cin without compiz theres no point, no cool options
[12:21] <Cin> richiefrich, :-(
[12:21] <richiefrich> Cin so i screwed
[12:22] <Cin> richiefrich, I'm hoping it's stable enough to run... like... without crashing every 14 minutes like the last version. But it seems a lot better (this update I just did) with shit loads more features. If it's stable I'll run it from now on. xD
[12:23] <richiefrich> Cin nice, i have it installed but i would need to get some GNOME stuff to run it again, cause i dont use it, and i hate metacity :P
[12:23] <Cin> Hehe.
[12:27] <samuel> hello all
[12:27] <soundray> Hi samuel
[12:28] <Cin> Maybe this gets asked a lot. Will Xgl & compiz be included with the next Ubuntu version --after dapper-- if it's stable?
[12:28] <Cin> I know it's in the repos. now.
[12:28] <Flannel> Cin: you should ask in #ubuntu+1 or -offtopic
[12:28] <Cin> Flannel, will do!
[12:28] <samuel> im trying to get ubuntu 6 for amd but cant tell the difference between rc-arternate and rc-desktop, what is alternate release?
[12:29] <cA1mAn> hello, how can i make each profile/account use its smtp-server (outgoing)?
[12:31] <Cin> ohoel_, while I'm here. How do you change what version of Java is used, like to IBM or whatever?
[12:31] <Cin> Erm, ignore that ohoel_ -- I meant to say "oh".
[12:32] <Flannel> samuel: you should get the release candidate.  And, this page: http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/6.06 gives a paragraph about what the alternate CD does.  I believe that the alternate one is the old textmode installer.  But, the terminology has changed for the RC, it wasn't called that in beta.  And, for further questions, #ubuntu+1 please.
[12:32] <soundray> samuel: the alternative version has a text-mode installer. http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
[12:32] <mabus06> FTP is checked in services, and I can do "ftp mabus.sytes.net" (my ddns) and it says connected, but then when I do anything it says "not connected"
[12:33] <[lastnight] > anyone know what this file is for: /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/volatile/.mounted
[12:33] <[lastnight] > ?
[12:33] <samuel> Flannel, soundray thanks
[12:34] <[lastnight] > anyone know what this file is for: /lib/modules/2.6.12-10-386/volatile/.mounted  <- recently been created, size 0, apparently for no reason
[12:34] <[lastnight] > and out of no where
[12:34] <[lastnight] > hmmm ?
[12:35] <Terminus> mabus06: i'm guessing you either have to use IPs or setup your own named. you can't use the dns servers outside your network to resolve an ip within your network.
[12:36] <soundray> [lastnight] , I don't know for sure, but could it be just a flag to indicate that the volatile modules dir is mounted?
[12:36] <[lastnight] > thanks, i'll look into that
[12:36] <mabus06> Terminus: What? I can ssh/telnet/ping mabus.sytes.net just fine, I don't think that is the problem if I understand you right
[12:37] <jwizzman> Can anyone help me mount ntfs and sata disks?
[12:37] <Terminus> mabus06: i was assuming ddns meant dynamic dns. i guess i'm wrong. sorry.
[12:37] <VoX> jwizzman: mount </dev/device> <mount point>
[12:38] <VoX> jwizzman: for example
[12:38] <soundray> samuel, have you tried unplugging all unnecessary usb devices?
[12:38] <H080J03> k i have installed ubuntu on my computer on to a brand new hard drive, i want to boot in to windows on my old hard drive but can't becuase grub wont see the old hard drive, how do i make grub see the old hard drive?
[12:38] <VoX> jwizzman: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/example
[12:38] <mabus06> Terminus: It's dynamic dns in that, my router updates it to dyndns.com (or it might be no-ip.com, I forget) whenever my IP changes.
[12:38] <samuel> soundray, yes, no devices plugged in, not even the mouse
[12:39] <[lastnight] > soundray: thanks. -peace-
[12:39] <soundray> samuel: have you got an Intel sound device?
[12:39] <H080J03> does any one have an answer to my question?
[12:39] <Terminus> mabus06: i've got dynamic dns here too. i can't even use my external IP to access servers on my network. that's why i just use private IPs here and the hostname outside.
[12:40] <samuel> no, but a motherboard with pci maps, ga-2cewh
[12:40] <samuel> gigabyte

[01:11] <soundray> jonah: have you tried 'sudo apt-get install tellico'?
[01:11] <jonah> soundray: i got a prob with that cos i did install tellico through the add software option and the file i had to open then said my version of tellico was too old to open it - the file i originally made in suse 10 with tellico! i've since switched to ubuntu!
[01:11] <octan> soundray, executing the function within the function.. i dont think thats valid

[01:31] <Lunarctic> cool
[01:32] <soundray> jeff_: that'll take care of itself, if you haven't changed /boot/grub/menu.lst too much. Look at the installation messages - it should mention something about updating grub.
[01:33] <Lunarctic> it keeps looking at the filename as another command :/ "invalid operation thunderbird"

[01:33] <jeff_> soundray, I have dabbled in a few... :D
[01:34] <soundray> Lunarctic: you still have to tell it to "install", ie. 'sudo apt-get -d install mozilla-thunderbird'

[01:38] <House_MD> never mind i post in here
[01:38] <House_MD> but what i did was use the google translator as a us proxy, so go here: http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasa.google.com%2Flinux%2F&langpair=en%7Cfr&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools
[01:38] <jonah> soundray, are there any major issues with dapper i should know about? bugs or is it pretty cool?
[01:38] <karim> because actually apt-build downloads the developpement libraries and doesn't builds them. I don't see the point of doing that exept if the arch is "all" for this libraries

[01:43] <finbar> which version of flash
[01:43] <H080J03> 8
[01:43] <finbar> k
[01:43] <H080J03> here is how to do it
[01:43] <H080J03> flow this guid http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?versionId=3673&iTestingId=2683
[01:43] <finbar> ive got mx 2004 proffesional
[01:44] <H080J03> hmm
[01:44] <H080J03> in that case
[01:44] <l_> gnomefreak: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14668
[01:44] <laughlin> would somebody point me in the direction of a hostap ubuntu tutorial, i cant seem to find a good one
[01:46] <Terminus> l_: interesting. =D
[01:46] <gnomefreak> l_: i dont see anything that would be causing those errors
[01:46] <mabus06> soundray: there is no 'ftp' or 'proftp' or any file like that in /var/log, and greping for 'ftp' in auth.log produces nothing
[01:46] <l_> i guess it just does not want to be comiled
[01:47] <l_> gnomefreak: would it matter which compiler/version i am using?
[01:47] <House_MD> MistaED: omfg they've used wine
[01:47] <l_> gnomefreak: i used cc
[01:47] <gnomefreak> l_: is it something you wrote?
[01:47] <l_> no, something i picked up from a security site
[01:47] <H080J03> finbar, follow this guied http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/index.php?showtopic=35779 then go and find a crack for flash that replaces the flash.exe and then just run the .exe, it should work
[01:47] <soundray> mabus06: what about 'grep proftp /var/log/syslog' ?
[01:48] <H080J03> and for converting the reg file to asci just open it up in wines note pad and save it some where then import it
[01:48] <gnomefreak> i dont think so since it wasnt pre compiled for you but try gcc 3.4 or gcc 4.0 just to make sure
[01:48] <gnomefreak> let me see if i can get it to compile
[01:49] <MistaED> house_md: yeah, and it just froze and closed on me, they're too lazy to port it :(
[01:49] <finbar> k
[01:49] <MistaED> port it properly*
[01:49] <Seewai> can someone help me with english grammar? which of the following is correct: "can you send me a letter so I can wave it at whoever I need to", or "can you send me a letter, so I can wave it at whomever I need to"?
[01:49] <mabus06> soundray: nothing
[01:49] <mabus06> Seewai: What does "wave" mean in that context?
[01:49] <Terminus> gnomefreak: i think i just found a misplaced brace with that code. lines 118-121.
[01:50] <Seewai> it means show
[01:50] <l_> gnomefreak: no luck with gcc
[01:50] <Seewai> wave at ~= show to
[01:50] <l_> same errors
[01:50] <Seewai> whoever or whomever? I can never remember :)
[01:50] <H080J03> finbar, i am going to bed if it doesn't work please email me at H080J03 @t gmail d0t (com)
[01:51] <soundray> Seewai: both are correct in my opinion, but it's better with the comma.
[01:51] <House_MD> MistaED: well i have to admit its worked well for me so far, but that mixture of wine widgets and whatever else theyve used, looks nasty
[01:51] <soundray> Seewai: by the way, "to wave at" for "to show" is *very* informal.
[01:51] <Seewai> ok, thanks for your help
[01:51] <lilo_booter> Seewai: you could use 'so i can escalate the issue to the relevant personnel'
[01:52] <Terminus> l_: why is it function name, then two variable declarations before the opening brace of the function?
[01:52] <Frogzoo> ping?
[01:52] <void^> Terminus: old style declaration
[01:52] <finbar> k'
[01:52] <l_> Terminus: got me. i know very little about programming. maybe you could shed some light
[01:52] <soundray> Hi Frogzoo
[01:52] <Frogzoo> soundray: hi - bad lag
[01:52] <l_> they may be old programs. would that make a difference
[01:52] <Terminus> void^: yeah... i just realized that. stupid me. i just noticed that the parameters aren't typed.
[01:53] <spikeb> why are we talking about programming in here? heh
[01:53] <l_> where should i take my question then?
[01:53] <gnomefreak> l_: look at the lines the error gives you and match those lines with the code on the site
[01:53] <Frogzoo> l_: ##c mebbe
[01:54] <gnomefreak> rememeber thought 1 error in 1 line can cause multiple errors
[01:54] <spikeb> mind you, im not ocmplaining
[01:54] <void^> it compiles fine on freebsd btw, looks like you have a different netinet/tcp.h
[01:54] <MistaED> house_md: yeah, there's nice looking rendered fonts mixed with the clunky XP-like ones, 80mb for just picasa2 though...
[01:54] <MistaED> it looks like every port will have wine overhead with it :(
[01:55] <MistaED> (like if they port google-talk and earth)
[01:55] <Terminus> gnomefreak: my bad. it was old style function declaration, not a misplaced brace. >.<

[01:55] <spikeb> MistaED: the good news is gaim is going to have googletalk voice support some year

[01:55] <gnomefreak> Terminus: its something they way a few things were called
[01:55] <MistaED> frogzoo: 80mb for picasa though? storage overhead
[01:56] <gnomefreak> its still early here :(
[01:56] <Frogzoo> MistaED: oh, sure
[01:56] <spikeb> MistaED: photomanagement software is NOT small
[01:56] <spikeb> heh
[01:56] <nearfar> it would be nice if we can have google-notebook in epiphany
[01:56] <Terminus> gnomefreak: different headers like void^ said i guess. i didn't actually try to compile it. just wanted to read it.
[01:56] <gnomefreak> Terminus: i got same errors as he did
[01:57] <spikeb> google should port thier software using wx*
[01:57] <gnomefreak> i think the owner of code screwed up personally
[01:57] <spikeb> i can see why they used wine though - saves them from having to choose gtk/qt/etc
[01:58] <kholerabbi> Dose anyone know a tutorial that would show me the basics of building/understanding a desktop environment on linux?
[01:58] <Pyru> !tell Pyru about ndiswrapper
[01:59] <spikeb> kholerabbi: you want to build your own desktop environment/
[01:59] <neck_> that would be really interesting :)
[01:59] <Bilford> Does Google like LInux
[02:00] <markrian> After updating APT's cache of the repos, archive.ubuntu.com doesn't validate
[02:00] <MistaED> spikeb: just looked through the /opt/picasa folder, picasa itself is about 23mb, the whole thing is 75mb, so wine is 52mb added to it XD crazy
[02:00] <markrian> And doing it again doesn't fix it. No matter what, archive.ubuntu.com's update doesn't validate - what's the problem?
[02:00] <spikeb> google likes multiple platforms
[02:00] <spikeb> MistaED: it's not just wine, they have their own gecko too
[02:00] <MistaED> yeah the gecko is taking up 14mb roughly
[02:00] <kholerabbi> No, but I would like to understand some of how its done :)
[02:00] <Bilford> Google released Picase for Linux yesterday

[02:02] <vladuz976> Frogzoo: found sed 's/^/blah/g' file

[02:03] <Terminus> spikeb: weird... it shows me a 404. maybe they're filtering by geoip?
[02:03] <Frogzoo> vladuz976: yes, much better
[02:03] <Terminus> spikeb: hah, it was the first comment on /. it's available in the US only.
[02:04] <kholerabbi> I get 404 too
[02:04] <kholerabbi> Can I block my IP, so I can download it :)
[02:04] <Frogzoo> vladuz976: actually 's/^/blah/'

[02:12] <kholerabbi> Guys try: http://www.the-cloak.com/Cloaked/+cfg=32/http://picasa.google.com/linux/index.html
[02:12] <Frogzoo> zeiman: for 3D games - there's only nvidia - ATI drivers are crap
[02:12] <ArthurDentN770> could u help me? I installed dapper on my laptop, and I can do 'so root' from a terminal window
[02:13] <spikeb> !tell ArthurDentN770 about root
[02:13] <ArthurDentN770> It answer me 'Authentication failed'

=== Knighty is now known as ph84
[02:13] <Obo> i have two users in my ubuntu desktop, one who uses gnome (which has a root password) and the other who uses kde which doesn't. is it possible for the gnome user to login to kde and d/l packages for the kde user ? will all the settings set by the gnome user stick?
[02:13] <spikeb> check  your private message
[02:14] <hyphenated> Frogzoo: the ATI drivers work on my laptop. there's a bit of tearing, but I blame the card
[02:14] <spikeb> Obo: shouldnt matter what desktop the admin is using
[02:14] <zeiman> I'm working now with a GF2
[02:14] <Obo> what do you mean?
[02:14] <kholerabbi> What the? Google Picasa uses Wine? Why?!!
[02:14] <Obo> i mean, i'm the admin, if i logon to kde and change some settings.. will they last for the normal kde user?
[02:14] <spikeb> kholerabbi: easiest way for them to port it
[02:14] <hyphenated> Obo: he means it shouldn
[02:15] <spikeb> Obo: hmm
[02:15] <hyphenated> he means it shouldn't matter. ;-)
[02:15] <Frogzoo> hyphenated: yes, the ATI drivers work for 3D - but performance blows vis a vis windows - which is unacceptable IMHO
[02:15] <kholerabbi> Yeah, but wouldn't it be better in the long-run .. not to?
[02:15] <Terminus> zeiman: GF2 gives you the least headaches but i don't think it's powerful enough for newer games. just like it still can't handle newer games even under windows.
[02:15] <spikeb> Obo: if you want to install stuff, doesnt matter. if you want to change settings, it matters, those are account related
[02:15] <hyphenated> basically, packages have been installed. doing an 'update' + 'upgrade' of those packages is going to be a system-wide thing not an admin-only thing
[02:16] <vladuz976> Frogzoo: any idea how i can add to the beginning of columns in a file with fixed column width?
[02:16] <thux> Hi, in Dapper where to write modules that you don't want to load on boot?
[02:16] <Obo> ok, another question, if i logon as the kde user, which isn't admin, and i wanna install some packages, when it asks for the password, can't i use the admin password? it won't let me
[02:16] <hyphenated> Frogzoo: the et FPS were about the same on windows vs linux last time I checked
[02:16] <Jazznite> any one to tell me how open a BIN.file a new on UBUNTU sorry!!
[02:16] <Terminus> kholerabbi: one of the comments on /. was about that. wondering why they didn't just use wxwidgets etc.
[02:16] <Frogzoo> vladuz976: do your own homework ;)
[02:16] <Obo> jazznite, you don't have to open it, burn it
[02:16] <spikeb> Terminus: would have been more work
[02:16] <zeiman> terminus does cs or Wolfenstein not work?
[02:16] <Terminus> Obo: you need to add the user to your sudoers.
[02:16] <Jazznite> how??
[02:17] <Terminus> spikeb: oh...
[02:17] <Obo> oh..
[02:17] <Obo> gotcha thanx
[02:17] <Terminus> zeiman: hmmm... the old CS? should work. and i was running ET too so it's not a problem. runs fine on GF2.
[02:17] <hyphenated> Jazznite: all ".bin" files are different in their own way. if you tell us what it was you downloaded, we _might_ be able to help
[02:17] <spikeb> Terminus: they should have future-planned and written it in wxwidgets or gtk or qt to START with, i think.
[02:17] <spikeb> Terminus: the windows version included.
[02:18] <Terminus> spikeb: yeah... i thought wxwidgets would be the best solution for them though...
[02:18] <spikeb> Terminus: it would
[02:18] <Obo> <Terminus> Obo: you need to add the user to your sudoers. is it under "users and groups"?
[02:18] <spikeb> Terminus: but since they didn't plan very well, they're stuck using wine so they can be lazy
[02:18] <spikeb> yes it is Obo
[02:18] <Obo> ok thank you
[02:18] <hyphenated> wxwindows may be cross-platform, but it still sucks
[02:18] <Terminus> Obo: oh, just add the user to the admin group.
[02:18] <spikeb> it sucks less than wine
[02:19] <Jazznite> Ok is from A17 bar tk
[02:19] <hyphenated> yes, not many things suck more than wine
[02:19] <Bilford> Picasa for Linux uses Wine internally
[02:19] <Frogzoo> hyphenated: WoW in wine rocks hard core
[02:19] <hyphenated> meh. my shell scripts invoking imagemagick will win over picasa anyday ;-)
[02:19] <MistaED> the actual rendering part of picasa, it looks very smooth in rendering like it is really opengl
[02:19] <spikeb> my problem with wxwidgets is they dont seem to follow themes.
[02:20] <spikeb> MistaED: wine can render to opengl
[02:20] <Hexidigital_> i think the only thing worse than wine.... is windows
[02:20] <spikeb> MistaED: so it is :)
[02:20] <Frogzoo> wine has huge potential - if only it could get more dev lurv
[02:20] <MistaED> yeah i know it can, and very well, just i'm not sure if picasa uses it
[02:20] <hyphenated> Frogzoo: I didn't even like WoW in windows, I doubt I'd like it in wine ;-)
[02:20] <spikeb> wine has lots of dev love, it's where it is thanks to that heh
[02:20] <Frogzoo> hee hee
[02:20] <spikeb> MistaED: probably does, they did some NEAT tricks with picasa
[02:21] <Almindor> ho
[02:21] <Almindor> where do I set LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
[02:21] <Terminus> Frogzoo: i think a bigger problem than reverse engineering windows is emulating windows bugs. =D
[02:21] <Frogzoo> Almindor: it's an enviro variable - anywhere you like
[02:21] <Diiba> Hi.
[02:22] <hyphenated> Almindor: ~/.bash_profile if it's just for one user
[02:22] <Almindor> and where do I set it for all?
[02:22] <Terminus> Almindor: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$foo should work.
[02:22] <hyphenated> Almindor: the real question is "should I really change LD_LIBRARY_PATH?"
[02:22] <hyphenated> it's something you generally don't want to do
[02:22] <Healot> only in special cases
[02:22] <Frogzoo> Almindor: for all user processes? you could put 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=blah' in ~/.gnomerc
[02:23] <Jazznite> how i 'burn' a bin file, and whit what in UBUNTU the file is from A17bar.tk
[02:23] <Almindor> yes I should really change LD_LIBRARY_PATH
[02:23] <Almindor> I use alot of compiled stuff which installs info local
[02:23] <Almindor> *into
[02:23] <Frogzoo> Almindor: no - you should 'man ldconf'
[02:23] <Diiba> Btw, in xfce, with right click you open the applications menu.
[02:23] <Almindor> Frogzoo, no entry
[02:23] <Frogzoo> Almindor: no - you should 'man ldconfig'  - soz
[02:23] <Diiba> But when you use rox filer, it doesnt show it.
[02:23] <hyphenated> Almindor: not ld.so.conf instead?
[02:23] <Diiba> Anywhere.
[02:24] <Diiba> So, is there any script to enable the xfce menu in rox.
[02:24] <hyphenated> Almindor: basically, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a horrible horrible hack, and if there's even the hope of a better way, you should choose that instead ;-)
[02:24] <Frogzoo> Almindor: in a nutshell, edit /etc/ld.so.conf & run ldconfig
[02:24] <Almindor> well, /usr/local/lib should be default
[02:24] <blue-frog> anyone familiar with setfacl?
[02:24] <Almindor> it's not my fault it's not
[02:25] <crazy_penguin> re
[02:25] <hyphenated> Almindor: icky. /etc/profile is the main one you'd want to change as a last-resort option
[02:26] <Almindor> Frogzoo, the format of the config is? (man ld.so.conf doesn't say anything)
[02:26] <Terminus> hyphenated: shouldn't it be /etc/environment?
[02:26] <Frogzoo> Almindor: it's just a list of directories
[02:26] <perpetualrabbit> does anyone here have tried debootstrap with dapper?
[02:26] <Almindor> ok so I just write them like that?
[02:26] <elkbuntu> if there is anyone using an IBM Thinkpad T21, could they please do me a favour and tell me what the IO address of the mini pci is?

[02:27] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[02:27] <Terminus> hyphenated: i thought /etc/environment is the canonical location to set env vars since profile is bash specific...
[02:28] <Terminus> oh... and compatibles. heh
[02:28] <hyphenated> Terminus: /etc/profile is 'specific' to almost every shell ;-)
[02:28] <Frogzoo> Almindor: just 'sudo echo /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf ; sudo ldconfig' should do it
[02:28] <Frogzoo> gotta go - I'll be back
[02:28] <Terminus> hyphenated: yeah... i just noticed. anyway, over here, all of the systemwide env vars are in /etc/environment. :)
[02:28] <hyphenated> Frogzoo: if it has to come first (ie: higher priority than /usr/lib) then he might have to change his environment variables
[02:28] <tuxuser19> i want to write some java scripts and run the scripts on Ubuntu 5.10 what is the development kit i have to download
[02:29] <Terminus> tuxuser19: javascript or java?
[02:29] <Sub> tuxuser19, "sudo apt-get install sun-jdk"
[02:29] <hyphenated> but I think it's safe to say that Frogzoo, Terminus and I all think it's a horrible thing to be messing with :-)
[02:29] <Almindor> ok thanks
[02:29] <tuxuser19> Terminus, java
[02:30] <Sub> sorrty tuxuser19  "sudo apt-get install sun-j2sdk1.5 "
[02:30] <Terminus> tuxuser19: go with Sub's suggestion. :)
[02:30] <tuxuser19> sub,so what are the commands to compile/exceute the scripts
[02:31] <Terminus> hyphenated: well, sometimes you need to. it's up to him to decide. :)
[02:31] <Sub> i have no idea, i just know that is the software dev kit :D, i think itz just "java fileyouwanttorun.jar"
[02:31] <hyphenated> Terminus: we can at least make him feel bad for messing with it ;-)
[02:31] <Terminus> hyphenated: oh... right. Frogzoo's solution is a lot better than setting env vars. hehe

[02:32] <tuxuser19> Sub, thanx fr the advise
[02:32] <Sub> java = lame imo
[02:32] <Sub> too slow.
[02:33] <Terminus> hyphenated: well, it just adds stuff to the defaults so where's the harm? unless it replaces and doesn't append. XD
[02:33] <Bilford> when will the first release of Edgy Eft be, would you estimate
[02:33] <Terminus> Sub: java the language seems nice. the VM, not so nice. =D
[02:33] <Sub> exactly :D
[02:34] <Sub> ill stick with python and C thankyou :D
[02:34] <spikeb> you can compile java to native code
[02:34] <spikeb> <3 gcj
[02:34] <Terminus> Bilford: i'd guess same schedule, it's either october or maybe pushed back a month coz of dapper?
[02:34] <hyphenated> Terminus: hmm, that's exactly my opinion of java
[02:34] <hyphenated> the language is fine, the VM is awful
[02:34] <Bilford> Terminus, no, I mean betas
[02:34] <Sub> spikeb it only contains a VM in the applicaiton, so you dont require a VM, doesnt it?
[02:35] <Terminus> Bilford: got me there. i have no idea.
[02:35] <spikeb> sub no. it can do as i said.
[02:35] <hyphenated> Terminus: and adding things to the dynamic loader's defaults is just going to mean adding _more_ things to the dynamic loader's defaults (rinse, repeat)
[02:35] <Bilford> Terminus, what do you mean, pushed back a month?  Isnt Dapper coming out June 1
[02:35] <hyphenated> Terminus: that's what I don't agree with. so the convenience is a short-term tradeoff
[02:35] <shoot> how to boot from cd ?
[02:36] <Terminus> hyphenated: i see...
[02:36] <Bilford> was Dapper supposed to come out May 1
[02:36] <hyphenated> no, it was supposed to come out in the middle of April
[02:36] <Sub> Terminus and Bilford , Edgy is out October as usual.
[02:36] <Terminus> Bilford: dapper was originally scheduled for an april 20 release but was pushed back 6 weeks.
[02:36] <hyphenated> and then got delayed until early June
[02:36] <Sub> Bilford, thats why the version is now 6.06 -> 6th month, 2006
[02:36] <Diiba> Btw, is is sure, that dapper is going out first o'june?
[02:37] <Bilford> Sub, 6th day?
[02:37] <Sub> 1st :D
[02:37] <apokryphos> Diiba: pretty much, yes, unless there are any major showstoppers
[02:37] <hyphenated> Diiba: as sure as the money you paid for it
[02:37] <Bilford> I guess the only thing coming out on the 6th is the new Omen movie
[02:40] <Jazznite> any one help me,please anew one UBUNTU
[02:41] <HymnToLife> !helpme
[02:41] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[02:41] <hyphenated> Jazznite: you haven't even hinted at what this mysterious .bin file might be
[02:41] <Jazznite> how i 'burn' afile,and whit what?? file from A17bar.TK
[02:42] <hyphenated> to a CDR? gnomebaker, k3b.. almost anything really
[02:42] <mabus06> quick how do I mount a usb drive
[02:42] <hyphenated> mabus06: plug it in, see what happens
[02:42] <Terminus> Jazznite: bin cd image? i'd guess run it through binchunker and then burn with whatever burn app you've got. see hyphenated's list.
[02:42] <hyphenated> mabus06: you should get an icon on your desktop or something
[02:43] <miter> i have downloaded a program, and untared it to a dir. Now how can I manually run the program? (it's not a source but a bin!)
[02:43] <Jazznite> Terminus, no a CD is fron A17bar.TK web
[02:43] <mabus06> hyphenated: only if I start the computer with it plugged in, otherwise I have to auto mount.
[02:43] <spikeb> miter: make whatever file you need to run executable, then run it
[02:43] <mabus06> hyphenated: but I have to leave in 10 minutes and I need these documents on my drive to bring to school to print
[02:43] <paradizelost> hey all, i know this doesn't belong here, but i'm getting an ordinal 54 could not be located in wsock32.dll error
[02:43] <miter> spikeb: how can i run it? double-click?
[02:44] <Terminus> Jazznite: well, if it's an ISO, burn it with any of the apps hyphenated mentioned. if it's a bin/cue convert it with bchunk first.
[02:44] <paradizelost> just wondering if anyone knows a quick fix.  it's preventing gaim/firefox from running
[02:44] <spikeb> miter: you can try that yeah
[02:44] <miter> spikeb: it's already made i think, as said, it's not the source
[02:44] <miter> nothing happens when double-clicking :-(
[02:44] <Jazznite> Terminus. Ok i will do, merci!!
[02:44] <hyphenated> miter: what is it?
[02:45] <Terminus> Jazznite: you're welcome. :)
[02:45] <Diiba> COuld someone tell me how to change file locations in terminal (or give link to tutorial.)
[02:45] <miter> kiGB : http://kigb.emuunlim.com/downloads.htm
[02:45] <hyphenated> Diiba: cd
[02:45] <Diiba> :F
[02:45] <Diiba> Mean like, some file to other location.
[02:45] <l> can someone tell me if there is a way to change the icons on the nautilus iconbar?>
[02:45] <gnomefreak> Diiba: do you want to move you or move the files?
[02:45] <Diiba> YES!
[02:46] <aLPHa_LeaK> Diiba, "mv" or "cp"
[02:46] <Diiba> Thank you.
[02:46] <Diiba> Ok.
[02:46] <Diiba> Thank you.
[02:46] <Diiba> Sorry my bad english.
[02:46] <Terminus> Diiba: change dirs? there's a newbie article in the current issue of free software magazine.
[02:46] <gnomefreak> Diiba: cp will copy them (to whereever) mv will move them
[02:46] <aLPHa_LeaK> mv is to move/rename and cp is to copy
[02:46] <Diiba> ok ty.
[02:46] <gnomefreak> Diiba: i would use cp just incase
[02:46] <miter> hyphenated: it's KiGB @ http://kigb.emuunlim.com/downloads.htm
[02:46] <Terminus> Diiba: you might want to read the other stuff in the mag too. you can just download it. it's a pdf.
[02:46] <Diiba> O.k.
[02:46] <hyphenated> miter: ubuntu has 'gndb' available as a gameboy emulator
[02:47] <hyphenated> miter: try that before the headache of random closed-source stuff
[02:47] <miter> ok, but sitll, how would it work?

[02:48] <miter> how to run a plain bin?
[02:48] <Besso> Someone that know how to fix the sound when playing media om Firefox FlashPlayer????
[02:48] <Timma> can anyone help me with installing mplayer?
[02:48] <spikeb> !tell Besso about flash
[02:49] <miter> how can i search the apt-get in command line?
[02:49] <hyphenated> Diiba: http://rute.2038bug.com/rute.html.gz isn't the worst place in the world to start
[02:49] <HymnToLife> Timma> what's the problem ?
[02:49] <hyphenated> miter: apt-cache search foo
[02:49] <Terminus> miter: what does head "foo.bin|grep sh" say?
[02:49] <Diiba> Ok, ty :)
[02:49] <Terminus> miter: if the file starts with #!/bin/sh, you can either chmod +x it or sh foo.sh
[02:50] <Terminus> miter: sh foo.bin i mean.
[02:50] <miter> it's not *dot*bin but only "kigb" (not kigb.bin)
[02:51] <nubuntu> salve
[02:51] <Terminus> miter: "file foo.bin" might also help you determine what it is. if you're sure it's a binary, chmod +x foo.bin and ./foo.bin
[02:51] <miter> foo is the filename?
[02:51] <Terminus> miter: yes.
[02:51] <spikeb> yes
[02:52] <miter> it says
[02:52] <miter> kigb: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
[02:52] <miter> so?
[02:52] <Terminus> miter: chmod it like i said above and then run it.
[02:52] <miter> chmod is for the permission, right?
[02:52] <Terminus> miter: yes. it also sets the execution flag.
[02:52] <miter> and *how* can i run it exactly?
[02:53] <spikeb> execute is a permission, Terminus :)
[02:53] <Terminus> spikeb: my bad. i'm sleepy. :p
[02:53] <miter> how can i run it?
[02:53] <Terminus> miter: like i also said above, ./foo assuming it's in your current dir.
[02:53] <miter> ok
[02:53] <spikeb> Terminus: you need to explain the terminal to miter a bit
[02:53] <spikeb> heh

[02:55] <miter> i get this error when typing ./kigb (in hte kigb dir): ./kigb: error while loading shared libraries: NL.so.1.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[02:55] <Terminus> miter: sh is for scripts written in sh. for an article on the console, please see the current issue of free software magazine, downloadable as a pdf.
[02:55] <spikeb> ahh ok

[03:02] <aLPHa_LeaK> miter, why?
[03:02] <miter> just want to know
[03:02] <HymnToLife> miter> sh file works in some cases

[03:08] <AlinuxOS> hello all, is imac intel core duo supported on linux?
[03:08] <AlinuxOS> I'm thinking about buyng something from apple word.
[03:08] <AlinuxOS> I would like to use linux of course.
[03:08] <miter> rather buy a amd 64 duo
[03:09] <AlinuxOS> miter, why not an apple computer?
[03:09] <alphakernel> AlinuxOS: I don't think it's "supported" but if it's i386 processor I don't see why it an it wouldn't install
[03:09] <Mika_i_> http://qdb.us/60310
[03:09] <Mantice> why :(
[03:09] <miter> overpriced if you see what it actually really can
[03:10] <AlinuxOS> or if it not supported yet...maybe next year :)
[03:10] <Mantice> :P
[03:10] <spikeb> the core duo and core 2 duo processors kick arse.
[03:10] <Mantice> You know after ubuntu installs
[03:10] <alphakernel> Mantice: wut problems are you having installing?
[03:10] <AlinuxOS> so I have no space ..cause I'm a student
[03:10] <miter> athlon64x2 is a wise choice :-) (--> see the benchmarks, reviews, etc...)
[03:10] <Mantice> it configures the packages ?
[03:10] <AlinuxOS> I need something small and powerfull...
[03:10] <Mantice> Mine has locked up at 71 %

[03:10] <Tomcat_> I wouldn't buy Apple if I ran Linux afterwards... there are other good Notebooks available.
[03:10] <AlinuxOS> with good video card to have xgl compiz support :)
[03:11] <miter> well don't buy apple then
[03:11] <alphakernel> AlinuxOS: why not just stick with the OSX
[03:11] <Mantice> Its done it alot of times
[03:11] <AlinuxOS> Tomcat_, yes you've right..but I don't like 5400rpm speed
[03:11] <miter> since it's new intel line is "too new" for linux&drivers

[03:24] <Chrisx1> Mantice sudo reboot
[03:25] <AlinuxOS> miter, and what about using GNOME on Mac OSX?
[03:25] <njan> Chrisx1, what you're looking for is the routing table.
[03:25] <Mantice> Its not in the command line though
[03:25] <suleman> pls help how do i start the text installer on dapper drake thanks
[03:25] <Mantice> Its in some text based gui
[03:25] <Mantice> saying configuring packages
[03:25] <Chrisx1> njan could you help me with that?
[03:25] <njan> Chrisx1, no, I don't have the time to teach you how routing works :)
[03:25] <jonah> hi can anyone tell me what this error means: http://pastebin.com/739205
[03:26] <njan> Chrisx1, you need to look at the subnets your servers are in and figure out how to add a route for that subnet or for those specific hosts which goes via that particular interface
[03:26] <njan> Chrisx1, I'd look at man route for a brief overview, and look at routing and subnetting if you don't know how that works - wikipedia's probably a good starting place.
[03:26] <njan> Chrisx1, are the servers on the same subnet as your machine, and you're wanting to access the internet via a separate wireless network?
[03:26] <Chrisx1> njan, explain how if i try the public ip it doesnt work and the wireless does?(default: wlan0)
[03:27] <GaiaX11> Yesterday i was upgrading a friend of mine PC and it said that threre was no room to complete the task. But, the Hd is 10gb. So, which archives can i clean to make home for upgrading? Is the a command to clean up ubuntu rubish - if it happens to have it?
[03:27] <Chrisx1> am sure they are
[03:27] <njan> Chrisx1, stick the output of ipconfig -a and route on pastebin
[03:27] <njan> Chrisx1, 'sudo ipconfig -a' and 'sudo route', that is..
[03:27] <Chrisx1> ipconfig?
[03:28] <njan> s/ipconfig/ifconfig/
[03:28] <GaiaX11> make room, i mean
[03:28] <Soir> GaiaX11: apt-get clean
[03:28] <njan> I've been spending too much time around win32 :)
[03:28] <JGJones> Quick question - Network Manager - it's wonderful...except...static IP's...can I configure that for static IP's? Thanks.
[03:28] <Opinie> I know that this really must sound like a noob -ish question, but Can somebody help me? I just basically can't get my java working =DD
[03:28] <Soir> GaiaX11: rather, sudo that
[03:28] <Diiba> This is friggin impossible. I found channel where some pissed off runescape players debate from rules of chess.
[03:29] <GaiaX11> Soir, which are this command effects?
[03:29] <Diiba> And when I explained them where they got wrong.
[03:29] <jonah> is there a way to reinstall my default source.list, can ubuntu generate another new list as it does on install? i think mines all a mess
[03:29] <Diiba> They got angry and started to whine about how illogical the rule is.
[03:29] <ranpha> how can you check if you network card is on full duplex mode?
[03:29] <suleman> pls help how do i start the text installer on dapper drake thanks
[03:29] <Soir> GaiaX11: it'll remove the downloaded packed archives still on the system
[03:29] <Healot> ifconfig, ranpha :-
[03:29] <Diiba> They didnt get the rule about stalemate :DD
[03:29] <Opinie> Diiba: which rule didn't they understand?
[03:30] <Opinie> =DD
[03:30] <naosv> lo all :)
[03:30] <ranpha> Healot : where do i need to look for??? nothing about duplex i can find
[03:30] <McScruff> hi, i set up a samba share on my kde ubuntu , but i cant see the share under gnome on a diff pc, pls help
[03:30] <GaiaX11> Soir, will it touch my config files?
[03:30] <Chrisx1> njan: http://pastebin.com/739213
[03:30] <Opinie> but could somebody help me with my java problem?
[03:31] <Diiba> Omg.
[03:31] <Healot> ranpha: just check the mode of tranmission that ifconfig outputs
[03:31] <Diiba> They just kept complaining, how illogical is that when you cant move and its not mate its stalemate...
[03:31] <jonah> hi can anyone help me out please? i just want a fresh breezy source.list as it would make on install - is there a way to reset this?
[03:32] <Healot> apt-get clean
[03:33] <Opinie> Diiba: this just proves one point - which we all have already known - playing runescape makes you stupid...
[03:33] <Diiba> Yes.
[03:34] <njan> Chrisx1, what are the IPs of the servers you're wanting to access via the wired interface?
[03:34] <Diiba> I think i lost few braincells of my own playing the game some years ago.
[03:34] <Chrisx1> njan: 86.7.176.189
[03:34] <Mantice> What should I do reboot my system
[03:34] <njan> Chrisx1, is there a separate internet connection on the wired interface?
[03:34] <Opinie> Diiba: sorry to hear that =/
[03:34] <Diiba> Yep.
[03:35] <Chrisx1> yes
[03:35] <njan> Chrisx1, wait, that IP is the IP of the machine you've given me
[03:35] <Chrisx1> njan yes
[03:35] <Chrisx1> njan thats the 1 i cant access the ssh server and the rest on
[03:35] <ranpha> Healot: sorry quite new in this with symbol is it?
[03:35] <ranpha> with = which
[03:35] <njan> Chrisx1, where are you trying to access the machine you've given me that output for from?
[03:35] <vliedels> Hello i have a problem with booting with ubuntu. It starts booting, installing and then stops at: "retrieving netcfg" with error msg: there was a prob reading data from cd-rom, failed to copy file from cd-rom. Anyone knows what i can do about it??
[03:36] <Opinie> is there a stable version of dapper drake out yeat?
[03:36] <GaiaX11> How do i know how much space was freed by apt-get clean?
[03:36] <Chrisx1> njan: what do you mean?
[03:36] <Hobbsee> Opinie: no. june 1
[03:36] <Chrisx1> oh another pc on a differenent connection
[03:36] <Opinie> ='(
[03:36] <Opinie> Hobbsee: thanks..
[03:36] <njan> Chrisx1, wait a second.. are you asking how to setup services on that machine so they're only accessible via eth0?
[03:37] <Timma2> oh
[03:37] <njan> Chrisx1, so that people on the internet can't talk to them via wlan0?
[03:37] <Chrisx1> njan: when i have wlan0 as default(so i can update and install things) i cant use eth0 AT ALL, i have no idea why, thats my problem
[03:38] <Healot> GaiaX11: type df before and after running "apt-get clean", you'll kniw
[03:38] <njan> Chrisx1, that's because you have two default gateways
[03:38] <Chrisx1> what can i do to fix that?
[03:38] <njan> chris_, you use wlan0 just for accessing the machines in the 192.168.2.0/24 subnet?
[03:39] <Chrisx1> i dont understand that:$
[03:39] <njan> Chrisx1, the purpose of eth0 is for internet connectivity. What is the purpose of wlan0?
[03:40] <Chrisx1> i use wlan0 for Upgrades, downloads and other things like that
[03:40] <Nafallo> Seveas: there? :-)
[03:40] <Chrisx1> i want to use eth0 so i have a public ip that people can access
[03:40] <GaiaX11> Healot, which is the difference betwen apt-get clean and apt-get autoclean?
[03:40] <Antipodean> hey all
[03:40] <Antipodean> ;)
[03:40] <njan> Chrisx1, you're going to run into routing problems doing that.
[03:40] <mephis1987_> !dapper
[03:40] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[03:40] <njan> Chrisx1, multiple internet connections are a pain.
[03:41] <Chrisx1> well i have got my isp to set the ip not to allow downloads if u understand what i mean but the services still work fine
[03:41] <Chrisx1> just i can do updates and downloads
[03:41] <njan> Chrisx1, the routing table is what lets your computer know where ti send network data
[03:41] <Chrisx1> *Cant
[03:41] <njan> Chrisx1, if you have two gateways like that, it'll send data to whichever one is the higher on the routing table
[03:41] <GaiaX11> If i run apt-get clean and apt-get autoclean will it harm my system?
[03:42] <njan> Chrisx1, which means, for instance, if you have the wlan0 interface setup higher, responses to clients connecting via eth0 will get send back via wlan0, and probably dropped as spoofed traffic by the internet provider for that internet connection.
[03:42] <sevtastic> hey all. i have a problem with my ubuntu install. when i lock my workstation my x server crashes and restarts
[03:42] <Chrisx1> eth0 can send data back
[03:42] <njan> Chrisx1, what you'd have to do is setup wlan0 with *no* default gateway (or set it up with a lower priority) and then setup specific routes for the sites you want to access via wlan0
[03:43] <utente> hello
[03:43] <MrRio> hey, how can I make one of those notification in python using dbus
[03:43] <Antipodean> hey pplz - wld this here channel be an inappropriate place for me to ask a VERY n00b question or 2? (new to both Linux & Ubuntu that is)
[03:43] <njan> route add -net 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.2.1 <= something like that, Chrisx1
[03:43] <MrRio> notification popups*
[03:43] <mephis1987_> hello , how can i upgrade my system to dapper ?
[03:43] <njan> which would force the 1.2.3.* subnet to be accessed via 192.168.2.1
[03:43] <HymnToLife> !upgrade
[03:43] <ubotu> methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[03:44] <Chrisx1> njan i think the best thing to do is just insert wireless when needed
[03:44] <Chrisx1> ?
[03:44] <utente> somebody know because doing login from windows in a server linux return login windows?
[03:45] <utente> user and password are correctly
[03:45] <njan> Chrisx1, quite possibly.
[03:45] <HymnToLife> utente> login how ? SSH ?
[03:45] <njan> Chrisx1, like I said, you need to understand what routing and subnetting are :)
[03:46] <Chrisx1> njan: thats going to be hard lol
[03:46] <octan> does any one know of a tool that makes mp3 of audio cd?
[03:46] <utente> i have smb on on ubuntu server
[03:46] <Mantice> AHHHH
[03:46] <HymnToLife> octan> abcde
[03:46] <Chrisx1> njan: is there a way i can change the default card in ssh?
[03:46] <njan> Chrisx1, not particularly, you just need to spend a few hours reading about it and maybe setup a couple of spare PCs or virtual machines and play.
[03:46] <Mantice> It said that it failed to install packages and that some of them will be broken :(
[03:46] <Mantice> Then it locked up
[03:46] <njan> Chrisx1, sshd binds itself to all interfaces by default.
[03:46] <octan> <HymnToLife> ok. i'll check it out
[03:46] <Antipodean> so.... can anybody here perhaps help me getting read access to a NTFS hardisk ?
[03:46] <HymnToLife> !ntfs
[03:46] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[03:46] <njan> Antipodean, reboot into windows.

[03:52] <utente> wich settings you ask me?
[03:52] <HymnToLife> stefanos> search for a .gnome folder in your home and delete it
[03:52] <HymnToLife> then restart GNOME
[03:52] <stefanos> I just wanna know hao i can recover my toolbar
[03:52] <HymnToLife> utente> nop I asked stefanos

[03:52] <mephis1987_> hello
[03:53] <mephis1987_> how to work with ntfs in ubuntu ?
[03:53] <Dr_Willis> actually thers about 4 .gnome directories :) and 2 related  to .gconf and .gconfd
[03:53] <Dr_Willis> !ntfs
[03:53] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[03:53] <ganome> how can i readd windows to my GRUB? it's one hdc1, i have 2 HDs...
[03:53] <mephis1987_> i want to interact with my windoze partitiion ?
[03:53] <Dr_Willis> mephis1987_,  just mount the things and r3ead the data

[03:53] <mephis1987_> Dr_Willis, any idea how change things in ntfs ?
[03:53] <Dr_Willis> mephis1987_,  ahh.. thats different then.. backup your impirntant data, scandisk, defrag. then the installer SHOULD be able to resize
[03:53] <utente> in the user field of login windows add: name host\user but stand here without go on
[03:54] <vliedels> I have a problem with booting with ubuntu. It starts booting, installing and then stops at: "retrieving netcfg" with error msg: "there was a prob reading data from cd-rom, failed to copy file from cd-rom". Anyone knows what i can do about it??
[03:54] <mephis1987_> Dr_Willis, i mean , how to write in ntfs
[03:54] <Dr_Willis> mephis1987_,   normally you 'dont' write to ntfs under a working linux install. Its just risky for ntfs
[03:54] <mephis1987_> not onlyread
[03:54] <McNutella> why does my ubuntu have the kubuntu logo on boot?
[03:54] <Kyral> didja install kubuntu-desktop?
[03:54] <mephis1987_> McJerry, maybe u installed KDE ?
[03:55] <McNutella> Kyral: probably, but I dont use it
[03:55] <mephis1987_> !ntfs
[03:55] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> mephis1987_,  i hear theres  a way or 2 to do it.. but never have done it. I normally just set up windows where it can read/write ext2 (linux) file systems
[03:55] <JoaoJoao> there's captive ntfs, not sure it's still usable
[03:55] <mephis1987_> Dr_Willis, what is the risk doing that ?
[03:55] <HymnToLife> mephis1987_> making the entire partition unusable
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> mephis1987_,  ultimate risk -> data is all gone. :P
[03:56] <gorkendel> there is a spanish ubuntu channel?
[03:56] <HymnToLife> !es

[04:00] <skip> has anybody here ever used the update manager to upgrade distros?
[04:01] <Antipodean> one last question folks, if I'm formatting a HD in Ubuntu, what should I be doing with the "access path" ???
[04:01] <pepe_laredo> We are in a Windows Network (which extends in all the country) and I can't manage firewall and proxy
[04:01] <smaugslayer> sweet - picasa now runs on linux (uses wine) but ill take it
[04:01] <pepe_laredo> 'cause they are ruled by the center of the organization
[04:02] <pepe_laredo> I installed Ubuntu on a machine to use it as a SAMBA file server
[04:02] <McNutella> i cant be bothered with the hassle of wine, i prefer a whisky ;)
[04:02] <smaugslayer> ;)
[04:02] <pepe_laredo> and now I'm tryng to integrate it with Active Directory
=== richiefrich is now known as AttheIgloo
[04:02] <smaugslayer> wine is better w/the ladies ;)
[04:03] <McNutella> smaugslayer: you know it
[04:03] <pepe_laredo> The problem is that I can't download software from the internet,so I need to know if it's possible
[04:03] <pepe_laredo> to download on a CD packages which are not in the installation CDand USE it as a package source.
[04:03] <pepe_laredo> tahnks
[04:04] <Antipodean> well thanks for all your help evrybodies... you've been a lifesave. Have a good one!
[04:04] <skip> has anybody here ever used the update manager to upgrade distros?
[04:04] <Dr_Willis> skip,  yes - all the time
[04:04] <Dr_Willis> skip,  its just as easy to use the shell.
[04:05] <Dr_Willis> but when doing major updates - thers potentials for problems.
[04:05] <Schalken> i have a q
[04:05] <Schalken> i am running dapper gith now
[04:05] <Schalken> right*
=== AttheIgloo is now known as richiefrich
[04:05] <skip> Dr_Willis: I mean do you use it to upgrade from, say, Warty to Hoary?
[04:05] <Schalken> can i update to the stable release, when it comes out, without wiping my harddrive?
[04:06] <spikeb> yes Schalken
[04:06] <Dr_Willis> skip,   may be easier to just do a clean install.
[04:06] <Schalken> and keep all my stuff
[04:06] <t_z> pepe: which packages do you need?  do you have a DVD-ROM drive in the machine?
[04:06] <skip> Dr_Willis: that's what I thought, thanks
[04:07] <Schalken> nice, thnx
[04:07] <KenSentMe> how can i check what codecs are needed to play a video file?
[04:07] <Dr_Willis> skip,  a /home on its own partition makes it easier. :P and i always backup my /etc/ as well
[04:07] <KenSentMe> is there something like gspot for linux?
[04:07] <Dr_Willis> KenSentMe,  ive often used 'vlc --version filename' and read the output.
[04:07] <Dr_Willis> no idea what gspot is.
[04:07] <spikeb> what's gspot?
[04:07] <pepe_laredo> t_z: in the machine i don't have a DVD driver, and I need krb5-user packages (for now) which I think is neither included in the DVD versione
[04:07] <Schalken> normally the w32codecs covers all the formats youd need
[04:08] <distanceisdeath> does anyone know how to install a wireless netgear usb device?
[04:08] <pepe_laredo> so I was thinking about download at home some packages and then, by CD'S create a "local" repository, but I'm not sure if it's possible
[04:08] <KenSentMe> Dr_Willis: it's a small program for windows which displays all kinds of information about a video, including audo/video codecs
[04:10] <zeeble> Hello
[04:10] <Schalken> pepe_larendo, assuming synaptic is like YaST in its repository ways, the yeah you should be able to make a repository on your hard drive
[04:10] <Schalken> on=from
[04:11] <HymnToLife> wouldn't it be easier to just download the DEB and install it on the other box ?
[04:11] <pepe_laredo> maybe I've found a solution here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=98665&postcount=5
[04:11] <pepe_laredo> do you think is good? (now I'm am at home and I cannot make tests)
[04:12] <t_z> pepe_laredo: easiest way is to use DVD release.  otherwise, you can download the .DEBs (per HymnToLife), but you have to get all the dependencies at once.
[04:12] <HymnToLife> some packages don't need much dependencies
[04:12] <HymnToLife> what's the package name ?
[04:13] <pepe_laredo> t_z the dependency is the real problem, I'm sure I'll go for days from House to work with my CD-RW but the DVD I don't think it's a solution

[04:14] <shadow_stalk3r> Hello all
[04:14] <t_z> pepe_laredo: i didn't know about that - it would probably work.  DEBs can be manually installed too with dpkg -i *.deb.

[04:20] <l> Schalken: im afraid i do not know what you mean
[04:20] <Schalken> sry, i mean the Alacarte menu editor
[04:20] <l> Schalken: where do i find this option?
[04:20] <l> Schalken: is that in the repos?
[04:20] <g-nome> Dr_Willis: i just updated some things (kernel, etc...) and my windows entry DISAPPEARED (it was working correctly before this!). Now i don't know how to readd it!?
[04:21] <Schalken> if it hasnt gone missing with the rest of your menu items, it should be under Applications -> Accessories -> Alacarte menu Editor
[04:21] <l> Schalken: i have a menu editor program but it is not called alacarte
[04:21] <Dr_Willis> g-nome,  edit that menu.lst its possible its just showind  some of the entries.. OR you need to scroll down the grub menu on boot to find it.
[04:21] <l> Schalken: and i am not sure that would affect my administration menus

[04:24] <KenSentMe> sparkleytone: that's what i thought too, but it could be
[04:24] <Ophiocus> what are the commands for restarting all network interfaces?
[04:24] <Mysta_> UgzY: you can't see your bios?
[04:24] <sparkleytone> g-nome: probably hd(2,0) for grub
[04:24] <qatsi> good morning all
[04:24] <sparkleytone> Ophiocus: /etc/init.d/networking force-reload
[04:24] <KenSentMe> Ophiocus: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[04:24] <g-nome> Dr_Willis: it's cdrom and floppy i thinks, i know it's strange but it's not me who made that
[04:24] <qatsi> can anyone help me setting up this new xgl and compz stuff please ?
[04:25] <g-nome> sparkleytone: tried hd(2,0) and it didn't work
[04:25] <Dr_Willis> g-nome,  you need to figure out how grub is 'numberign' the drives and use hd#
[04:25] <UgzY> nope, I can't see anything at all
[04:25] <UgzY> I tried to plug in another screen as I used to have 2 screens, but nothing on either screens
[04:25] <g-nome> Dr_Willis: and how :-) ?
[04:25] <UgzY> and there's no bip would could indicate a graphic card pb
[04:25] <Dr_Willis> grub starts #'s at 0, and it MAY be skipping the cdrom/other ide devices.. so i would guess hdc = (hd0,0)
[04:26] <qatsi> no one ?
[04:26] <echobinary> A teacher, showing a small boy how to zip up his coat, said, "The secret is to get the one piece of the zipper to fit in the other piece of the zipper before you try to zip it up." The boy looked at her quizzically. "Why is that a secret?"
[04:26] <Dr_Willis> oops hd(0,0)
[04:26] <echobinary> ..  oops
[04:26] <spikeb> 0,0 is hda1
[04:26] <Ophiocus> i think i ll try force reload, my isp is playing games (read "running some tests") with the line and is sending somesort of drop signal leaving me out of the loop
[04:26] <lukketto> Picasa for  LINUX on google.com !
[04:26] <echobinary> !
[04:26] <spikeb> yup lukketto
[04:26] <ubotu> echobinary: No idea, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[04:26] <MisterN> lukketto: USA only !
[04:26] <lukketto> yes
[04:26] <Schalken> i have a prob:
[04:26] <sparkleytone> g-nome: cat /boot/grub/device.map
[04:26] <Schalken> everything draws on the screen really slowly (windows, textboxes etc etc) and nothing that uses OpenGL works. how can I fix this problem?
[04:27] <Dr_Willis> spikeb,  hd(0,0) MAY be hda1
[04:27] <sparkleytone> g-nome: should tell you what you need to know
[04:27] <Mysta_> UgzY: so are you using a docking station or something?
[04:27] <KenSentMe> I have installed the kernel packages fror i686 on my system. Now everytime my system is updated it updates 1386 too. Can i just delete the i386 packages?

[04:27] <g-nome> sparkleytone: it's hd0
[04:27] <HymnToLife> KenSentMe> pf course you can
[04:27] <vliedels> I have a problem with booting with ubuntu. It starts booting, installing and then stops at: "retrieving netcfg" with error msg: "there was a prob reading data from cd-rom, failed to copy file from cd-rom". Anyone knows what i can do about it??
[04:27] <spikeb> MisterN: they only have us english as a supported language.

[04:27] <g-nome> sparkleytone: so what should i enter now? root (hd0,0)?
[04:27] <UgzY> huh, sorry, but what is a docking station? English is not my mother tongue
[04:27] <sparkleytone> g-nome: yeah...and chainloader +1
[04:28] <l> Schalken: there is a revert option but it is greyed out, as i have yet to make any changes.

[04:28] <zielony> How Can I download movies and photos from my Nokia 6020 ? Gnokii can`t handle this, or i dont know how can I do it...
[04:28] <vliedels> !ntfs
[04:28] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[04:28] <spikeb> MisterN: google is retarded like that
[04:28] <l> Schalken: but it is just an application menu editor
[04:28] <sparkleytone> g-nome: and if the partition isn't bootable...makeactive
[04:28] <Mysta_> UgzY: you are using a notebook (laptop) correct?
[04:28] <Thlayli_> hi! i wann compile mplayer from the repository, but synaptic does not find the package for libmp4v2-0 anywhere
[04:28] <UgzY> yes, it's a laptop
[04:28] <l> Schalken: would not affect my administration menu
[04:28] <distanceisdeath> will someone please help me with a bit of code?
[04:28] <Thlayli_> has anyone got an idea where to get a debian package?
[04:28] <MisterN> spikeb: so that's _really_ their reason?
[04:28] <Thlayli_> i didn'T find one on the web
[04:29] <sparkleytone> g-nome: your windows install is on hdc1 right?
[04:29] <Mysta_> UgzY: are you using a secondary monitor? or are you using the laptops monitor?
[04:29] <spikeb> MisterN: most likely
[04:29] <MisterN> strange folks
[04:29] <UgzY> at the moment I'm using the laptop's monitor
[04:29] <Schalken> l, sorry, i thought by administration menu you meant those ones, wheres the 'administration menu'?
[04:29] <g-nome> sparkleytone: yes i think
[04:29] <spikeb> !info libmp4v2-0

[04:29] <sparkleytone> g-nome: then my info should be useable
[04:29] <MeJoe> How does one get packages to install on an Ubuntu system offline?
[04:29] <l> Schalken: it is under the system menu
[04:29] <spikeb> Thlayli_: enable multiverse
[04:29] <Mysta_> UgzY: does your computer have any tones to let you know that POST passed successfully?
[04:29] <Thlayli_> well why isn't it in my repository?
[04:29] <Thlayli_> i did
[04:29] <Thlayli_> sec
[04:29] <sparkleytone> MeJoe: dpkg -i file.deb
[04:30] <zeeble> Does someone know of a template to use to write a Linux howto/help sorta for a laptop model?
[04:30] <spikeb> hmm
[04:30] <UgzY> nope, I've never heard a tone for anything on this laptop
[04:30] <sparkleytone> zeeble: how much of a template do you want?  you should be able to use any wiki
[04:30] <MeJoe> Where do I go to find the packages to download?
[04:30] <Schalken> l, ahhhh, yes, thats in alacarte as well. isnt it in your menu editor?
[04:30] <ompaul> MeJoe, you need to visit packages.ubuntu.com for the version your using
[04:30] <spikeb> zeeble: tuxmobil.org has a bunch of howtos, you could look there for examples to steal from i guess
[04:30] <Thlayli_> k, i really forgot one multiverse repository
[04:30] <g-nome> sparkleytone: so (hd0,0)?
[04:30] <l> Schalken: NO, I GUESS I WILL INSTALL ALACARTE AND SEE HOW IT WORKS
[04:30] <MeJoe> Ok, thanks. :-)
[04:31] <zeeble> spikeb: ah, ok
[04:31] <spikeb> Schalken: alacarte isn't the defualt menu editor for breezy
[04:31] <Schalken> l, lol, yeah
[04:31] <Schalken> oh okay
[04:31] <stbernard> dfdsf
[04:31] <distanceisdeath> does anyone in here know how to execute  code in a terminal?
[04:31] <Schalken> what kind of code?
[04:31] <HymnToLife> !tell l about caps
[04:31] <sparkleytone> MeJoe: if you don't have constant access, you'll want to `apt-get -d install package1 package2 package#` when you are connected
[04:31] <sparkleytone> g-nome: that should be right
[04:31] <zielony> How Can I download movies and photos from my Nokia 6020 ? Gnokii can`t handle this, or i dont know how can I do it...
[04:32] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, it depends on what kind of code it is, care to put it in paste.ubuntu-nl.org and we can see it and judge it for you?
[04:32] <pedrocr> how do I prevent a user from having ssh access?
[04:32] <distanceisdeath> Schalken: alias wlan0 prism2_usb
[04:32] <Mysta_> UgzY: I can't see ubuntu messing up anything w/ the BIOS. So i'm not sure whats going on
[04:32] <MeJoe> Is there a cd I can download or something that has a bunch of packages to choose from?
[04:32] <l> Schalken: the main thing is that i cannot access my package update manager, i am trying to get to that
[04:32] <pedrocr> I want him to have only local access
[04:32] <distanceisdeath> it says to add it to etc/modprobe.conf

[04:32] <l> Schalken: do you think i will have to re-install gnome?
[04:33] <Schalken> l, no, not yet
[04:33] <UgzY> Mysta> thanks anyway, I guess I'll take it to the repair shop
[04:33] <UgzY>  it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen!
[04:33] <l> Schalken: there is supposed to be a package update manager, which regulalry checks for package updates, but i cannot find it now, as well as all the other items in the administration menu, like login  and all that
[04:33] <distanceisdeath> Schalken do you know find a file called "modprobe.conf"

[04:53] <ubuntu> is there a live version of linux that can handle NTFS drives? (moving and delething archives?)
[04:53] <distanceisdeath> will someone help me with this website?? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Device/NetgearMA111
[04:53] <CharlesE> I have the ubuntu RC of dapper and It keeps loading a live cd and i cant figure out how to install it. Its the 64bit version and the iso i have is labeled as a install (not as a live cd) is this the right cd and if it is how do i install it to the harddrive?
[04:53] <MeJoe> Ok, I will check them both out. :-)
[04:53] <HymnToLife> have we had a media players war yet ?
[04:54] <gnomefreak> ubuntu: not safe to write to ntfs
[04:54] <gnomefreak> CharlesE: #ubuntu+1 please
[04:54] <Kane666> gnomefreak: http://pastebin.com/739380
[04:54] <ubuntu> not safe, but can it be done?
[04:54] <Thlayli_> NoUse: Same dependency problems with your file ^^
[04:54] <ubuntu> the thing is, my windows just went down for good

[04:54] <zeeble> ah
[04:55] <zeeble> i just read about the NTFS

[04:55] <Thlayli_> thanks very much, NoUse
[04:55] <ubuntu> and I need to format drive c: (ntfs
[04:55] <Opticalia> just install windows on some partition and move the files
[04:55] <ubuntu> but first I need to move some files
[04:55] <gnomefreak> ok Kane666 please paste you /etc/apt/sources.list file to pastebin
[04:55] <zeeble> you can just copy. no need to "move", "delete"
[04:55] <ubuntu> but windows formats the partition before installing
[04:56] <ubuntu> and I have no partition empty
[04:56] <Kane666> gnomefreak: can i overwrite that last paste?
[04:56] <gnomefreak> Kane666: hold on yhou might not have to
[04:56] <HymnToLife> ubuntu > just copy the files you want to save from your NTFS to your Linux partition
[04:56] <ubuntu> well yes, copy from one place to another, but I will need to delete
[04:56] <HymnToLife> and then reinstall windows over the previous one
[04:56] <ubuntu> I dont have a linux partiton, Im on live ubuntu
[04:56] <ubuntu> I just have a messed up windows
[04:56] <HymnToLife> resie your NTFS then
[04:56] <MeJoe> Hehe. :-)

[04:57] <CuriosCat> Hi.
[04:57] <DBO> hey CC =)
[04:57] <ubuntu> I saw that option on partiton magic, but what does it mean?
[04:57] <zeeble> he might lose some data on a ntfs resize.
[04:57] <CuriosCat> sup dbo :)
[04:57] <MeJoe> Ubuntu is pretty cool. :-)
[04:57] <zeeble> hello CuriosCat
[04:57] <CuriosCat> I'm downloading the dapper RC
[04:57] <CuriosCat> wondering if I can get it to run off a USB drive :P
[04:57] <HymnToLife> ubuntu > Use the GParted from your live CD to do it
[04:57] <DBO> dapper is at #ubuntu+1, but the answer is no,  not without lots of work
[04:57] <gunya> ubuntu: you need to mount your ntfs, while you're in Ubuntu Live, than backup your files to flash media or record to a CD
[04:58] <Kane666> gnomefreak: http://pastebin.com/739393
[04:58] <NoUse> ubuntu you should run defrag on the ntfs drive priot to attempting a resize
[04:58] <ubuntu> that's a good idea
[04:58] <gunya> ubuntu:  sudo mount -t ntfs -o ro /dev/hda1 /mnt
[04:58] <ubuntu> ubuntu can write to a dvd?
[04:58] <zeeble> sure.
[04:58] <HymnToLife> if you have a burner, yes
[04:58] <gnomefreak> Kane666: delete the conmtents of that file please and leave it open im gonna ive you a new sources.lsit
[04:58] <HymnToLife> and if you gve two drives, sice one has the Live CD in it
[04:59] <ubuntu> gunya, where do I have to write that? which of those parameters is my disk?
[04:59] <gunya> ubuntu, /dev/hda1 corresponds to your ide master
[04:59] <HymnToLife> have*
[04:59] <gunya> ubuntu: run that in the terminal
[04:59] <Kane666> gnomefreak: sorry, what do you mean>
[04:59] <Kane666> ?
[04:59] <ubuntu> ups....
[04:59] <ubuntu> but cant I take out ubuntu?
[04:59] <zeeble> hehe.
[04:59] <gunya> ubuntu, once you run that command, you should see your ntfs partition mounted onto /mnt directory
[04:59] <HymnToLife> you can't eject a Live CD while it's in use
[05:00] <gnomefreak> Kane666: delete all contents of the file /etc/apt/sources.list please
[05:00] <ubuntu> let me find the terminal....
[05:00] <gunya> ubuntu, use a usb flash stick or something
[05:00] <gnomefreak> Kane666: you opened it with gksudo "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" right?

[05:17] <gorkendel> hola de nuevo

[05:17] <HymnToLife> nope, I'm on Windows :D

[05:27] <F0LL0W3R> <gnomefreak> ok am sorry
[05:28] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, perhaps you should consider actually doing what I asked you do it
[05:28] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, do not it
[05:28] <gnomefreak> Kane_666: try rebooting
[05:28] <distanceisdeath> what did you ask me?
[05:28] <distanceisdeath> do not it?
[05:28] <distanceisdeath> ohh
[05:28] <distanceisdeath> woops my bad man
[05:28] <ompaul> distanceisdeath,  try to do this>> gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.conf <<   this time without the <> and when it is open put in that that text
[05:29] <gnomefreak> Kane_666: i think its a dns issue kane if you reboot it should set dns back and it should work than
[05:29] <planetguru> beer o'clock already?
[05:31] <steve> you guys are way over my head is there anyone I can talk to about doing stuff like installing mp3 and movie players?
[05:31] <Rinnt> Can anyone here install rsyslog with apt?
[05:31] <ompaul> !tell steve about restricted formats
[05:31] <Schalken> steve, have a look here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[05:31] <steve> k thanks
[05:31] <ompaul> steve, read the page the bot pointed you do
[05:31] <distanceisdeath> ompaul" i did what you said...i entered my password and it opened a text document
[05:32] <NoUse> Rinnt I'm not sure its in the repos
[05:32] <Schalken> ompaul, dont you call me a bot you bot
[05:32] <Schalken> :D :D :D
[05:32] <CrippsFX> anybody here have experience with RAID?
[05:32] <Rinnt> NoUse: I think you're right... i tried apt-get install rsyslog and it said it couldn't find it
[05:32] <NoUse> Rinnt yeah its not there
[05:32] <Rinnt> NoUse: dang... u would think it woudl be a bit more popular.... so i have to pull it from the web?
[05:32] <ompaul> Schalken, the line before yours d-_-b (how do you do a backwards b anyway)
[05:32] <gnomefreak> its not in dapper sources either NoUse
[05:33] <NoUse> gnomefreak thanks
[05:33] <gnomefreak> yw
[05:33] <NoUse> Rinnt yeah I guess so
[05:33] <Phopsy> Hey all
[05:33] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, now put the text you want to put in the file in there - save and exit
[05:33] <distanceisdeath> okay
[05:33] <distanceisdeath> brb
[05:33] <Corey> hey guys
[05:33] <Corey> how do you delete files in terminal
[05:33] <Corey> like using a terminal command
[05:33] <Chrisx1> rm filename
[05:33] <gnomefreak> Corey: rm
[05:33] <Chrisx1> ?
[05:33] <Schalken> Corey, use rm
[05:34] <Schalken> yer
[05:34] <Corey> ok thanks :D
[05:34] <Phopsy> Can someone tell me whether or not Ubuntu supports NTFS drives from box?
[05:34] <Some_Person> I need help with UBUNTU install!
[05:34] <gnomefreak> rm /path/to/file or cd to it and rm that way
[05:34] <Some_Person> Both the GRUB and LILO installs failed
[05:34] <Some_Person> And the Continue without bootloader failed
[05:34] <Corey> i need to delete a directory
[05:34] <distanceisdeath> ompaul: it says it could not save
[05:34] <Corey> like a folder how do i do that ?
[05:34] <Some_Person> So i chose finish
[05:34] <gnomefreak> Corey: rm -r to delete a dir
[05:34] <Some_Person> what do i do now
[05:34] <NoUse> Phopsy read support, not write support
[05:34] <ompaul> Phopsy, not straight away, small amount of work, also don't try to write to it, that does not work
[05:34] <Some_Person> i cannot boot to ubuntu
[05:35] <HymnToLife> Corey> (sudo) rm -rf /path/tofolder
[05:35] <Some_Person> i can use a live cd
[05:35] <gnomefreak> or that way ;)
[05:35] <Corey> thanks :)
[05:35] <Some_Person> any suggestions?
[05:35] <echobinary> how different is dapper rc than dapper flight7 with all the updates installed?
[05:35] <HymnToLife> add the f if the folder is not empty
[05:35] <gnomefreak> echobinary: more stable
[05:35] <Phopsy> OmPaul, NoUse, thanks. Could you suggest a method of reformatting a BIG HDD to FAT32 from within WinXP?
[05:35] <Some_Person> i tried to install Breezy
[05:36] <ompaul> Phopsy, no, I know nothing of winxp
[05:36] <HymnToLife> Phopsy> Right click > Format in My Computer
[05:36] <Some_Person> do you know how to fix my problem?
[05:36] <distanceisdeath> ompaul: the text document didnt save
[05:36] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: check the md5
[05:36] <Some_Person> of what?
[05:36] <Chrisx1> i have a question, when i select 1 network card as default why is the other disabled?
[05:36] <gnomefreak> make sure its the same as on the link that you got it from
[05:36] <Corey> thanks guys :)
[05:36] <Corey> cya
[05:36] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, I am checking how to achieve that now
[05:37] <Phopsy> HymntoLife: Doesn't work, I'm afraid, XP won't format to FAT32
[05:37] <distanceisdeath> oh sorry
[05:37] <Some_Person> i got the cd in the mail through ShitIt
[05:37] <l> can someone tell me if there is a way to make gnome-terminal support multiple languages?
[05:37] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, this is unsual - please give me a minute
[05:37] <gnomefreak> Phopsy: sure it will
[05:37] <HymnToLife> Phopsy> It definitely will
[05:37] <Some_Person> I mean ShipIt
[05:37] <Phopsy> My version won't...
[05:37] <gnomefreak> Phopsy: xp ill use fat32 or ntfs
[05:37] <Schalken> Same_Person: there should be a 'check cd integrity' option
[05:37] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: try another one
[05:37] <Some_Person> But it should be ok
[05:37] <Schalken> or something like that anyway
[05:37] <Some_Person> I got it in ShipIt
[05:37] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: not really
[05:37] <Chrisx1> i have a question, when i select 1 network card as default why is the other disabled?
[05:37] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: it doesnt matter wher eyou got it from
[05:38] <Some_Person> it's a pressed cd
[05:38] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: it doesnt matter
[05:38] <Some_Person> and the live one works perfectly
[05:38] <l> can someone help me? a large amount of items have gone missing from my administration menu
[05:38] <gnomefreak> Some_Person: check the md5
[05:38] <wims> !apache
[05:38] <ubotu> apache is, like, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[05:38] <Schalken> LOL
[05:38] <Schalken> hey L!
[05:38] <Some_Person> do i have to format the ext3 partition?
[05:39] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, join me in #ubuntu-ie as you seem not to be catching all I am saying
[05:39] <Phopsy> Gnomefreak, HymntoLife: Do you think a Win98 bootdisk would format a HDD to FAT32?
[05:39] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, you can click on #ubuntu-ie for that
[05:40] <Some_Person> by the way, i resized my ntfs partition with BootIt NG
[05:40] <gnomefreak> Phopsy: yes it will
[05:40] <NoUse> Phopsy if you just want to format the drive, if you have data on that drive it will be deleted
[05:40] <EcoBlue> I want Windows back. :(
[05:41] <Phopsy> NoUse: Of course! I knows that! :D It's an empty drive for the minute, I need to move some files to it when I switch
[05:41] <HymnToLife> Phopsy> in what FS is the drive atm ? I think XP's disk manager should do it too
[05:41] <Phopsy> HTL: It's in NTFS at the moment. I have the management console open, and it will only reformat in NTFS
[05:41] <Phopsy> :(
=== IronMask is now known as IronMask|Sleep
[05:42] <Chrisx1> i have a question, when i select 1 network card as default why is the other disabled?
[05:42] <NoUse> Phopsy just delete the partition and recreate it
[05:42] <Phopsy> Good plan
[05:43] <jspiro> hi all, who here is an op?
[05:43] <Schalken> op?
[05:43] <mjk64> Could someone please explain the difference between "restricted" and "multiverse"? One is "not completely free" and the other is "non-free"? What is "not completely free" - something like a program with publicly available source, but which must not be modified in any way?
[05:43] <echobinary> smooth operator
[05:43] <jspiro> Schalken: someone wants to get unbanned.
[05:43] <echobinary> ..doh
[05:43] <Phopsy> NoUse: Tried that, it will only recreate in NTFS as well...
[05:43] <Schalken> .......okay
[05:43] <l> can someone help me? a large amount of items have gone missing from my administration menu
[05:43] <apokryphos> Schalken: what's the problem?
[05:44] <NoUse> Phopsy something is wrong with your Windows :-)
[05:44] <Schalken> ?nothing?
[05:44] <echobinary> Phopsy: have you tried formatting from the terminal?
[05:44] <jspiro> Schalken: he is in #winehq now
[05:44] <Schalken> what? who?
[05:44] <ishkabob> Phopsy: what is the problem
[05:44] <echobinary> # sudo mkfs.ext3 -f   (force option)  /dev/your harddrive
[05:44] <Phopsy> NoUse: I know, hence the desire to move to Ubuntu.
[05:44] <apokryphos> * jspiro
[05:44] <Some_Person> please help me
[05:44] <jspiro> Schalken: semboy
[05:44] <apokryphos> !helpme
[05:44] <Frogzoo> !helpme
[05:44] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[05:44] <NoUse> Phopsy linux can create fat32 file systems too
[05:44] <echobinary> haa ha
[05:44] <Frogzoo> works every time :)
[05:44] <Schalken> mjk64: look up Ubuntu in Wikipedia, they have a little table there that explains multiverse restricted supported universe etc
[05:45] <Some_Person> do i need to format my ext3 partition?
[05:45] <mjk64> Schalken: Ah, thanks!
[05:45] <Frogzoo> Some_Person: only if it's not formatted already
[05:45] <apokryphos> mjk64: /msg ubotu components
[05:45] <NoUse> Some_Person what are you trying to do?
[05:45] <apokryphos> explains the distinction
[05:45] <mjk64> apokryphos: Thanks!
[05:45] <Some_Person> i think i need to reinstall
[05:45] <Phopsy> NoUse: It's because of the restrictions XP imposes on FAT32 formatting...Limited to 32GB
[05:45] <Some_Person> i installed ubuntu without a bootloader
[05:45] <Frogzoo> Some_Person: do you have any data you need to keep?
[05:45] <apokryphos> Some_Person: /msg ubotu grub
[05:45] <Some_Person> no
[05:46] <NoUse> Phopsy I have a 320GB Fat32 FS on my system
[05:46] <Frogzoo> Some_Person: cool - the reinstall will take care of it
[05:46] <Some_Person> the grub and lio installs both failed during install
[05:46] <apokryphos> there are other ways to recover the MBR
[05:46] <Frogzoo> NoUse: urgh...
[05:46] <Diegan> which is the command to give all permissions to a folder?
[05:46] <NoUse> Frogzoo ?
[05:46] <Phopsy> NoUse: Thanks...I've read a few articles that seem to support the idea of limitation to partition size with FAT32.
[05:46] <Frogzoo> NoUse: lots of wasted space...
[05:47] <Freenux> Salut ;)
[05:47] <ishkabob> i have a question, i'm installed a program via aptitude called amsynth.  The general functionality of the program works, however, its supposed to be using gtk calls, and the window is all smooshed together and, well, NOT using gtk calls
[05:47] <Phopsy> Would I be able to format it from from a Damn Small Linux LiveCD?
[05:47] <Freenux> hi
[05:47] <cr3> is there a way to purge some of the disk space used in /var/cache/apt?
[05:47] <NoUse> Frogzoo eh
[05:47] <Some_Person> how do i format my ext3 partition?
[05:47] <Frogzoo> NoUse: you'd pack more data in using ext3
[05:47] <jspiro> cr3: sudo apt-get clean
[05:47] <Some_Person> and which is better: LILO or GRUB?
[05:47] <jspiro> Some_Person: grub
[05:47] <njan> Some_Person, mkfs, and grub.
[05:47] <Some_Person> and why?
[05:48] <njan> Some_Person, more flexible, better supported.
[05:48] <Frogzoo> Some_Person: grub's easier to work with - lilo can do some things grub can't, but mostly that's exotic uses
[05:48] <NoUse> Frogzoo if I really miss the 10 or so gigs I've lost I'll reconsider, but I'm not even close to filling it
[05:48] <Some_Person> does GRUB work with BootPart?
[05:48] <Frogzoo> NoUse: sure
[05:48] <Schalken> ishkabob: a program built for your version of Gtk will use your version of Gtk. maybe its supposed to be using Qt? maybe its just corrupt?
[05:48] <Phopsy> NoUse: Would I be able to format it from from a Damn Small Linux LiveCD?
[05:49] <NoUse> Phopsy yes
[05:49] <Schalken> ishkabob: maybe theres a seperate package you need to make it use Gtk?
[05:49] <Phopsy> NoUse: Thanks, I'll give that a shot :D
[05:49] <ishkabob> Shalken: well, none of its dependencies are on Qt
[05:49] <ishkabob> Schalken: it doesn't show any "recommended" packages
[05:50] <ishkabob> Schalken: i built it from source to just to see if it would work
[05:50] <ishkabob> no dice
[05:50] <Schalken> perhaps there was a problem with linking to the Gtk libraries then?
[05:50] <Phopsy> Thanks all, see you when I'm with Ubuntu
[05:50] <mjk64> If I understood the Ubuntu Wikipedia entry and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components correctly, the only difference between "restricted" and "multiverse" is that "multiverse" is not supported, right?
[05:51] <Schalken> mjk64: well thats what i gathered from WIkipedia, so... yeah.
[05:51] <ishkabob> thats what i'm thinking, is there a general way to go about checking that?
[05:51] <tadeu> oi
[05:51] <ishkabob> i was thinking that upgrading to dapper might help
[05:51] <Frogzoo> mjk64: they're both unsupported - but multiverse is public domain, restricted is proprietary (methinks)
[05:51] <EcoBlue> How do I set up a root password?
[05:51] <Frogzoo> !root
[05:51] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[05:51] <mjk64> Frogzoo: "The restricted component is reserved for software that is very commonly used, and which is supported by the Ubuntu team..."
[05:52] <Frogzoo> !restricted
[05:52] <ubotu> I guess restricted is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats  Most of the formats listed there can be replaced by !FreeFormats
[05:52] <mjk64> Frogzoo: So "restricted" is also supported (but less supported than "main", of course).
[05:52] <l> can someone help me? a large amount of items have gone missing from my administration menu
[05:52] <jspiro> in Debian, the entire repo is supported.
[05:52] <jspiro> l: yes, someone can help you. :)
[05:52] <mjk64> jspiro: Hmm ....
[05:53] <l> jspiro excellent. who.
[05:53] <l> ;)
[05:53] <jspiro> l: dunno. maybe you should ask your question. :)
[05:53] <ishkabob> l: what has gone missing?
[05:53] <Schalken> l!
[05:53] <l> everything exceptdevice manager printing and synaptic
[05:54] <jspiro> mjk64: yes
[05:54] <twager> Anyone using ktorrent ?
[05:54] <Schalken> l: can you get alacarte?
[05:54] <l> i did not find it in the repos
[05:54] <ishkabob> l: are you running breezy?
[05:54] <l> yes, breezy
[05:54] <ishkabob> l: you can probably out them back with smeg
[05:54] <mjk64> jspiro: That's good news, but this also means that it's little more difficult to decide between Debian and Ubuntu. :-}
[05:55] <ishkabob> go to a terminal and type sudo smeg
[05:55] <jspiro> mjk64: ask in ##linux which to use. they are neutral.
[05:55] <Schalken> l: i would install alacarte and have it revert the menus, but if you cant get it for breezy, thats all ive got
[05:55] <mjk64> jspire: Hehe, good hint. :-)
[05:55] <l> no, smeg does not allow you to change anything under the system menu
[05:55] <l> only applications
[05:56] <Schalken> l: maybe you can edit some file somewhere where the menu items are put
[05:56] <l> im thinking i might have to re-install gnome.
[05:56] <ishkabob> mmmmm, how bout removing that menu and putting it back
[05:56] <ishkabob> with the gnome menu editor
[05:56] <l> there is no way to remove it or put it back
[05:56] <ishkabob> er gnome panel editor
[05:56] <Schalken> ishkabob: his menu editor wont handle the admin menu
[05:56] <l> ishkabob: ah. i will try that
[05:57] <Amaranth> that won't help
[05:57] <Schalken> ishkabob: gnome panel editor handles the three menus as one unit
[05:57] <l> ishkabob: unfortunately that did not work.
[05:57] <l> they are still not there
[05:57] <Amaranth> what files do you have in ~/.config/menus/?
[05:57] <ishkabob> yeah there you go
[05:57] <Schalken> ishkabob: ah there you go!
[05:57] <ishkabob> i feel like i had this problem once before
[05:58] <l> Amaranth: APPLICATIONS.MENU AND KDE-APPLICATIONS.MENU
[05:58] <l> pardon the caps
[05:58] <Amaranth> hrm
=== beyond is now known as beyond-rango
[05:58] <Amaranth> l: what do you have in ~/.local/share/applications/?
[05:59] <l> Amaranth: everything that should be there. they just dont show up on the menu
[05:59] <ishkabob> is it bad etiquette to ask my question again hoping someone who has signed on recently might help?
[05:59] <Amaranth> uh
[05:59] <Amaranth> nothing should be there
[05:59] <l> Amaranth: i think it might have happened after i installed kde
[05:59] <Sub> ishkabob, whats your problem?
[05:59] <Sub> as long as you dont ask constantly over and over it's okay
[06:00] <l> Amaranth: why would nothing be there
[06:00] <mjr> yah, it's okay once in a while
[06:00] <EcoBlue> How do I get kpackage to install things? I hit "Install" and it does nothing.
[06:00] <Amaranth> l: only things you've changed should be in there
[06:00] <Amaranth> did you use kmenuedit at any time?
[06:00] <l> Amaranth: I DID CHANGE SOME MENU ITEMS AFTER I INSTALLED KDE
[06:00] <l> again, caps, sorry
[06:00] <l> Amaranth: yes
=== nalioth is now known as noirequus
[06:01] <ishkabob> Sub: well, i installed via aptitude a program called amsynth that is supposed to use gtk libraries.  When i open the program the items are all squashed together and its certainly not using gtk calls
[06:01] <kubuntu_> Ecoblue what is the extension of the file?
[06:01] <l> Amaranth: and i have since removed kde
[06:01] <Amaranth> l: ok, ugly solution but it should fix things
[06:01] <Sub> ishkabob, to be honest that sounds like an issue with amsynth and not ubuntu, so this is probably not the best place to ask.
[06:02] <ishkabob> you're probably right, is there a better channel for this issue?
[06:02] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, it is a .deb
[06:02] <Amaranth> l: rm -rf ~/.config/menus/ ~/.local/share/applications/ ~/.local/share/desktop-directories/
[06:02] <Amaranth> l: you'll lose all of your menu changes
[06:03] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - go to a command line and type man dpkg
[06:03] <l> Amaranth: but they should return to defaults right?
[06:03] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - you can use dpkg
[06:03] <Schalken> ishkabob: perhaps some kind of discussion area (forum, irc etc) for and handles by amsynth?
[06:03] <Schalken> handled*
[06:03] <Amaranth> l: yep
[06:03] <l> then it is fine
[06:04] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, it doesn't o anything when i type it in, only "File not found" error
[06:04] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - make sure you are typing it right
[06:04] <EcoBlue> I am
[06:04] <l> Amaranth: ok, everything is fine now, thank you
[06:04] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - and that the path is right
[06:04] <EcoBlue> IT is
[06:05] <KenSentMe> Is there a wysiwyg flash editor for linux?
[06:05] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - did you Md5 the file?/
[06:05] <l> Amaranth: is there a way to make update managerrun automatically whenever there are updates?
[06:05] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - file may be corrupted so delete and download again then try dpkg and you should be good
[06:05] <Amaranth> l: no
[06:05] <EcoBlue> Hmmm.
[06:05] <Amaranth> l: i think it checks for updates once a day
[06:05] <l> ok
[06:06] <EcoBlue> I cannot get wine to run with the .deb file
[06:07] <Amaranth> EcoBlue: trying to installl picasa?
[06:07] <EcoBlue> Picasa? What is hat?
[06:07] <EcoBlue> *That
[06:08] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - its a shitty google image "editing" program
[06:08] <EcoBlue> I'm not trying to install that...
[06:08] <Sub> "editing" , itz a photo organiser.
[06:08] <EcoBlue> I want to run my games and stuff again.
[06:08] <EcoBlue> Seeing as I have to run ubuntu now.
[06:08] <kubuntu_> sub - google should stick to search engines
[06:09] <Schalken> quick question: is cedega supposed to work in a 64bit linux distro?
[06:09] <Sub> and kubuntu_ i'd hardly call it shitty, it's a decent app.
[06:09] <Sub> kubuntu_, I hope your realise that google BOUGHT picasa, they did'nt make it, merely slapped their logo on it.
[06:09] <kubuntu_> sub its all good we all have our opinions
[06:10] <Sub> so they are sticking to search engines, they just have the money to splash about and buy smaller companies up.
[06:10] <andrew_> What does LTS mean?
[06:10] <EcoBlue> I want windows again. :(
[06:10] <NoUse> andrew_ Long Term Support I believe
[06:11] <kubuntu_> sub - yeah. i really don't care what they do as I don't like them. Just my 2c.
[06:11] <Schalken> what about 'Flight 7', is that just another name for Dapper, or is it the level of beta or something?
[06:12] <jryer_>  I want to install edubuntu in Spanish and I DO NOT have internet. How?
[06:13] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - you might want to check out Xen or Vmware

[06:13] <Frogzoo> EcoBlue: kubuntu_ kqemu also
[06:14] <Versed`> its pretty good for organizing and a quick fix.
[06:14] <kubuntu_> Versed - there are tons of free/open source tools that can run circles around picassa
[06:14] <Frogzoo> EcoBlue: what's the issue? how can you possibly prefer doze to Linux?

[06:14] <jryer_> Versed: I think spanish CDs are offered but I just want to add the language packages if that is possible.

[06:14] <Archville> Hello.
[06:15] <Frogzoo> Schalken: dapper will be released june 1
[06:15] <Frogzoo> !dapper
[06:15] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[06:15] <Archville> I notice a bit of lag in some games. The sound is a bit out of synch with video.  Is there something i could try to fix it ?
[06:15] <Frogzoo> Archville: under wine?
[06:15] <Archville> I mean, the games don't run slow. Is the sound what isn't good.
[06:15] <Versed`> Only thing decent I've seen was The Gimp and it has a neurotic system of doing things.  But to be honest if I am going to do photo editting I'd do it on my Mac.
[06:15] <Archville> No, every app.
[06:15] <andrew_> That's soon.
[06:16] <Archville> Just sound out of synch about... 100 ms.
[06:16] <Ophiocus> is there gonna be any online event on june 1st?
=== andrew_ is now known as AndrewCaul
[06:16] <Frogzoo> Ophiocus: yes - the repo server will fall on its head :)
[06:16] <gnomefreak> yeah #ubuntu and #ubuntu+1 merging
[06:16] <Ophiocus> heh
[06:17] <kubuntu_> Versed - I am sorry to hear you have a mac. lol just kidding =)
[06:17] <Archville> Maybe the sound thing is an ALSA problem.
[06:17] <Versed`> haha, np
[06:17] <Archville> Or just SDL thing.
[06:17] <Ophiocus> gnomefreak: dosent ubuntu+1 become edgy eft?
[06:17] <gnomefreak> Ophiocus: not right away
[06:17] <deadcake> i am deciding to use windows instead of ubuntu
[06:17] <deadcake> i have thousands of problems
[06:17] <gnomefreak> its gonna be a little while befor ethe first set up repos are opened
[06:18] <kubuntu_> Versed - you should check out REAL bsd's then. =)
[06:18] <Ophiocus> ah right
[06:18] <gnomefreak> deadcake: start with most important and tell us a lil about it
[06:18] <Versed`> I would love to grab the dapper beta's but got 5.10 running real well on my older g4-450, I think I waited this long I can wait another few weeks for the official release.
[06:18] <kubuntu_> deadcake - THOUSANDS!  What?!?!
[06:18] <deadcake> every administration application doesn't start....
[06:18] <deadcake> i see they on the taskbar
[06:18] <deadcake> but nothing
[06:18] <deadcake> they disappear
[06:19] <gnomefreak> deadcake: are you entering your user pasword when it asks for a password
[06:19] <deadcake> it doesn't asks for a password
[06:19] <deadcake> it just closes automatic
[06:19] <gnomefreak> deadcake: try killall gnome-panel if in gnome
[06:19] <deadcake> i tried with terminal
[06:19] <deadcake> deadcake@ubuntu:~$ sudo gparted
[06:19] <deadcake> sudo: unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname()
[06:20] <CoOlGhOsT> I recently installed ubuntu (migrated from mandriva), then afterwards i installed the kubuntu packages. when i use the "log off" menu item in KDE i only have an option of "End session". How do I get options of closing the computer etc in the dialog that appears???

[06:20] <AndrewCaul> add ubuntu to your hosts file.
[06:20] <distanceisdeath> does anyone here use wireless internet????
[06:20] <deadcake> i tried killall

[06:21] <distanceisdeath> can you tell me how to set it up in ubuntu
[06:21] <shoe> if I dual boot with ubuntu is there away to uninstall it without it affecting my windows partition?
[06:21] <distanceisdeath> im doing what this says https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Device/NetgearMA111
[06:21] <void^> deadcake: < AndrewCaul> add ubuntu to your hosts file.
[06:21] <Versed`> but, I was lucky ubuntu automatically installed the wifi drivers on my computer and it was up and running.
[06:21] <distanceisdeath> but i dont get it
[06:21] <Archville> deadcake: killall -9 ?
[06:22] <R_a_f_a_E_L>  How can I automatically open X-Chat in the same time I start Ubuntu?

[06:22] <deadcake> Archville, i tried killall gnome-panel
[06:23] <Archville> Try killall -9 proccess
[06:23] <distanceisdeath> so can anyone help? something went wrong with the editing of the files i guess
[06:23] <R_a_f_a_E_L>  How can I automatically open X-Chat in the same time I start Ubuntu?

[06:26] <dions> Good afternoon all. I have a quick question. I am currently a Gentoo user but am going to reload my machine. I want to install Dapper but am wondering how easy it is to get w32codecs and xine backend along with DMA and such installed.
[06:27] <Mark1412> hello
[06:27] <Mark1412> i ihad a question
[06:27] <giallu> is nont enough to uncomment all in the source.list?
[06:27] <eggzeck> dions, easy
[06:27] <Spec> dions: pretty easy
[06:27] <NoUse> dions very easy
[06:27] <Mark1412> what programs are there that you can use to convert mp3 to wav
[06:27] <Ribs> dions: Wait until June 1st when it actually released :>
[06:27] <Spec> especially converting from gentoo ...
[06:27] <dions> I know that Breezy has Automatix is there something for Dapper?
[06:27] <eggzeck> Ribs, he doesn't *have* too
[06:27] <dekela> !<factoid>
[06:27] <ubotu> dekela: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[06:27] <kubuntu_> dions - if you use Gentoo then Dapper will be a breeze for you. =)
[06:27] <Ribs> true
[06:27] <Ophiocus> dions there are howto s for each you mentioned, and dma can be active from the very install
[06:27] <dions> Ribs, Why?
[06:27] <Ribs> but I'd reccomend it
[06:28] <NoUse> !tell dions about easyubuntu

[06:28] <wims> Frogzoo, thank you

[06:28] <eggzeck> I say do what you want
[06:28] <Ribs> dions: because Dapper isn't finished yet... and you have big downloads of updates right now
[06:28] <Ophiocus> kubuntu_:  pun-o-the day
[06:28] <Spec> !pun
[06:28] <ubotu> I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Spec
[06:28] <Spec> wanker
[06:29] <eggzeck> dions, don't be afraid to upgrade
[06:29] <dions> Thank you all I will down load flight 6 tonight and look at installing. I did not think it would be difficult just wanted to make sure. I have heard great things about Ubuntu and I am tired of long compile times for little gain.
[06:29] <Ophiocus> Spec:  now that we know your profesion,. tell us about your hobbies
[06:29] <dions> Ribs, I do not mind the large downloads. I have a  15mbs connection
[06:30] <kubuntu_> ophiocus why do you hate kubuntu?
[06:30] <Ribs> ah
[06:30] <Ribs> fair cop :)
[06:30] <eggzeck> dions, there aren't any *long* download
[06:30] <Ribs> most of the annoying bugs have gone now as well
[06:30] <Ribs> eggzeck: I had a ~300mb download the other day
[06:30] <eggzeck> Ribs, that's not *long* heh
[06:30] <Ophiocus> ? nah man the "breeze" sentence you gave, good pun
[06:30] <Ribs> I'd say that's long, given the distro CD is only 640mb
[06:30] <eggzeck> nor big, 300MB is fairly TINY
[06:31] <Spec> Ophiocus: my hobbies? #ubuntu+1 of course ^.^
[06:31] <disinterested_pe> i did one 644 mbs when i was on windows
[06:31] <eggzeck> that's like complaining about a 300KB download
[06:31] <disinterested_pe> took about 2 hrs
[06:31] <dekela> Anybody knows how do I mound 3 lvm type system disks?
[06:31] <dekela> mount
[06:31] <kubuntu_> ophiocus - oh. I have a tendency lean toward a humorous interpretation of the world. Lol
[06:31] <giallu> i have adde multiverse but is the same
[06:31] <dions> eggzeck, do you use xgl? i have been messing with it on my gentoo box. I know that some ubuntu developers are working on cool compiz plugins. I may have to try this out on dapper.
[06:31] <giallu> i don't find it

[06:33] <EcoBlue> Ubuntu is too hard to install things like Firefox 1.54
[06:33] <EcoBlue> *1.5
[06:33] <Linux_Junkie> EcoBlue, is there a easy way to upgrade to 1.5 ?
[06:33] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - relax man - you can fix it and get anything you need working
[06:33] <silasj> hi
[06:33] <Ophiocus> EcoBlue: FF1.5 is standard in dapper
[06:33] <giallu> there is an how-to for firefo 1.5
[06:33] <Linux_Junkie> Ophiocus, bingo thanks
[06:33] <Linux_Junkie> Ophiocus a friend a mine just installed ubuntu but i reckon he didn't install the latest version.
[06:34] <silasj> Is mkfs.vfat /dev/hda<number> enough for making a new DOS filesystem?
[06:34] <dions> Ophiocus, I have used 3ddesktop before XGL started to get more stable. currently I can run XGL with little crashes. 3ddesktop is a nice app though without changing your enitre x server.

[06:35] <McScruff> hi, i set up a samba share on my kde ubuntu , but i cant see the share under gnome on a diff pc, pls help
[06:35] <giallu> what is dapper?
[06:35] <dions> Spec, XGL is a whole different animal with cool opengl effects for your desktop.
[06:35] <Spec> in the server, edit 'freenode' and check "join this server when xchat is started"
[06:35] <[NP] Tangent> the connection always just starts idling after a few hours
[06:35] <giallu> i want only to install mplayer!
[06:35] <Spec> dions: i've used xgl a bit i've never used 3ddesktop
[06:36] <[NP] Tangent> someone gave me a command to try
[06:36] <Dr_Willis> McScruff,  set up a samba password for the user with 'sudo smbpasswd -a username'
[06:36] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: I've read several people complaining of the same thing - i don't know how they resolved it. :-/
[06:36] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, I don't have a way to reinstall windows, that's the problem. My computer cam with a reinstalling partition, and I can't seem to run that in ubuntu.
[06:36] <AndrewCaul> Dapper is Dapper Drake, the next version of Ubuntu
[06:36] <[NP] Tangent> but xchat doesn't seem to want to log chats
[06:36] <AndrewCaul> It's being released in June
[06:36] <[NP] Tangent> so I don't know what that command was now
[06:36] <dions> Spec, 3ddesktop is similar to the cube and thats about it.
[06:36] <Spec> hah
[06:36] <Spec> so it's going to die out, as a project, when xgl is even more stable?
[06:36] <stefannnnnnn0000> jo
[06:36] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Can I autojoin the server when I start X-Chat?
[06:37] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - you should go to the documentation site or any search engine an look up setting up a dual boot linux system
[06:37] <McScruff> Dr_Willis, my gnome cant see anything but my kubuntu sees it all
[06:37] <giallu> nobody knows how to install mplayer...
[06:37] <Spec> is microsoft's vista bullshit using directX?
[06:37] <dions> Spec, It will live until xgl becomes the standard.
[06:37] <McScruff> get the deb
[06:37] <[NP] Tangent> spec
[06:37] <Spec> dions: which is hopefully dapper+1 :)
[06:37] <[NP] Tangent> any ideas on what I can do?
[06:37] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, how would I reinstall window? I don't have any discs.
[06:37] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - i think its on the support docs
[06:37] <disinterested_pe> giallu
[06:37] <AndrewCaul> If Windows is still installed, all you have to do is reinstall Windows' bootloader
[06:37] <Spec> [NP] Tangent: Nope, sorry. I suggest looking at the forums if you haven't already.
[06:37] <[NP] Tangent> alright
[06:37] <[NP] Tangent> will do
[06:37] <[NP] Tangent> thanks
[06:37] <Spec> good luck
[06:37] <EcoBlue> AndrewCaul, that partition corrupted.
[06:38] <disinterested_pe> have u installed easyubuntu yet?
[06:38] <giallu> yes?
[06:38] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Can I autojoin the server when I run X-Chat?
[06:38] <EcoBlue> Yes.
[06:38] <Spec> R_a_f_a_E_L: i already told you how to
[06:38] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - get a copy from a friend and then use the license key on your box itself if need be
[06:38] <R_a_f_a_E_L> Sorry, Can you repeat?
[06:38] <R_a_f_a_E_L> I did not see
[06:38] <Spec> R_a_f_a_E_L: in the server window, edit 'freenode' and check "join this server when xchat is started"
[06:38] <AndrewCaul> That sucks
[06:39] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, how would I get a copy for Media Center?
[06:39] <Spec> R_a_f_a_E_L: ctrl+s
[06:39] <Spec> it's 'autoconnect to this network at startup'
=== beyond-rango is now known as beyond
[06:39] <Dr_Willis> xchat has a decent set of docs. :P and a web site with faq's and a HELP menu item :P
[06:39] <Spec> yeah
[06:39] <EcoBlue> Would I just pirate it and then use my License key?
[06:40] <kubuntu_> ecoblue - You either have to ask someone you know to give you a copy of the CD or buy a new one.  If you own the license then you are fine if not you are out of luck.  Media center is crap anyways.  Check out MythTV or Freevo
[06:40] <EcoBlue> I think that's legal...
[06:40] <Spec> What's freevo?
[06:40] <Spec> I mean, apart from the obvious. :p
[06:40] <AndrewCaul> Do you not have an install or recovery disc already?
[06:41] <EcoBlue> kubuntu_, I have the licenese key luckly, I need Media Center for the Xbox 360.
[06:41] <giallu> i don't find the package also if i do apt-cache search...
[06:41] <kubuntu_> spec - its like mythtv
[06:41] <EcoBlue> !mythtv
[06:41] <ubotu> well, mythtv is for watching TV in Linux.  Check out http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/12/16/instructions-to-install-mythtv/
[06:41] <Spec> kubuntu_: How does it compare to mythtv?
[06:41] <Spec> and are hd-capture cards any good yet?
[06:42] <kubuntu_> spec - i favor myth
[06:42] <kubuntu_> spec its all in the choice of hardware

[06:52] <bina> when you use a website address in linux does it cache the DNS response?  if so, how do you update the cahce?
[06:54] <Creteil> hi all
[06:54] <bina> yo
[06:54] <Creteil> someone here can check tapioca with me ?
[06:55] <Creteil> i mean try to use it ...
[06:56] <wims> does anybody know what changes i need to make to my xorg.conf file if i want my desktop to stretch over both my monitors? right now there's one desktop at one monitor and another at my other monitor. I'm using ATI, and the driver is installed properly
[06:57] <Frogzoo> bina: nope - you need to run a dns cache
[06:57] <EcoBlue> I'm talking to compaq right now, hopefully they will help me.
[06:57] <roasty> hm.. is it just me or has xfce started using a lot of gnome stuff?
[06:57] <Bilange> If I changed my hard drive's position (as in: changed from hdb to hda, for example), what changed do I have to make to make ubuntu bootable again?
[06:58] <Bilange> "what changes"*
[06:58] <Frogzoo> Bilange: reinstall grub & update /etc/fstab
[06:58] <Xyloc> Bilange: try chroot
[06:58] <Frogzoo> Bilange: also edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[06:58] <Bilange> Frogzoo:  does editing menu.lst would be enough? i did fstab already
[06:59] <Frogzoo> Bilange: yup - edit menu.lst - then 'update-grub' & cross your fingers
[06:59] <roasty> Bilange: if you replaced your hda, and that's your booting drive, it's going to be harder than just changing files because you have to figure out how to boot to ubuntu (either from a liveCD or from your drive)
[06:59] <Bilange> roasty:  well, ive edited fstab and everythings fine except for grub... ill try Frogzoo's tips
[07:00] <roasty> Bilange: good luck
[07:00] <Dr_Willis>  grub will be messed up.  if you swaped hda and hdb - then the drive is now like hd(1,0) in grub numbering.
[07:00] <Dr_Willis> rember grub starts Numbering drives at 0
[07:00] <Ophiocus> dosent reinstalling grub overwrite menu.lst?
[07:01] <Frogzoo> Ophiocus: nope
[07:01] <Ophiocus> ah,..
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> Ophiocus,  depends on wha tyou mean by 'reinstalling grub' :P
[07:01] <Bilange> Dr_Willis:  theres only one drive implied in all this, hdb goign to hda, and strangely enough menu.lst always had (hd0,0) before AND after i switched the jumpers
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> reinstalling the grub bootloader to the mbr - wont.
[07:01] <Dr_Willis> Bilange,  if you ONLY had 1 drive.. it would be hd0 no matter where its at (i think)
[07:02] <Ophiocus> booting with install cd and skipping all the way to grub install
[07:02] <Frogzoo> Bilange: /boot/grub/device.map
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> grub can be a little... interesting at times.
[07:02] <Dr_Willis> Ophiocus,  thats a little over kill. :P
[07:02] <Bilange> Frogzoo:  whats that? update-grub updated flawlessly, still have to reboot though
[07:02] <Xyloc> Bilange <OPhiocus>, it's possible if you just use expert mode
[07:02] <Ophiocus> i like it rough :P
[07:02] <aro_ron> quick question about booting Ubuntu Live CD... why did mine die so quickly?
[07:03] <aro_ron> I couldnt get past the language selection screen
[07:03] <NoUse> aro_ron probably had some sort of birth defect
[07:03] <Frogzoo> Bilange: maps grub's nomenclature to linux device names
[07:03] <distanceisdeath> the synaptic package manager isnt letting me search...what to do?
[07:03] <aro_ron> haha, yeah... how did you know?
[07:03] <NoUse> aro_ron did it give you any error messages?
[07:03] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: try apt-get instead, works much better
[07:04] <Bilange> anyway, this should work anyways, ill brb (hopefully), thanks :)
[07:04] <distanceisdeath> im searching for  ndis
[07:04] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: Synaptic is riddled with bugs
[07:04] <Dr_Willis> life is riddled with bugs
[07:04] <aro_ron> nope, I wonder if it didnt like my wireless keyboard
[07:04] <distanceisdeath> apt-get ndis?
[07:04] <aro_ron> cause up till that point, it seemed to be loading fine
[07:04] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: I guess u are searching for ndiswrappers?
[07:04] <distanceisdeath> yes
[07:04] <distanceisdeath> i need my usb wireless to work
[07:04] <NoUse> aro_ron did it lock up or reboot or what?
=== rysiek|pl is now known as rysiek|pl|brb
[07:05] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: Try apt-get ndiswrappers, or ndis-wrappers (not sure which)
[07:05] <distanceisdeath> okay
[07:05] <distanceisdeath> is there a sudo in there?
[07:05] <aro_ron> I can only assume it locked up, it came up with the screen to select your language, and the light in the USB reciver started flickering, and it wouldnt let me hit enter
[07:05] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: use sudo with your own pw, unless u installed in expert mode and opted for root to be present.
[07:06] <aro_ron> I have never seen anything like that with a wireless keyboard before
[07:06] <NoUse> aro_ron yeah I'm not sure what happened
[07:06] <NoUse> aro_ron have you used any other live cds?
[07:06] <Xyloc> aro_ron: just Ctrl+Alt+F2 to another term and kill the bugger
[07:07] <distanceisdeath> okay
[07:07] <distanceisdeath> i did that
[07:07] <distanceisdeath> and it asks me for a passwrod
[07:07] <aro_ron> lol, that would be nive, it the keyboard worked at all Xyloc
[07:07] <distanceisdeath> password
[07:07] <aro_ron> nice*
[07:07] <distanceisdeath> but i cant type anything
[07:07] <Xyloc> aro_ron: Just look which process is eating up all your mem with top and kill that process.
[07:08] <aro_ron> Kyloc, are you talking windows, or ubuntu?
[07:08] <Xyloc> aro_ron: Yess..., well try a regular KB first I guess.
[07:08] <aro_ron> xyloc*
[07:08] <distanceisdeath> why wont it let me type a password in the terminal?
[07:08] <Xyloc> aro_ron: You mean to say that you don't have a regular KB somewhere?
[07:09] <aro_ron> I do, I just was hoping I didnt have to dig it out from the pile of junk in here
[07:09] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: On a term you won't see it, but it will be entered,\
[07:09] <distanceisdeath> ohhhh
[07:09] <distanceisdeath> dirty
[07:10] <Xyloc> aro_ron: watch again when people put junk on the street 1 in 4 that there will be a KB included with the junk.
[07:10] <aro_ron> oh and yeah, in case anyone couldnt figure it out, I am a total linux noob right now...
[07:10] <Xyloc> I've seen so many good KB's dumped on the street.
[07:10] <aro_ron> dont worry, I have 3 in the closet Xyloc
[07:10] <octan> can some one help me with a script?
[07:10] <Xyloc> I have 6 of them, though I only bought 1
[07:10] <octan> http://pastebin.com/739674
[07:10] <octan> 1st part works
[07:10] <octan> 2nd not
[07:10] <octan> why?
[07:10] <aro_ron> k, off to reboot...
[07:11] <Xyloc> octan: Whoa, that looks like C...
[07:11] <Xyloc> octan, or is it Bash...?
[07:12] <Xyloc> octan: stupid of me: the title says Bash script...
[07:12] <octan> its bash.. and expect
[07:12] <distanceisdeath> octan

[07:13] <Xyloc> octan, guess what, I;'ve fixed my resolution, thx to richifrich
[07:13] <sameer> wat is happening with irc ?
[07:14] <octan> <Xyloc> nice. but do you got any ideas why the 2nd part doesnt work
[07:14] <sameer> shinu: wat is happening with irc ??
[07:14] <shinu> sameer: what you mean?..

[07:14] <Coca-Cola_MechJo> Hello room!
[07:14] <Coca-Cola_MechJo> Anyone in?
[07:14] <Xyloc> octan, Did you try inserting an echo line in the code so you can see where it stalls?
[07:15] <octan> yes
[07:15] <Xyloc> octan: That's how I debug every script I come across.
[07:15] <Xyloc> octan: Where does it stall? (what line?)
[07:15] <octan> it does not stall.. it just is not inserrting the passhrase correctly
[07:15] <Coca-Cola_MechJo> Cool, If you don't mind me asking? Bow do you burn the Ubuntu Install disk as bootable? The disk I used was given to me and a friend wants it but I can't seem to find the original lol.
[07:15] <shinu> sameer: got the message?
[07:16] <sameer> yeap
[07:16] <sameer> thanx
[07:16] <PB> does anyone here know how to get gentoo?
[07:17] <Xyloc> PB, just go to an ISO site like linuxiso.org
=== PB is now known as pb
[07:17] <rubberduck_sp> Coca-Cola_MechJo, : look for image option in your butning tool, you have to use "burn image " you select the iso and you are done..... if youve got the iso as iso format
[07:17] <pb> huh???
=== pb is now known as jessejester
[07:18] <Coca-Cola_MechJo> Hhhmmm... I used Nero and burned as an ISO data file and it won't boot :( Got any other suggestions?
[07:18] <jessejester> ok
[07:18] <mattikoo> I don't get my sound to be recorded in Dapper. If I record by microphone sound hear from speakers, but playing speakers are muted.
[07:18] <F0LL0W3R> what is the program do the same job like partition magic in windows
[07:18] <Bilange> to whoever who helped me with grub 5 minutes earlier: simply editing menu.lst did the trick.. BUT, strangely update-grub reverted to old non-working defaults (hdb)
[07:19] <sameer> shinu: :(
[07:19] <Xyloc> F0ll0wer: That would be gparted
[07:19] <jessejester> im confused
[07:19] <sameer> shinu: is it ssl
[07:19] <shinu> sameer: yea, only ssl
[07:19] <sameer> grrrr
[07:19] <shinu> sameer: dont tell me you dont use ssl...
[07:19] <F0LL0W3R> <Xyloc> aha thx :)
[07:19] <shinu> sameer: xchat?
[07:19] <sameer> yea
[07:19] <sameer> let me try it with irssi
[07:20] <Xyloc> octan: I'm still thinking about your script...
[07:20] <smaugslayer> anyone play the gnome version of nethack?
[07:20] <jmoncayo> how can i mount an iso file??
[07:20] <rubberduck_sp> i think gparted is way easier than pmagic....
[07:20] <octan> <Xyloc> me too
[07:20] <octan> :)
[07:20] <NoUse> !tell jmoncayo about mountiso
[07:20] <Xyloc> jmoncayo: mount -t iso9660 /dev/hd<x> /media/cdrom
[07:20] <shinu> sameer: highlight my nick please, otherwise i dont see
[07:20] <octan> <Xyloc> its just a snipped of the script.. but its here wher the error is
[07:21] <Frogzoo> smaugslayer: I prefer xnethack - works best
[07:21] <sameer> shinu:  pm ?
[07:21] <shinu> sameer: i dont see your pms
[07:21] <smaugslayer> k, ill try that.  thx

[07:21] <Xyloc> octan: Try saving the output to a veriable and echo it.
[07:22] <javiolo> How do I open rar files in linux ?
[07:22] <Xyloc> octan: where are the differences?
[07:22] <JoaoJoao> I prefer neverwinter nights :)
[07:22] <Xyloc> javiolo: try unrar.
[07:22] <EcoBlue> Woot, Compaq is sending me a recovery CD, that will reinstall Windows XP, so I can dual boot.
[07:22] <Frogzoo> javiolo: either unrar or just let nautilus handle it
[07:22] <AndrewCaul> NetHack seems to work better for me in Windows
[07:22] <AndrewCaul> I can't even figure out how to move.
[07:22] <Xyloc> FrogZoo: yes, Nautilus can do a lot nowadays.
[07:23] <octan> <Xyloc> the thing is that i wanna get rid of that tmp file as you see..
[07:23] <Xyloc> AndrewCaul: Try wasz
[07:23] <javiolo> Frogzoo nautulis doesnt open it
[07:23] <octan> to make things more secure
[07:23] <Frogzoo> javiolo: do you have rar installed?

[07:24] <mike___> Hello everyone, I just rebuilt my PC, I was running Debian for the last 4 years or so, and decided to switch to Ubuntu.  Everything is working good except drop down menus in firefox are fairly slow which gets very annoying (basically when I click a dropdown menu it takes a full second or so to open the dropdown menu)...anyone know why this might be?  I've verified my nvidia drivers, agp status, etc and everything else is lightning quick!
[07:24] <javiolo> Frogzoo dont know
[07:24] <Frogzoo> !ff
[07:24] <ubotu> Frogzoo: Syntax error in line 1. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/

[07:24] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[07:24] <AndrewCaul> Wow. Nautilus can extract RAR files. I didn't even know?
[07:24] <alicia> quiere alguien un chat privado conmigo
[07:24] <Frogzoo> mike___: upgrade ^^^
[07:24] <ompaul> mike___, u going with 5.10 or dapper?
[07:24] <mike___> upgrade what?
[07:24] <mike___> I'm on 5.10
[07:24] <mike___> and i switched to XFCE4
[07:24] <Frogzoo> mike___: upgrade ff to 1.5
[07:25] <mike___> firefox is already upgraded :)
[07:25] <Tallia1Kubuntu> i just downloaded Poseidon from the net in VCD format, it's divided in 2 cds, each with a couple of .bin/.cue files, how can i playe the movie?
[07:25] <mike___> actually, let me take that back...
[07:25] <javiolo> Frogzoo how do I get it ?
[07:25] <mike___> firefox upgraded via synaptic but it still shows itself as 1.0.8...weird...how do i get it to upgrade in ubuntu? :)
[07:25] <NoUse> Tallia1Kubuntu you can install k3b and burn it to a CD
[07:25] <Xyloc> brb
[07:26] <Tallia1Kubuntu> NoUse: can't i avoid that?
[07:26] <Frogzoo> javiolo: sudo apt-get install unrar-nonfree
[07:26] <ompaul> mike___, well I would wait for 5 days for dapper to be released but that is just me :-)

[07:26] <Frogzoo> mike___: see pm from ubotu
[07:26] <mike___> 5 days...lol looks like i picked a silly time to upgrade - does apt-get in ubuntu work just like debian - i can just change the "tree" to dapper and it will get all the new packages?
[07:27] <Tallia1Kubuntu> NoUse: playing the directly the .bin movie?
[07:27] <mike___> ah ok thanks Frogzoo

[07:28] <EvilGuru> I am interested in upgrading to dapper drake from 5.10 (breezy) what is the easiest way to do this?
[07:28] <shinu> sameer: uh... no clue >_<
[07:28] <Frogzoo> EvilGuru: wait to june 1
[07:28] <mike___> Frogzoo: when dapper comes out, can i just modify /etc/apt/sources.list and change all the "breezy"s to "dapper"s and run something like apt-get dist-upgrade?
[07:28] <ompaul> EvilGrin, as Frogzoo said, or go to #ubuntu+1
[07:29] <Frogzoo> mike___: yep
[07:29] <mike___> coolness
[07:29] <AndrewCaul> Yeah. Just wait a couple days.
[07:29] <ompaul> mike___, we have a tool for that  :)
[07:29] <mike___> oh yeah? neat, whats it called :)
[07:29] <mike___> im still in old-school debian mode
[07:29] <Mysta_> hey, is there a listing of what gets installed when choosing a server install as oppose to a regular install???

[07:29] <rubberduck_sp> I think its better to wait... in some days dapper will be here... and it will be stable.... well
[07:29] <ompaul> mike___, shame on me I can't remember :-) upgrade-manager or something
[07:30] <Mysta_> or is it that X doesn't get installed and thats it?
[07:30] <Frogzoo> ompaul: does the tool do anything extra apart from changing the repos & apt-get dist-upgrade?
[07:31] <ompaul> mike___, sudo update-manager -d << :-)
[07:31] <roryy> Mysta_: fairly minimal install, iirc. something like the 'ubuntu-minimal' package in breezy (this is from memory, possibly incorrect).
[07:31] <mike___> ah sweet
[07:31] <Wespe> hi, is it possible to find the IPs i am currently connected to?
[07:31] <ompaul> Frogzoo, well its in zenity and stuff like that - so yes and no
[07:31] <ompaul> Frogzoo, allows you choose stuff as far as I can see
[07:31] <roryy> Wespe: applications -> system tools -> network tools, then 'netstat' tab
[07:32] <ompaul> Wespe, netstat -a | more if your a command line user
[07:32] <mike___> hmmm, new distribution release '6.06 LTS' is available :D  I assume I should wait until that says something about dapper?
[07:33] <Frogzoo> Wespe: netstat -ant      or lsof (with flags)
[07:33] <bina> when you use a website address in linux does it cache the DNS response?  if so, how do you update the cahce?  Sorry, I think someone responded but its gone off my screen
[07:33] <Wespe> thanx
[07:33] <roryy> mike___: 6.06 is dapper's 'official' name
[07:33] <mike___> ah gotcha
[07:33] <interprb> sorry but i need major help with an dns issue.  1st. my web server is requesting an "a" record request to an un wanted domain. 2nd i have firestarter on server w/ port 80 open. everytime i "lock" and "unlock" webserver with  firestarter i get that damn "a" request  in dns logs to that un wanted domain.
[07:33] <AndrewCaul> 6.06 is Dapper.
[07:33] <roryy> actually, the 'network tools' netstat is not so great
=== gordonjcp is now known as bigkevmcjcp
[07:34] <Frogzoo> interprb: at a guess, is the ip entered in firestarter's lists?
[07:34] <interprb> no
[07:35] <ompaul> mike___, think sarge and what number - same idea
[07:35] <mike___> ah yes, makes more sense
[07:35] <interprb> i found this by locking and unlocking fw messin around...
[07:35] <mike___> Guess I'll wait until the official release then and upgrade at that time
[07:35] <ompaul> mike___, however the numbers are Year Month of release
[07:35] <Frogzoo> interprb: why is this a MAJOR problem?
[07:36] <interprb> we dont use hotmail
[07:37] <Frogzoo> interprb: you running a mail server?
[07:37] <interprb> yes but not on web server
[07:38] <Frogzoo> interprb: try ethereal & see if it gives you a better idea what's generating it
[07:39] <Frogzoo> interprb: maybe grep you web pages for the ip/address...
[07:39] <interprb> i have and i doesn't show i caught this with live dns logs

[07:41] <alicia> hola

[07:48] <Some_Person> will it ask me for the driver?
[07:48] <roryy> Some_Person: iirc, it will
[07:48] <molinero> roryy relax
[07:48] <Some_Person> so all i do is go to a command line and type in sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[07:48] <ompaul> Some_Person, yes and then you choose vesa when the card list comes up
[07:48] <Frogzoo> interprb: well, one option would be build a new machine, & move your data over

[07:50] <sebast> I have used Galeon a few times before
[07:50] <ompaul> Frogzoo, why not have an alias auto replace for ff1.5 when you type ff(space) in your client?
[07:51] <sebast> Frogzoo:  I am quite a Linux noob so I don't know what I need to do.
[07:51] <other> TallialKubuntu our Firefox did that because we did not have flash. try installing the flash plugin if you do not have it

[07:54] <uzume> hi all
[07:54] <ompaul> sebast, have you added "closed source drivers" ?
[07:54] <Frogzoo> sebast: I doubt a fsck will fix it - but you can give it a go - start considering a reinstall, also maybe your disk is dying

[07:56] <ompaul> sebast, ohh the likes of video stuff and so on, adding them in from outside, do a df -h and put the output into paste.ubuntu-nl.org and let us have a look
[07:56] <sebast> when I boot UBuntu after it tells me that there is erros with the file system.  and has tryed to do a check.  it mounts the root file system as read only
[07:56] <sebast> and I get like a command prompt thing
[07:57] <sebast> well it scrwed up on me when I was going to whatch a video I downloaded
[07:58] <Frogzoo> sebast: you'd be best to boot the live cd - & run fsck on the root filesystem while it's unmounted
[07:58] <sebast> Linux nob.  so boot the Live CD and in the shell do what?
[07:58] <sebast> noob not nob
[07:59] <uzume> actually i have the 2 screens active but when I play a video only my laptop screen is playing it, on the other screen i have my player with no image :'(
[07:59] <Frogzoo> sebast: fsck -a /dev/hdxy       where xy is the root filesystem

[08:12] <AlexExtreme> hello
[08:12] <AndrewCaul> You could try Cedega.
[08:12] <``alexandra17> sebast : with cedega .. i know .. but is not free
[08:12] <sebast> distanceisdeath:  wireless and Linux :(  hard wired is best
[08:13] <sebast> yes, but you can download one that you have to configure alandra17u
[08:13] <distanceisdeath> i know

[08:13] <StAnLeY^> ompaul: so form what directory should I download the iso from ?
[08:13] <ompaul> ``alexandra17, that is a matter between you and the games maker, if they made a version for Ubuntu you would not have to deal with cedega
[08:13] <``alexandra17> with cvs ?
[08:13] <sebast> wireless sucks and hardwired is best.  can you get it hard wired?
[08:13] <AlexExtreme> i just installed the Ubuntu 6.06 RC, and one thing i noticed with Espresso is that it doesn't prompt you if you want to install GRUB when there are other operating systems installed. The old text installer did this

[08:15] <distanceisdeath> i took windows off
[08:15] <ompaul> !tell distanceisdeath about ndiswrapper
[08:15] <Xyloc> joe: Yes, just download the binary from the Mozilla.com website
[08:15] <NoUse> !tell joe_ about ff1.5
[08:15] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, just do what the bot told ya
[08:15] <sebast> ndiswrapper I messed around with that myself in the past with Fedora Core,  but coudn't get my wireless to work so
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> yeah im doing that tutorial
[08:16] <Xyloc> joe_: Just unpack it in your homedir and let the default shortcut on your panel point to firefox.sh
[08:16] <distanceisdeath> but im stuck on 2.2 set up and install
[08:16] <sebast> well if you are screwed
[08:16] <sebast> and
[08:16] <sebast> it won't work
[08:16] <sebast> with Linux
[08:16] <sebast> well
[08:16] <lerch> How do I swith user in nautilus when connected to a remote server through ssh?

[08:16] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.

[08:17] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, there are 9 steps in that which step are you having issues with?
[08:17] <sebast> if you carn't get your wireless working with Linux with ndiswrapper or some other program.  you have two optsions
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> 2.2
[08:17] <YazzY> howdy
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> okay
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> its okay sebast..i have another hard drive with windows on it
[08:17] <distanceisdeath> i jsut have to switch them out
[08:17] <sebast> you can buy some other wireless tha works with it or.  install Windows and have Linux inside that.
[08:18] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, okay I say it again there are 9 steps there  - which one is it that you are having problems with?
[08:18] <YazzY> i was wondering how one could change keybindings with kubuntu, i cannot find any menu application dealing with it
[08:18] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: If you removed the Windows loader from the MBR, just type fdisk /mbr
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> whats your other irc channel??
[08:18] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: Mind you, this WILL delete grub or lilo, so watch out!
[08:18] <distanceisdeath> what will?
[08:19] <sebast> distanceisdeath:  you can install Linux inside Windows with VMware player or VMware workstation.  and then LInux will use Windows to connect to the net.
[08:19] <stjepan> I want to remove ubuntu gnome stuff from my system and I want to install XFCE
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> windows is fine
[08:19] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: fdisk /mbr will kill any residing boot manager as it restores the MBR to its previous state
[08:19] <stjepan> any recommendations?
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> im not dualbooting
[08:19] <stjepan> suggestions?
[08:19] <ompaul> #ubuntu-ie
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> i have two hard drives
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> both are master
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> so i cant connect together
[08:19] <distanceisdeath> and i dont feel like making it work
[08:20] <distanceisdeath> so i just switch them ouit
[08:20] <distanceisdeath> out
[08:20] <sebast> you caan install
[08:20] <sebast> LInux inside Windows in a virtual machine as they are called
[08:20] <Xyloc> distanceisdeath: Just select the active partition in Linux fdisk. (The Windows fdisk will mess up your bootloader)
[08:20] <sebast> stejepan:  you can find XFCE in the package manager I Think.  or you got to add the resporitory for it
[08:20] <distanceisdeath> wait guys
[08:21] <YazzY> so guys, any chance you know how to change keybinding in kubuntu ?
[08:21] <sebast> YazzY:  this is the ubntu channel try
[08:21] <serp> YazzY: ask kubuntu questions in #kubuntu
[08:21] <sebast> try #kubuntu
[08:21] <lerch> When I ssh to my work I use the command "gowww" to swith user once connected. How can I do the similar thing in Nautilus?
[08:21] <Xyloc> YazzY: I agree, switch -> #kubuntu

[08:26] <sebast> Bluefox:  http://www.jfgi.us
[08:26] <paradizelost> anyone used realvnc4 from their site on ubuntu?
[08:26] <Bluefox_> sebast:  i tried the help file already, it wasn't helpful.
[08:26] <ompaul> stjepan, not really though you can use a sever install before you do anything else but if you install xfce you can leave it there if you have the disk space
[08:26] <Xyloc> stjepan: Yes, but I recommend doing it by killall gdm and after that remove it with apt-get

[08:26] <paradizelost> dextroso: as in the scroller?
[08:26] <stjepan> Xyloc, but the gnome package is not installed o_O
[08:27] <paradizelost> eshowl: sh filename.run
[08:27] <Bluefox_> "You don't do it with regular text; I haven't found a way to do that, at least. But you can do it with a text box."
[08:27] <dextroso> yes
[08:27] <Bluefox_> in other words, you can't vertically center PAGE CONTENT like in microsoft word format page -> vertical alignment = center
[08:27] <paradizelost> dextroso: you need to enable ChordMiddle in your xorg.conf
[08:27] <ompaul> dextroso, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose the right option - btw it defaults to what is there at the moment
[08:27] <eshowl> paradizelost, thanks let me try it now
[08:27] <Xyloc> stjepan: In that case, just delete the src or the binaries...\
[08:27] <paradizelost> dextroso: follow ompaul's instructions
[08:27] <ompaul> Bluefox_, with what package?
[08:27] <m00se> hi guys

[08:28] <paradizelost> damn that's one long link
[08:28] <Xyloc> stjepan It's a lot though and you risk breaking a lot of packages this way
[08:28] <sebast> try the Open Office forum?

[08:30] <Xyloc> stjepan: If you could remove evrything but the runtime libraries, that might be safe
=== ScottK2 is now known as ScottK
[08:30] <stjepan> Xyloc, apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or xfce4?
[08:30] <PyroticShadow> anyone know how to convert a .flac to .mp3...................>>?
[08:30] <AndrewCaul> !xfce
[08:30] <ubotu> from memory, xfce is a lightweight Desktop Environment that uses GTK. to install, "sudo apt-get install xfce4" or "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop". http://www.xfce.org/
[08:31] <Xyloc> stjepan: I'd go for the second one, but honestly I don't know for sure
[08:31] <Xyloc> ubotu: Nice bot!
[08:31] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Xyloc
[08:31] <ompaul> Bluefox_, sorry just reading your stuff this is what I think you want to do: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14680 if you have an example I may be able to find out how to do it
[08:32] <Xyloc> I have to make some physical grub right now ;-)
[08:32] <paradizelost> ubotu: nice bod
[08:32] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, paradizelost
[08:32] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  Nope.
[08:32] <paradizelost> ubotu: nice bot
[08:32] <ubotu> well, nice bot is Thankyou
[08:32] <Frogzoo> paradizelost: freudian slip
[08:33] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  Type "My text" and it's 3.5 inches down the page.  Hit enter, and "My text" moves up to 3.0 inches, with the next line starting below that.  Hit enter again and the text moves up a bit more.
[08:33] <paradizelost> Frogzoo: yah, i'm hot for the bot
[08:33] <Frogzoo> lol
[08:33] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  Result is an equal amount of non-content exists above and below the content of the page, as is the case with File::Page Setup -> Alignment = Vertical on Microsoft Word.
[08:34] <ompaul> Bluefox_, fine leave that with me for a few minutes
[08:34] <vliedels> I have a problem with booting with ubuntu. It starts booting, installing and then stops at: "retrieving netcfg" with error msg: "there was a prob reading data from cd-rom, failed to copy file from cd-rom". Anyone knows what i can do about it??
[08:34] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  I've used google, the help file, fiddled with Format::Page, and have a forum post I'm waiting on, also asked in #openoffice.org .  Kudos if you find something, nobody else seems to.
[08:35] <paradizelost> vliedels: sounds like a bad burn to me
[08:35] <issaker> HEEEELP!
[08:35] <Bluefox_> (this was an important task to perform to get my Word Expert certification on Microsoft Word 2000)
[08:35] <vliedels> paradizelost tried with 3 cd's
[08:35] <vliedels> all stop at the same point
[08:35] <NoUse> !tell issaker about helpme
[08:35] <paradizelost> vliedels: burned on the exact same machine that you are using them on?
[08:36] <issaker> oh
[08:36] <midnight-> Question: We're using ubuntu 5.10.  Machines need to have working modems.  Is there a PCI modem that works without effort in ubuntu.  One with a non-commercial driver.
[08:36] <vliedels> paradizelost no
[08:36] <distanceisdeath> how to connec to the insternet using a pci card?
[08:36] <issaker> why wouldnt ubuntu see my SATAII drive?
[08:36] <Frogzoo> issaker: you'll do better just saying what your problem is
[08:36] <vliedels> burned on this pc, tried to boot on other pc
[08:36] <distanceisdeath> connect*
[08:36] <paradizelost> vliedels: when a cd burner starts going bad, discs can be read in it, and a select few other drives, i have a burner going out, and i have to use a different burner
[08:36] <paradizelost> try burning it in a different burner or in the same machine you are installing on
[08:36] <issaker> i have 2 HD, one on IDE2, one on SATAII
[08:36] <Frogzoo> issaker: ubuntu should see it as /dev/sda
[08:36] <issaker> as what?
[08:36] <vliedels> hmm same machine will be a problem :P
[08:37] <issaker> this is at install
[08:37] <vliedels> but isn't it strange that it stops at the same point 3 times?
[08:37] <issaker> at the partitioing screen, i cant see my SATA drive
[08:37] <paradizelost> vliedels: no, the burner is going bad.
[08:37] <paradizelost> it's corrupting the disc
[08:37] <vliedels> hm
[08:37] <paradizelost> the ISO is probably fine
[08:37] <mlalkaka> midnight-: Lucent winmodems work. i have a lucent modem on 5.10. although i don't use it on a regular basis, it has worked without problems whenever i have used it
[08:37] <paradizelost> i had a dozen bad burns from my burner, that all worked fine in the burner itself
[08:37] <Frogzoo> !linmodem
[08:37] <ubotu> well, linmodem is To get started with linmodems (aka winmodems), see http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
[08:38] <ompaul> Bluefox_, if I don't I will be meeting an OOo dev on Monday or Tuesday so that can be a matter for conversation
[08:38] <vliedels> ow and paradizelost burning it on a cd-rw is ok? don't want to spend all my cd's on failed cd's :x
[08:38] <paradizelost> vliedels: as long as it's a 700mb cdrw, yah should be
[08:39] <issaker> frogzoo, do you know what the problem is
[08:39] <midnight-> mlalkaka: Hmmmm seems to me that our stock modem is lucent based but it didn't appear to work.  We don't build too many machines that use modems so I'm out of practice using a modem in linux
[08:39] <vliedels> ok
[08:39] <paradizelost> vliedels: but don't burn w/ that burner anymore and expect the discs to be fine in other machines
[08:39] <vliedels> thnx
[08:39] <paradizelost> you did of course check the md5 of the iso image right?
[08:39] <Frogzoo> issaker: I would think it would see it...
[08:39] <Some_Person> I finally have Ubuntu set up
[08:39] <vliedels> yeah i'll try burning at another pc
[08:39] <issaker> oh =/
[08:39] <mlalkaka> midnight-: just a sec. i'll try to find out what model my lucent modem is
[08:39] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  Interesting.
[08:40] <issaker> i have a windows partition on that drive, would that be why?
[08:40] <Some_Person> But Ubuntu can't use my sound card and modem!
[08:40] <Bluefox_> ompaul:  I am going to go apply for a Network+ certificate at college, I'll check the bugzilla on OOo when I get back and file an entry if nothing comes up.
=== lars-ut-away is now known as lars-ut
[08:40] <NoUse> issaker no, have you tried a live cd?
[08:40] <mlalkaka> midnight-: do you know how i can find some detailed info about a pci modem?
[08:40] <Some_Person> And why can only root - which i cant log on to - access my ntfs partition?
[08:41] <issaker> live CD doesnt work, i get x server errors
[08:41] <Frogzoo> !tell mlalkaka about linmodem
[08:41] <Bluefox_> Some_Person: modem doesn't surprise me.  Nobody has a real modem, they have an RJ-11 port and software to emulate a modem.
[08:41] <distanceisdeath> how do you connect to the internet using a pci card?
[08:41] <midnight-> I"ve been on the linmodem website
[08:41] <midnight-> which is a good one
[08:41] <vliedels> hmm no i didn't check the hash
[08:41] <paradizelost> !root
[08:41] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[08:41] <paradizelost> Some_Person: you may need to add the user option to your fstab
[08:41] <vliedels> but don't know what is was anymore
[08:41] <paradizelost> !ntfs
[08:41] <ubotu> ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
[08:41] <midnight-> I was just hoping someone could give me a brand name and a driver name and off I'd go.
[08:41] <AndrewCaul> Some_Person: Can what does your fstab file look like?
[08:41] <NoUse> issaker switch to a terminal on the installer by hitting Ctrl+Alt+F2 and then type 'fdisk -l /dev/sda'
[08:42] <midnight-> Which of course is taking the lazy way out.

[08:44] <Some_Person> so i dont know

[08:44] <paradizelost> Some_Person: it wouldn't do it automatically unless you told it where to mount it on install

[09:04] <distanceisdeath> earthen...it came with an installation cd...would the drivers be on there?
[09:04] <paradizelost> scenestar: why are you having them do the -v?
[09:04] <paradizelost> it adds a lot of extra crap

[09:05] <scenestar> errr
[09:05] <Aeudian> ompaul: i dont have a gui
[09:05] <scenestar> modprobe the module
[09:05] <earthen> distanceisdeath,  you should only need the .ini file if i'm not mistakes

[09:06] <IngTh0rndike> hello yall
[09:07] <Aeudian> ompaul: server no gui installed =P
[09:07] <gnomefreak> thats not the one i thought of
[09:07] <gnomefreak> lol
[09:07] <ompaul> Aeudian, therefore the second part of that last command :-)
=== bobbyd is now known as bigbobbydmcd
[09:08] <earthen> distanceisdeath, yeah I made a mistake you need the .inf file
=== nalioth is now known as noirequus
[09:08] <ompaul> Aeudian, you don't seriously think I would not answer the question to the best of my ability ;-)

[09:09] <ompaul> Aeudian, now your just being tricky just a min :-)
[09:09] <earthen> distanceisdeath, I made a mistake you need the .inf file not the .ini
[09:09] <IngTh0rndike> ompaul, thx
[09:09] <earthen> distanceisdeath, sorry about that
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> its cool
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> i got all i believe'
[09:10] <Rubin> anyone have a favorite RSS feed for finding out about software vulnerabliities in a minimalistic way?
[09:10] <Aeudian> ompaul: sry this linux server is driving me up the wall
[09:10] <distanceisdeath> haha
[09:10] <Rubin> i am using sans, but their updates dont RSS well
[09:11] <ompaul> Aeudian, I have a fair bit of info for you please message me so I can reply on one screen
[09:11] <earthen> distanceisdeath, ok in a root terminal you need to type as root "ndiswrapper -i (path and name of the inffile)
[09:11] <earthen> distanceisdeath, this will load the driver
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> earthen
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> i put them on the desktop
[09:11] <distanceisdeath> what would be the path?
[09:12] <ompaul> Aeudian, 'lo
[09:12] <ompaul> !enter
[09:12] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[09:12] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, ^^ up two lines
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> what paul?
[09:12] <earthen> distanceisdeath, should be /home/your username/Desktop
[09:12] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:12] <Firezip_> Guys can you help me with getting sound to work in Nexuiz?
[09:13] <Aeudian> ompaul: im confused !enter do?
[09:13] <earthen> distanceisdeath, if you just cd into the destop in the terminal you will not have to type the path
[09:13] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, not only does your nick rob the left of the screen so much real estate, but now your hitting enter when you have not made your point, please gather all your info and type it at once :-)
[09:13] <lukaswayne9> Is the keystroke for restarting X alt-ctrl-backspace?
[09:13] <VR_> can anyone help? im trying to use abcde, the cd ripper. whenever i insert a cd, and launch abcde, i get this > vr@mephisto:~$ abcde
[09:14] <VR_> cd-discid: /dev/cdrom: CDROMREADTOCHDR: Input/output error
[09:14] <VR_> [ERROR]  abcde: CD could not be read. Perhaps there's no CD in the drive?
[09:14] <claint> lukaswayne9 : no, that is the keystroke for killing X. if gdm is running it will restart.
[09:14] <emdash> i've got ubuntu 5.10 on an old graphite clamshell ibook. x11 seems a bit messed up, the red and blue channels are swapped
[09:14] <distanceisdeath> haha okay ompaul
=== Rondom_ is now known as Rondom
[09:14] <lukaswayne9> claint is shift-backspace a keystroke?
[09:15] <emdash> has anyone had that issue with x11 before? i'm using the fbdev driver for x11 in 24bpp mode
[09:15] <emdash> the laptop has an ati rage mobile gpu
[09:16] <Firezip_> Can anybody help me get my sound working in Nexuiz?
[09:16] <NoUse> !tell Firezip_ about sound
[09:16] <ompaul> emdash, you really should not have to use fbdev try >>sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<< and try ati or vesa
[09:16] <earthen> distanceisdeath, you can also "apt-get ndiswrapper-utils" that will give you a gui to install the drivers in case you wanted something like that
[09:17] <paradizelost> shift+backspace is a way to kill Xgl if you don't change your keymapping
[09:17] <Firezip_> thanks NoUse
[09:17] <NoUse> Firezip_ np
[09:18] <kbrooks> is Ubuntu 6.06 ut yet?
[09:18] <distanceisdeath> earthen
[09:18] <paradizelost> !ubuntu
[09:18] <ubotu> rumour has it, ubuntu is a free GNU/Linux distribution. More at http://www.ubuntu.com and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MarkShuttleworth
[09:18] <ompaul> !dapper
[09:18] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[09:18] <earthen> distanceisdeath,  yes!
[09:19] <distanceisdeath> haha...it just gives me a list of options.
[09:19] <menglef> hello, might anyone have an awnser as to the mysterious adsl via sbc/yahoo problem?
[09:20] <earthen> distanceisdeath, ok do "cd /home/distanceisdeath/Desktop"
[09:20] <paradizelost> menglef: must be mysterious, i've never heard of it
[09:20] <distanceisdeath> okay...
[09:20] <distanceisdeath> i put them into a folder....so who i bring it to that folder? or still the dektop?
[09:20] <pike__> menglef: sbc/yahoo.. their tech support is always fun :)
[09:20] <earthen> distanceisdeath, you .inf file is there on your desktop right
[09:20] <AndrewCaul> "rumour has it, ubuntu is a free GNU/Linux distribution." :)
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> nah i put it in the folder...but i added that into the path
[09:21] <earthen> distanceisdeath,  ok then cd into the folder also
[09:21] <menglef> paradizelost: it has to do with pppoeconf not being able to find the 'access concentrator'
[09:21] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:21] <cvasilak> hello there what is the name of the package that installs the SMP kernel for dapper drake?
[09:21] <ismael> what repository should I put for haven't this error "libidn11 (>= 0.5.18) but 0.5.13-1.0 is to be installed" II have a ubuntu breezy  distribution
=== s|k is now known as Telamonian
[09:21] <paradizelost> menglef: hmm.  those 2 would have a funky problem...
[09:22] <earthen> distanceisdeath,  what type of wifi card do you have by the way
[09:22] <ismael> libidn11 (>= 0.5.18) but 0.5.13-1.0 is to be installed
[09:22] <ismael> what repository should I put for haven't this error "libidn11 (>= 0.5.18) but 0.5.13-1.0 is to be installed" II have a ubuntu breezy  distribution
=== Telamonian is now known as s|k
[09:22] <paradizelost> ismael: please stop spammin
[09:22] <simonpca> plop
[09:23] <menglef> paradizelost: even google has not helped, i may call tech support but i read some scary tales
[09:23] <paradizelost> menglef: i doubt that tech support will get you anywhere, most places only "officially" support windows
[09:23] <ismael> sorry
[09:24] <menglef> paradizelost: yes i read that, is there any odd software which might be able to configure this? besides pppoeconf?
[09:24] <Who_> ismael: 1. you are spamming again
[09:24] <Drake_> what would be the reason for two instances of /usr/sbin/smbd? That is the samba daemon, isn't it?
[09:24] <Who_> ismael: apologies, I am not so clever!
[09:24] <distanceisdeath> earhten...its saying there is not directory
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> cd /home/distance/desktop
[09:25] <paradizelost> menglef: you could just get a linksys or something and dmz the linux box...
[09:25] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: desktop needs a CAPITAL  D -  Desktop
[09:25] <earthen> distanceisdeath, desktop starts with a upper case D
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> and its a d link pci card
[09:25] <distanceisdeath> what about home?
[09:25] <earthen> small h for home
[09:25] <Who_> ismael: It is in the Dapper drake repositories, but that is a newer version of Ubuntu than you have - it is likely that it will mean you need to update a _lot_ of files
[09:26] <Drake_> linksys WRT's are beautiful with OpenWRT on them
[09:26] <paradizelost> Drake_: i prefer dd-wrt
[09:26] <paradizelost> prettier/easier to use interface
[09:26] <paradizelost> and still have the option to SSH into it
[09:27] <emdash> ompaul: i could not get it to work with ati
[09:27] <paradizelost> i actually went and set up a virtual interface at my office, i set up SBS servers, and they need to be in their own subnet
[09:27] <emdash> ompaul: it would gripe something about not reading vbios
[09:28] <Drake_> with OpenWRT you can have very explict iptables, snort, or anything else you want running on your gateway/router
[09:28] <earthen> distanceisdeath, "cd /home/distance/Desktop/folder"
[09:28] <distanceisdeath> all right earthen
[09:28] <Xyloc> Bye everyone, I'm going out to dinner :-)
[09:28] <distanceisdeath> i was capitalizingmy name
[09:29] <distanceisdeath> have fun xyloc
[09:29] <paradizelost> Drake_: this is true, but it's all by hand, i haven't seen a nice web management interface for openwrt yet
[09:29] <earthen> distanceisdeath, ok if you do "ls" command do you see the .inf file
[09:29] <paradizelost> unless there's one you know of...
[09:29] <ompaul> emdash, and how about vesa?
[09:30] <distanceisdeath> yes earthen
[09:30] <earthen> distanceisdeath, if you can tell me the name of the file
[09:30] <distanceisdeath> prismnic.inf
[09:31] <distanceisdeath> in caps though
[09:31] <earthen> distanceisdeath, then type or cut and past this command "sudo ndiswrapper -i prismnic.inf"
[09:31] <tuxtheslacker> .clear
[09:31] <tuxtheslacker> hello.
[09:31] <distanceisdeath> does it matter?? lowercase or capital?
[09:31] <Derami1> is there a way to modify the grid on the desktop that icons snap to?
[09:32] <earthen> distanceisdeath, yes
[09:32] <tuxtheslacker> did everyone see that google released picasa for linux?
[09:32] <distanceisdeath> well the file name is capital
[09:32] <earthen> distanceisdeath, Linux is allway case sensitive
[09:32] <distanceisdeath> so
[09:32] <earthen> distanceisdeath, ok then put cap
[09:32] <distanceisdeath> sudo ndiswrapper -i PRISMNIC.INF
[09:33] <earthen> distanceisdeath, get in the habbit of using the "TAb key when typing files
[09:33] <distanceisdeath> when i press i see peoples name
[09:33] <paradizelost> distanceisdeath: tab completion is your friend....
[09:33] <kocodomo> hello
[09:33] <earthen> distanceisdeath, you got that right
[09:34] <janusday> My system does not start X by default. How do I enable X by default?
[09:34] <mlalkaka> midnight-: i think i have a simple solution. i've posted it at http://mlalkaka.pastebin.com/739922.
[09:34] <earthen> distanceisdeath, mmm I don't know whay you should be seeing people names
[09:34] <tuxtheslacker> janusday, start it in init 5
[09:34] <thanasis> earthen, cause he is using the TAB in his IRC client
[09:34] <distanceisdeath> earthen
[09:34] <earthen> thanasis, LOL
[09:34] <ompaul> earthen, the difference between irc and terminal :-)
[09:34] <distanceisdeath> it says installing pri.........
[09:34] <thanasis> :)
[09:35] <simonpca> earthen: you type the first caracters, then TAB
[09:35] <distanceisdeath> then it gives me control on the command line again
[09:35] <crazy_penguin> could some one tell if the apache package for ubuntu is preconfigurated to a certain level or it is raw (factory configurated)?
[09:35] <earthen> distanceisdeath, use tab i mean in your ternimal while typing root commands
[09:35] <distanceisdeath> oh
[09:35] <distanceisdeath> haha
[09:35] <tuxtheslacker> earthen, u can use tab for every user, not just root.
[09:36] <janusday> tuxtheslacker, Do you mean setting the default runlevel to 5?
[09:36] <earthen> tuxtheslacker,  yes i know but I trying not to be to confising for distanceisdeath
[09:36] <ompaul> crazy_penguin, iirc it has the www changed but that is it - like the machine points not to apache-2/. but the directory below that
[09:36] <Derami1> is there any way to modify the grid on the desktop that icons snap to?
[09:36] <distanceisdeath> yeah distance
[09:36] <tuxtheslacker> earthen, oh okay :-D
[09:36] <tuxtheslacker> Janusday: yupperz
[09:36] <Drake_> must have been lagged
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> welll what now earthen...it says installing....but i have command line again.....and it doesnt say finshed or anything
[09:37] <ompaul> janusday, its 2 in debian systems :-) N 2
[09:37] <earthen> distanceisdeath, thats a good thing
[09:37] <janusday> tuxtheslacker, I've tried that - but it doesn't seem to work
[09:37] <ompaul> janusday, 0126
[09:37] <tuxtheslacker> ompaul, seems to have it :-)
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> okay good!!
[09:37] <earthen> distanceisdeath, now do "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
[09:37] <distanceisdeath> one sec
[09:38] <earthen> distanceisdeath, after that if you are lucky it should work
[09:38] <janusday> ompaul, I don't understand, please explain - I already have it set to runlevel 2
[09:38] <tuxtheslacker> janusday, I'm coming out of slackware background, debian is a little different as you can imagine :-)
[09:38] <emdash> ompaul: vesa does not appear as an option
[09:38] <ompaul> earthen, are you the man in the ice country?
[09:38] <truz_`24> what tool are we using to edit hex values in a file?
[09:38] <Frogzoo> !tell tuxtheslacker about docs
[09:38] <distanceisdeath> all right earthen
[09:38] <ompaul> emdash, your using - ppc?
[09:38] <distanceisdeath> it should work?
[09:38] <earthen> ompaul, yes sir I am, long time no talk
[09:38] <emdash> ompaul: yes
[09:38] <ompaul> earthen, :-)
[09:39] <janusday> tuxtheslacker, Yes, i know, I've been slacking as well
[09:39] <crazy_penguin> ompaul: that's not preciselly what i want to know. i want to know if the package/apache is comes preconfigurated like in mandriva or other such distros so you don't need to configurate it from the ground level.
[09:39] <ompaul> emdash, the instruction I gave was based on x86 - hmm
[09:39] <tuxtheslacker> janusday, :-P
[09:39] <Drake_> why would two instances of /usr/sbin/smbd -D be running as root? that is the samba daemon, isn't it?
[09:39] <earthen> distanceisdeath, try loking for wifi networs by going to System -> Administration -> Networking
[09:39] <thanasis> earthen, with no offence to distanceisdeath, i admire your patience !!!
[09:39] <tuxtheslacker> janusday, I have to say overall, I'm very please with ubuntu in comparison.
[09:40] <Frogzoo> Drake_: it's normal
[09:40] <ompaul> crazy_penguin, well I had it up and running doing virtual sites in 10 minutes,
[09:40] <tuxtheslacker> it's not slow as dog menor like fedora, and it's easy to manage unlike slackware.
[09:40] <distanceisdeath> im a noob
[09:40] <earthen> thanasis, LOL thank you I'm use to it I work at a school so I do this every day
[09:40] <janusday> ompaul, is it some permissions you apply?
[09:40] <crazy_penguin> ompaul: ok. thx :)
[09:40] <janusday> ompaul, I did not understand your last message
[09:40] <gnomnain> hello
[09:40] <thanasis> distanceisdeath, everyone used to be sometime noobs, so don't feel bad
[09:41] <firestorm> Hello, I want to set up a directory that users can create new directorys, files etc.. yet retain the permission of the main directory; is their a way to do this?
[09:41] <distanceisdeath> WOOHOO
[09:41] <distanceisdeath> it says it has to be configured
[09:41] <distanceisdeath> thats easy right?
[09:41] <ompaul> janusday, I was saying the only valid runlevels in debian / Ubuntu are 0 1 2 6
[09:41] <tuxtheslacker> since when are students known as n00bs? we're all here to learn, so we're all in some way a n00b :-P
[09:41] <earthen> distanceisdeath, Should be
[09:41] <janusday> ompaul, oh, now I see
[09:41] <earthen> distanceisdeath, LOL
[09:41] <thanasis> tuxtheslacker, i totally agree with you
[09:42] <Frogzoo> firestorm: look at sticky bit for directory
[09:42] <janusday> ompaul, so I should just choose 2 sa my default runlevel?
[09:42] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, it should have been, :-) if you type history > ndiswrapper you can see what command you ran
[09:42] <earthen> distanceisdeath, I'm not too far removed from a noob so don't worrie about asking questions and such
[09:42] <ompaul> janusday, it should do so automagically, but yes
[09:42] <Derami1> Is there a way to resize the grid icons snap to on the desktop? I am running Gnome.
[09:43] <janusday> ompaul, ok I just wandered how to control if X is starting automaticcaly at boot...
[09:43] <distanceisdeath> okay
[09:43] <ompaul> earthen, well you keep a gang load of kids safe with dans guardian and stuff :-)
[09:43] <distanceisdeath> yeah you just saved a fourteen year olds butt
[09:43] <root1> quit
[09:43] <earthen> ompaul, yeah it's been running great I heven't tuched it a long time,
[09:44] <root1> \q
[09:44] <earthen> ompaul, Only problem is now I'm not sure i remember how to set it up in case I have to reinstall :-)
[09:45] <earthen> distanceisdeath, you should be able to brows for network now. can you do that?
[09:45] <ompaul> janusday, well it should start with x if you want to stop that behaviour I suggest you install "bum" boot up manager and tell it to turn off GDM
[09:45] <ompaul> janusday, then you can start it with /etc/init.d/gdm start
[09:45] <ompaul> janusday, many ways to skin a cat and that is one of them
[09:46] <ompaul> earthen, you remember its one line uncommented in dans and away you go then it is a matter for the rbl
[09:47] <janusday> ompaul, ok now I have installed bum.
[09:47] <distanceisdeath> earthen
[09:47] <earthen> ompaul, my latest headache is trying to setup windows 2003 Active directory  while still using Ubuntu as the primary DNS server LOL
[09:47] <distanceisdeath> im still figuring out my static ip and stuff
[09:47] <ompaul> janusday, sudo bum < start there
[09:47] <janusday> ompaul, so I just do ipdate-rc.d gdm defaults
[09:47] <firestorm> ok I got it to work sort of but I can only create directorys from terminal not nautilus
[09:47] <janusday> ompaul, ok thanks
[09:48] <emdash> ompaul: i tried ati again
[09:48] <earthen> distanceisdeath, ok I was asuming that the wifi was using DHCP
[09:48] <defcon8> i installed libapache-mod-python2.4. how do i configure this to be used by apache2?
[09:48] <ompaul> earthen, enjoy, there is a #windows channel on this network maybe they know - just refer to an external dns server :-)
[09:49] <Frogzoo> firestorm: take a look at both chmod +s & chmod +t on the directory, usually both are what you want
[09:49] <defcon8> anyone?
[09:49] <emdash> ompaul: it dies, i could send the detailed xserver output
[09:49] <aroman> hello all
[09:49] <ompaul> emdash, not to the channel
[09:49] <earthen> ompaul, there is I did not know that thanks your allways pointing me in the right direction
[09:50] <ompaul> emdash, go back to your framebuffer - in the short term and look for a ppc user :-)
[09:50] <distanceisdeath> oh
[09:50] <ompaul> any PPC user here willing to talk with emdash
[09:50] <distanceisdeath> maybe t is
[09:50] <distanceisdeath> lemme try that
[09:50] <defcon8> noone uses apache?
[09:50] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, stop with the enters - that is not an option any more okay!
[09:50] <stjepan> anyone here uses GNOME Dictionary?
[09:50] <aroman> so here's the deal. I'm out of CDs and I want to put xubuntu on my desktop computer. I can boot through PXE (I have everything set up). But, I have a netboot image only for regular ubuntu (which will install ubuntu-desktop, not, I'm guessing xubuntu-desktop). How can I pxe install in such a way as to not install any -desktop packages (just give me a base system with a command prompt only) ?
[09:51] <ompaul> defcon8, people do maybe they did not see your question
[09:51] <janusday> ompaul, but "update-rc.d gdm defaults" gives that the symbolic links already exists.
[09:51] <defcon8> i installed libapache-mod-python2.4. how do i configure this to be used by apache2?
[09:52] <chowells2> aroman: would it not be easier to just do a full install and remove the one you don't want?
[09:52] <earthen> ompaul, what do you mean by distanceisdeath and doing enters, I don't see anything unusual with his posts?
[09:52] <aroman> chowells2: why? It's gonna save me a lot of time downloading all those packages
[09:52] <ompaul> janusday, your trying to turn it off I imagine - if it is not working then your previous question mislead me - :-) so it would be sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm :-)
[09:53] <firestorm> Frog, I have those set users can creat folders but they become owners of those folder and permission are drwxr-xr-r on the created folder
[09:53] <aroman> ok I see that there's apparently a parameter called ubuntu/install-type=custom
[09:53] <aroman> anyone ever used it?
[09:53] <distanceisdeath> earthen how do i figure out the dhcp?
[09:53] <chowells2> aroman: oh, big downloads don't bother me
[09:53] <janusday> ompaul, I'll try that
[09:53] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, System Settings Networking from the menu
[09:53] <aroman> chowells2: yeah, me neither but I want it FAST NOW! :P
[09:53] <chowells2> aroman: heh
[09:54] <aroman> yeah
[09:54] <aroman> ^_^
[09:54] <distanceisdeath> not to enter then ompaul...to find what they are
[09:54] <ompaul> defcon8, I don't use it with modules - for some reason I don't need to but I can check a book or two :-)
[09:54] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, is english your first language?
[09:54] <distanceisdeath> yes
=== funkyHat is now known as funkyhat|away
[09:55] <earthen> distanceisdeath, DHCP should auto connect you with the right ip and dns numbers you don't figure it out it is just sopost to work
[09:55] <cvasilak> hi there, i just upgraded to an smp kernel for daper LTS release, the problem is that wireless doesn't work any more(for 386 stock kernel works fine), any help?
[09:55] <firestorm> MAybe I should explain exactly what I want to try to do I want to have a folder /home/share created with permissions for all users to read and write and I want all files/directorys within that directory to retain read and write for all users
[09:55] <distanceisdeath> thr right ip and dns?  where do i enter those?
[09:55] <cvasilak> i am using ipw3945 chipset
[09:55] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, you don't the machine does it automatically
[09:56] <distanceisdeath> oh okay
[09:56] <defcon8> ompaul, i will find out. thanks
[09:56] <stjepan> anyone here uses GNOME Dictionary?
[09:56] <emdash> hm
[09:56] <emdash> i remember now
[09:57] <ompaul> defcon8, there is #apache
[09:57] <pally> how could I know what's new for dapper?
[09:57] <distanceisdeath> if its activating the interface is it connecting?
[09:57] <emdash> okay, so i gave it the wrong value for video ram, (megabytes when it should have been kilobytes)...that gets xorg working with the ati driver. but then what happens is that video display is screwed up
[09:58] <Pharaoh_Atem> i think something very wrong occurred in shipit, what do i do?
[09:58] <emdash> it'sl ike the wrong modeline for the lcd or something, it's split in the middle and wraps around to the top of the screen
[09:58] <earthen> distanceisdeath, no I think it's just trying to turn on the network card
=== bigkevmcjcp is now known as gordonjcp
[09:59] <Pharaoh_Atem> it seems shipit sent Ubuntu 6.06 CDs before its release
[09:59] <earthen> distanceisdeath, If it does not activate it then ther is something wrong and maybe your card does not work with ndswrapper
[09:59] <distanceisdeath> it activates
[10:00] <distanceisdeath> it give me the option to deavtivate when its done...on the right panel
[10:00] <Pharaoh_Atem> the DAY that shipit switched to Ubuntu 6.06, i ordered a set of Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Ubuntu CDs
[10:00] <earthen> distanceisdeath, or the ndswrapper doesn't like that driver
[10:00] <Pharaoh_Atem> and it says now that yesterday they were approved and sent to shipping company
[10:00] <distanceisdeath> could WEP be the problem?
[10:00] <distanceisdeath> type in the wrong password
[10:00] <distanceisdeath> ?
[10:01] <earthen> distanceisdeath, you should turn off wep on the access point
[10:01] <Pharaoh_Atem> i guess no one here actually works on Shipit
[10:01] <distanceisdeath> one second
[10:01] <earthen> distanceisdeath, I've hear ndswapper has problems connecting when wep is turned on sometimes
[10:01] <aroman> if I do an expert install will I be able to select which packages I want installed?

[10:04] <cannibal14> i d/l ubuntu and burned an iso disk
[10:04] <NickGarvey> how is this possible?  FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition 7: enlarged logical partitions overlap ---- I thought only 4 logical partitions could exist..
[10:04] <cannibal14> i think its installed ubuntu over windoze...
[10:04] <Snake__> NickGarvey: 4 primary partions, unlimited logical iirc
[10:04] <NickGarvey> snake_: okie dokie, so next question
[10:04] <ompaul> cannibal14, go find your father and say the word "sorry"
[10:04] <cannibal14> oh shit
[10:04] <NickGarvey> what does that mean?
[10:05] <firestorm> Snake, I had to run the java install from synaptic for the license to present itself then it worked fine
[10:05] <ompaul> cannibal14, do not use bad language in this channel thanks
[10:05] <NickGarvey> cannibal14: ..thats not good
[10:05] <pike__> cannibal14: no dont.  dont say anything if he asks just tell him "it must be a virus"
[10:05] <Snake__> firestorm: Ill try that with adept, and pray it will work
[10:05] <cannibal14> sorry
[10:05] <Snake__> NickGarvey: No idea :) I just know my hardware hehe
[10:06] <cannibal14> even when i shut it down, it starts as ubuntu...
[10:06] <NickGarvey> snake_: ;)  yeah, I have 7 partitions because I have 3 OS's
[10:06] <NickGarvey> and swap and fat32 and a /boot partition

[10:06] <Snake__> NickGarvey: perhaps boot up in a live disk and check it out with gparted?
[10:06] <ompaul> cannibal14, no point in that he should use linux anyway
[10:06] <Snake__> best I can think
[10:06] <ompaul> :-)
[10:06] <prxq> (that's on dapper RC1)
[10:07] <Snake__> firestorm: no good
[10:07] <prxq> any ideas?
[10:07] <ompaul> he gone
[10:07] <NickGarvey> ah one is the extended
[10:07] <The> does ayone know how to make a plugin ???
[10:07] <The> a plugin for Azureus
[10:08] <Snake__> NickGarvey: yes there has to be one extended, then your logical are seated under that
[10:08] <firestorm> Snake go to system, admin then synaptic package manager and use it
[10:08] <EmxBA> hi everyone again
[10:08] <EmxBA> i have a very strange problem with apt
[10:08] <NickGarvey> Snake__: yup :), now I need to find whats overlapping what..
[10:08] <ompaul> The, your nick is going to annoy you as every time someone says the it will light up the screen, - go to #azureus for that
[10:08] <emdash> okay well, despite the fact that the display is initially garbled, i'm able to login
[10:08] <emdash> and it seems to get the correct resolution after that happens
[10:08] <ompaul> the problem with that is that the is a common word :-)
[10:08] <Snake__> firestorm: one moment, as I said im on kubuntu, synaptic is a gnome program :)
[10:09] <firestorm> o nm then
[10:09] <EmxBA> anyone? i tried to install some .deb packaged from debian dvd but they have unmet dependencies
[10:09] <Snake__> firestorm: dont worry, ill dl it and try, synaptic may do something adept doesnt
[10:09] <EmxBA> so now when i want to apt-get install *something* i must download 40MB :( but i have only dialup connection
[10:09] <Blissex> EmxBA: add the DVD as an APT source with 'apt-cdrom' and use 'apt' to install them.
[10:09] <firestorm> Snake, yeah I got the same error till I used synaptic
[10:09] <emdash> could it be that it tries to start gdm at the highest resolution ?
[10:10] <emdash> at least the colors aren't reversed now
[10:10] <EmxBA> Blissex: but it takes too long to scan dvd

[10:17] <Subhuman> pez , you need to mount it
[10:18] <pez> i think it is already mounted as it shows up when i do 'ls /'
[10:18] <distanceisdeath> So how do i switch over to kde?
[10:19] <thenetduck> #azureus
[10:20] <saxin> distanceisdeath, try: sudo apt-get install kde

[10:21] <jonah> y guys i changed my password with sudo passwd, so now things ask me for a password but they didn't use to. how do i go back to how it used to be?
[10:21] <pez> how can i mount it?
[10:21] <pike__> pez: easiest thing to do might be to 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' find the line for your graphics card saying driver    "nvidia"  and change that to "vesa".  after that at least you will have a gui and you can work on installing nvidia drivers
[10:22] <Subhuman> pez, if your cdrom drive is on your othr ide cable
[10:22] <prxq> here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=85064 it says something about doing "apt-get install linux-tree" which fails on my shiny new dapper box. What is the correct name?
[10:22] <Subhuman> it'll be line
[10:23] <Subhuman> "sudo mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom" or "sudo mount /dev/hdd /media/cdrom

[10:24] <Beawolfe> I looked at "Amanda" but couldnt figure out what platform to use
[10:24] <pike__> distanceisdeath: eh?
[10:24] <distanceisdeath> the same directory...so it knows where the installation file is
[10:25] <pez> pike__: i tried that command and it says my driver is 'nv'? will it work if i replace it with  'nvidia'?
[10:25] <salah> hi. is there simply anything in ubuntu which don't let outgoing connections work? ssh(fs), ftp, web server etc works fine, but ping, apt or anything else which uses outgoing connection don't work. any ideas why not?
[10:25] <pike__> distanceisdeath: it will download it from an online repo and install appropriately you can type that from any location
[10:25] <prxq> so how's the in what package is the dapper kernel tree?
[10:26] <crimsun> linux-source-2.6.15
[10:26] <pike__> pez: not yet if you change it to vesa you will at leat have your desktop back
[10:26] <distanceisdeath> oh okay
[10:26] <pike__> pez: are you on dapper or breey
[10:26] <distanceisdeath> just makin sure...im a noob
[10:26] <pike__> distanceisdeath: its alot to take in
[10:26] <distanceisdeath> yeah
[10:27] <distanceisdeath> would i download the breezy?
[10:27] <pez> pike: im on breezy
[10:27] <prxq> crimsun: any ideas why compilation fails?
[10:27] <pez> ive just changed it from 'nv' to 'vesa'.. but how do i save it? LOL
[10:27] <pike__> pez: any reason you wanted the drivers from nvidia site? theyre easy enough to install but it is some work
[10:28] <pike__> pez: ctl-o i thinkg dont use nano often
[10:28] <crimsun> prxq: compilation of what?
[10:28] <prxq> crimsun: compilation of the 2.6.15 kernel so installed.
[10:29] <pez> yeah it saved ;-) good memory pike!
[10:29] <distanceisdeath> if i install kde will i lose my drivers and network settings?
[10:29] <mimi_working> I was watching a V.C.D on mplayer and it froze, can not close it, but the "force quit" dialog box is not coming up, how can I close it, via the GUi or the term?
[10:29] <pez> pike: i will go for the 'vesa' option and install the nvidia driver once i have a GUI
[10:30] <linchris> hello, its me again :) I wonder which software to use to erase DVD-RWs?
[10:30] <prxq> maybe I have to specify the compiler? like CC=gcc-4.0 or something like that?
[10:30] <ompaul> distanceisdeath, no just do this and let it happen >>sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop<< then spend some time getting familar with it
[10:30] <mimi_working> be right back, if anyone thinks of something, please /notice me

Only solution was RESTART. *Please, don't ignore this, try to solve my problem. I will explain it in details if needed. Anyway, thanks :D :D :D

[10:49] <gilprice> On my way there, thanks...

[10:51] <jimminy> Hi, I'm worried that after an install of Dapper, there is not enough information available to the user (ie onlie help) to get an Internet connection up. I would think this is rather important as getting connected to the net would be one of the first things a user does, in order to get support and install software... Is there anything I can do to try to get this information into Dapper beffore relese ? At least could anyone point me to a mail
[10:51] <jimminy> ing list/forum where I could bring this point up (sorry I'm not otherwise familiar with Ubuntu, I use Gentoo but install ubunt for my friends) ? Thanks !

[10:52] <NickGarvey> jimminy: use a live cd to get things working once and write down what you do
[10:53] <jimminy> gnomefreak : thanks, I'll go there, I'm not using dapper, but i'm wanting to add information to it...
[10:53] <Techno_2> Umm, can someone briefly go over what recompiling the kernel is about. All I want to do is add in a patch, but it's proving to be very confusing :S
[10:54] <mwe> Techno_2: it's pretty hard the first time
[10:54] <EmxBA> gnomefreak: it still gasn't done
[10:54] <EmxBA> *hasn't
[10:54] <mwe> Techno_2: I suggest you read a howto
[10:55] <Techno_2> I've done it in mandrake before, but I can't seem to get the make command working and being a newb don't really have a clue how the kernal interacts with the system (Or whether it is nessasary to know)
[10:55] <jimminy> NickGarvey : Yes, they're very useful for that. I'm not sure if I was very clear though, I want to contribute to dapper so that it contains documentation for getting users connected to Internet
[10:55] <mwe> Techno_2: you have to get the kernel source code, patch it. then configure and build it, put the image in place and point menu.lst to it
[10:55] <Atech> Guys I get no sound when I try to run applications
[10:55] <NickGarvey> jimminy: oh!  I'm sorry!  I'd check the wiki pages before you  write something up and find someone beat you too it ;)
[10:55] <Atech> how can I fix this
[10:56] <Techno_2> mwe: Ok thanks, that seems logical enough
[10:56] <dauoalagio> how would i install a sound driver?
[10:56] <mwe> Techno_2: it's not for the faint of heart
[10:57] <Atech> Why doesn't sound work in other applications?
[10:57] <harold> Your sound device is in use by something else.
[10:57] <Atech> ok
[10:57] <EmxBA> Blissex: now i have added Debian DVD. But i  type apt-get install -f and it againg needs to download ~40 MB, but I'm pretty sure that all those packages are on Debian DVD...what to do???
[10:57] <Atech> how can I make it so that it can be multiused?
[10:57] <Techno_2> mwe: I like a challange (And don't mind having to reisntall linux if I break it)
[10:58] <Blissex> EmxBA: evidently there are newer versions of packages online than on the DVD...
[10:58] <mwe> Techno_2: you wont have to reinstall. you can always boot the old kernel
[10:58] <harold> What apps are you using? You can't use different types like alsa and esd at the same time, as far as I know.
[10:58] <NickGarvey> !native
[10:58] <ubotu> NickGarvey: Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[10:58] <Atech> harold I have no clue. It's just the programs like ET and stuff don't play sound
[10:58] <Blissex> EmxBA: what you can do is to comment out the network-based repositories in '/etc/apt/sources.list'
[10:59] <EmxBA> Blissex: OK, i'll try that
[10:59] <Atech> but XMMS plays sound
[10:59] <Blissex> EmxBA: note that I am still assuming that you know exactly what you are doing and the likely consequences...
[10:59] <jimminy> NickGarvey : I've been hacking on the wiki for 2 days, there was not very much info, especialy on ADSL USB modems ; there is still a lot missing, i've only managed to scrape one adsl USB modem for testing so far... but am hoping to have a few in the next days, to test the howtos. I think this information would be very useful on the CD though, as it seemed a little daft to provide a web link for the info in connectiong to the net...
[10:59] <EmxBA> Blissex: don't worry
[11:00] <NickGarvey> jimminy: ;) yeah I agree
[11:00] <Techno_2> Is it me or are the repositorys down?
[11:00] <NickGarvey> Techno_2: lemme check, I updated like 5 min ago I think
[11:00] <mwe> Techno_2: works here
[11:00] <mcphail> Techno_2: dapper repos seem ok
[11:00] <NickGarvey> Techno_2: breezy is good
[11:00] <mwe> Techno_2: using archive.ubuntu.com ?
[11:01] <magical_trevsky> hi, does anyone know how to change the owner's name on ubuntu (that you put in during installation) from the command line.. is it just stored in a file somewhere?
[11:01] <Techno_2> http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
[11:01] <Atech> harold: what can fix this?
[11:01] <Techno_2> I believe so mwe
[11:01] <mwe> Techno_2: I'd remove the gb. part
[11:01] <NickGarvey> magical_trevsky: owners name?
[11:01] <Techno_2> ok dokey
[11:01] <mwe> Techno_2: that makes sure you get to a good mirror
[11:02] <magical_trevsky> NickGarvey, the bit  where you put in your full name before choosing the username
[11:02] <harold> Atech: you need to set your other applications to use the same sound device, so if XMMS is using ALSA, set others to use ALSA.
[11:02] <mcphail> This Xgl thing is rather a laugh, isn't it?
[11:02] <nimrod> hello, i just started using kubuntu, anyway to make the input local show on taskbar like gnome does?
[11:03] <Techno_2> I'm guessing "gb" means great britian. Why is it that UK FTP servers always seem to nto work compared ot european ones :S
[11:03] <Techno_2> Or is that just me?
[11:03] <ZhayTee> Moses_, be quiet.
[11:03] <Moses_> Kubuntu anyway to.
[11:03] <mwe> Techno_2: for your kernel compilation step one is getting the kernel source. you can start with the ubuntu kernel sources or the vanilla kernel from kernel.org. I got it from kernel.org
[11:03] <jimminy> NickGarvey : do ypu know which forum / mailing list etc. I could bring this point up on please ?
[11:03] <mwe> Techno_2: us. is also broken from time to time
[11:03] <Atech> harold: now how would you do that? in the terminal?
[11:04] <mwe> Techno_2: just using archive.ubuntu.com seems to be a good solution
[11:04] <NickGarvey> jimminy: I am definitely not the person to ask, sorry about that
[11:04] <Techno_2> mwe: Well there's a nice kernel source option in synaptic package manager, I thought I'd go for that
[11:04] <Techno_2> But I am temtped by the vanilla one
[11:05] <harold> Atech: The option is usually in the preferences area of most of your apps.
[11:05] <mwe> Techno_2: there is no guarantee that your patch will apply on top of the ubuntu patches but you can try
[11:05] <mwe> Techno_2: what patch is it?
[11:05] <Techno_2> Suspend 2, to enable hibernatign abilities
[11:05] <Techno_2> hibernating*
[11:06] <mwe> Techno_2: I don't think that will apply to anything but vanilla
[11:06] <harold> Atech: alternatively, you can force the application to use a sound device by running it from command line. I'm not quite sure how that works, though.
[11:06] <mwe> Techno_2: it pathes a lot of files. I'm using it myself
[11:06] <Techno_2> I ran the script, and it told me I had to now recompile my kernel
[11:06] <mwe> Techno_2: yes, you do
[11:07] <deadcake> excuse me, i want to reinstall windows on a my free partition but i will lost the bootloader what can i do to preserve the bootloader after the windows installation?
[11:07] <Techno_2> Ah, so may I skip the source bit :P
[11:07] <mwe> Techno_2: no
[11:07] <mwe> Techno_2: :|
[11:07] <Techno_2> hehe
[11:07] <mwe> Techno_2: I'm using a custom kernel as well
[11:07] <Techno_2> Vanilla it is!
[11:08] <perpetualrabbit> does anyone here have tried debootstrap with dapper?
[11:08] <mwe> Techno_2: configuring it is the hard part

[11:08] <harold> deadcake: I have a link that could help you. It's in my bookmarks, so give me a second to find it.

[11:10] <perpetualrabbit> It could be in a chroot on whatever else linux installation, in my case breezy, but could be gentoo or redhat.
[11:10] <crimsun> perpetualrabbit: sure it matters, because the debootstrap packages differ between !dapper and dapper.
[11:11] <mwe> Techno_2: well go to kernel.org and download the full sources of 2.6.16.18 or whatever the latest patch level is
[11:11] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, oh, I wasn't aware of that.
[11:12] <perpetualrabbit> I downloaded the debootstrap 0.3.0.3 or 3.0.3 or something like that. What is !dapper? dapper beta I suppose?

[11:15] <perpetualrabbit> My current problem is, I run debootstrap, and I get a base system that is not configured, and I have no idea what to configure by hand. For instance shadow file is missing, but that may be just one thing out of a hundred?
[11:15] <mwe> Techno_2: I'd start out with the config from the current ubuntu kernel and copy it to .config and do a make oldconfig
[11:15] <mwe> Techno_2: that should be a solid base for a make menuconfig
[11:15] <rredd4> installing breezy, the installer says that the mount point is   /media/hda5   is this correct?
[11:16] <rredd4> thought is should be root
[11:16] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, so there is no specific error message, it's just that the complete configuration that base-config used to do, has now to be done by hand...
[11:16] <mwe> rredd4: it depends on your partitioning
[11:16] <rredd4> mwe I had debian on here, its mount point was root

[11:18] <ubotu> from memory, resolution is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[11:18] <mwe> Techno_2: you should dl the kernel sources and extract it to /usr/src

[11:20] <zero_analog> *step 6 is where it prompts for mount points and formatting, I can't see the next buttons at all -- Is this a known bug, have other people found ways around it?
[11:20] <Techno_2> mwe: I am tempted to login as root

[11:27] <ompaul> Some_Person, you don't want do to that, so I will say to you don't do that and there ya go
[11:27] <mwe> Techno_2: how did you try extracting it?
[11:27] <NoUse> Some_Person its a horrible idea, not safe, insecure
[11:27] <Techno_2> I tried to drag some fiels from an archiver program :P
[11:27] <mwe> Techno_2: hey use the terminal
[11:27] <Some_Person> I want to do that because I can only write to hda3 as root (can you fix that?)
[11:27] <ompaul> Some_Person, now your getting sense
[11:27] <Some_Person> hda3 is fat32
[11:28] <Techno_2> Looks like the terminal si my new best friend
[11:28] <ompaul> !fat32
[11:28] <ubotu> Download and run http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/diskmounter to make your windows or mac partitions mount automatically.  If you wish to set it up yourself by hand, read: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions
[11:28] <ompaul> Some_Person, ^^^
[11:28] <mwe> Techno_2: open a terminal and type sudo -i. then cd /usr/src. then tar jxvf /path/to/linux-2.6.16.x.tar.bz2
[11:28] <Some_Person> it mounts automaticly already
[11:28] <Some_Person> problem is, i can only write to it as root
[11:28] <EmxBA> Blissex: just a tip: when you uncomment previously commented network repositories you must run apt-get update again
[11:28] <ompaul> Some_Person, just a moment I am not a windows user
[11:28] <mwe> Techno_2: the tab key will help you complete path and file names
[11:29] <ompaul> Some_Person, but I will have an answer for you
[11:29] <void^> Some_Person: read that link, or add either a "user" or "umask" option manually (see man mount)
[11:29] <sas171> hi, can you help me, I just accedently removed my /etc/udev/rules/60-symlinks.rules on dapper. What was in it? Can postebin your copy?

[11:30] <NoUse> Some_Person man mount is the documentation for the mount program
[11:31] <Some_Person> I want to use hda3 as a transfer partition between ubuntu and windows
[11:31] <sas171> mwe: how can I reinstall udev?

[11:31] <moo-min> how's minimal ubuntu install for detecting onboard ethrnet hardware
[11:31] <sas171> oh, thx
[11:31] <Techno_2> mwe: It's a gz type, not a bz w/e
[11:31] <Tidus> Some_Person: you're gonna have to format it FAT32 if you wanna do that.
[11:31] <mwe> Techno_2: oh. then tar zxvf instead of jxvf
[11:31] <Some_Person> it already is fat32
[11:31] <Techno_2> Ah found it
[11:31] <Techno_2> oh nm :P
[11:31] <NoUse> Some_Person run this: "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"
[11:31] <mwe> Techno_2: what is the file name and how big is it?
[11:31] <EmxBA> Blissex?
[11:31] <NoUse> Some_Person tell me when it opens
[11:31] <Some_Person> in windows, it is drive F, in ubuntu, it is drive hda3

[11:32] <mwe> Techno_2: good
[11:32] <Techno_2> Weee
[11:32] <cvasilak> hi there, what is the name of the package for the nvidia-kernel SMP version
[11:32] <mwe> Techno_2: sudo -i then cd /usr/src
[11:32] <Techno_2> Yeap
[11:32] <Techno_2> Already there
[11:32] <Techno_2> Extracted
[11:32] <mwe> Techno_2: then tar zxvf /path/to/linux-2.6.16.8.tar.gz
[11:33] <Techno_2> Done :D
[11:33] <ompaul> Some_Person, you need this in your /etc/fstab for that line >>>  vfat umask=000
[11:33] <mwe> Techno_2: good

[11:33] <sas171> mwe: ok i did it, if I reboot now, will Im able to boot in GNOME again?
[11:33] <mwe> Techno_2: now ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.16.18 /usr/src/linux
[11:33] <Techno_2> Yeap, it's there looking pretty
[11:34] <mwe> Techno_2: then chown -R root:root /usr/src/linux-2.6.16.18
[11:34] <Techno_2> What do these two commands do
[11:34] <mwe> sas171: make sure the file got restored
[11:34] <mwe> Techno_2: make a symlink and change owner to root
[11:34] <ompaul> Techno_2, please do not press enter after one or two words get your whole thought onto the one line
[11:35] <mwe> Techno_2: by default owner is somthing weird
[11:35] <eshowl> can anyone help me with OpenGL problem?
[11:35] <sas171> mwe: shit, it isnt
[11:35] <mwe> Techno_2: and /usr/src/linux should always point to the current kernel source tree
[11:35] <mwe> sas171: odd
[11:36] <Techno_2> ompaul: Sorry
[11:36] <mwe> shouldn't apt-get install --reinstall foobar reinstall foobar and all of it's files?
[11:36] <ompaul> Techno_2, now ya know ;-)
[11:37] <Seveas> mwe, no
[11:37] <mwe> Seveas: oh

[11:37] <mwe> Seveas: how then?
[11:37] <Techno_2> mwe: Ah it creates a shortcut I see. I think I'll look up the chown command
[11:37] <mcphail> Don't you ned to --purge?
[11:37] <damage1> Hi all
[11:37] <mwe> Seveas: somone deleted an important config file
[11:37] <ompaul> mwe you must use the purge, feel the --purge
[11:37] <Seveas> if you want to renew configuration: dpkg -P --force-depends $package followed bu apt-get install
[11:37] <EmxBA> damage1: hi!
[11:37] <damage1> hi dude
[11:38] <nitrorxn> hi, I am new to Ubuntu and after installing it won't boot up. I'm using LILO and I select my partition and it starts booting (sees CPU, USB, DVD, etc) but then I get the following errors:

[11:39] <mwe> sas171: well give your email and I'll send it to you
=== HellDragon is now known as HellDragon`
[11:39] <Hexidigital_> are Vino and SSH able to be run simultaneously?
[11:39] <sas171> mwe: i queried it to you allready
[11:39] <mwe> Techno_2: yeah. next you should copy /boot/config-whateveryourcurrentkernelis /usr/src/linux/.config
[11:39] <Hexidigital_> (i'm getting a connection refused error with one or the other, depending on what i'm logged in as)
[11:40] <mcphail> mwe: can't you just pull the conf file from the .deb archive?
[11:40] <mwe> sas171: I didnt get it
[11:40] <mwe> sas171: are you registered?
[11:40] <Juhaz> Hexidigital_, sure they are.
=== HellDragon-- is now known as HellDragon
[11:40] <Hexidigital_> Juhaz:: thanks... i must be doing something wrong
[11:40] <mwe> mcphail: good idea
[11:40] <Mysta_> hello, how do I perform stress test on my newly configured ubuntu server? i want to make sure it is stable, is this possible?
[11:41] <Seveas> mwe, dpkg-deb -x ;)
[11:41] <Hexidigital_> Juhaz:: when i had vino running on my server (which i just logged out of), i wasn't able to ssh into it
[11:41] <Seveas> mwe, dpkg-reconfigure may help too
[11:42] <mwe> yes
[11:43] <Techno_2> mwe: The .config directory doesn't exist, should it be there or am I expected to create it
[11:43] <racestoapril1> is it true that in newer versions of ubuntu ipod mounting and syncing is as easy as plug and play?
[11:43] <mwe> Techno_2: it should be a file and not exist already
[11:43] <mwe> Techno_2: don't you have /boot/config-something?
[11:44] <Techno_2> Yes, I have that part :)
[11:44] <mwe> Techno_2: good. cp /boot/config-something /usr/src/linux/.config
[11:44] <mwe> Techno_2: it will copy the file to that name
[11:44] <Techno_2> Oh sorry
[11:44] <EmxBA> !bootsplash
[11:44] <ubotu> EmxBA: Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[11:44] <kspath> Mysta_: sudo apt-cache search stress test    also search for bonnie and sysstat
[11:44] <Techno_2> I thought you meant copy it into a directory called .config
[11:45] <mwe> Techno_2: that is /boot/config-something being the same as /usr/src/linux/.config

[11:48] <mwe> sas171: I'll put it to pastebin
[11:48] <NoUse> eshowl xorg is the system that Linux uses to display graphics, Desktops like gnome and KDE connect to it to display their windows etc

[11:49] <bit_doidao> EmxBA, Hummm, for desktop, i don know. Maybe for servers, debian rocks.

[11:57] <rab> can i install things through ssh
[11:57] <blaze> Hexidigital_, no
[11:57] <Jowi> rab: what kind of server? very good apache and ftp server setup wikis are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com
[11:57] <mrDaniel> ok, i will try the uninstaller. and what i have to do than?
[11:57] <SopWATh> rab: yes, you have to install the openssh-server first
[11:57] <Hexidigital_> blaze:: that will install your headers
[11:57] <eshowl> <NoUse> OK, i had been searching it for days @@
[11:57] <Techno_2> mwe: Yay, I managed to work otu hwo to use a command line heh
[11:57] <mwe> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) should work literally
[11:57] <Mysta_> is it possible to start multiple X sessions remotely? lets say i want 4 users to connect to a ubuntu box, how is that done?
[11:57] <blaze> and what do you mean by "output"
[11:57] <NoUse> mrDaniel re-run the installer from the wiki and it should work
[11:58] <blaze> i've pasted what error i get
[11:58] <rab> jowi, i just installed ubuntu as a base server on my box, now i want to intall apache php and mysql. I want to know if i can do it through ssh
[11:58] <blaze> what should i replace {uname -r} with?
[11:58] <mrDaniel> 'installer from the wiki', which wiki you mean?

[11:58] <Abo> Seveas, I did this first thing ;) I was searching to see how to configure it, I found this it seems helpfull http://wiki.debian.org/?SubversionApache2SSLHowto
[11:58] <SopWATh> rab: you can install almost anything via apt-get
[11:58] <blaze> Hexidigital_,
[11:58] <mwe> Techno_2: well it can be very powerful
[11:58] <blaze> ?
[11:58] <Jowi> rab: you can absolutely do it through ssh. no probs. i administer several machines that way.
[11:58] <SopWATh> I just installed a dapperdrake LAMP system, do I need to do the "./bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql" thing as listed here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP?highlight=%28mysql%29
[11:58] <eshowl> NoUse, it's ok, thanks for your help!!
[11:58] <Techno_2> Woo I patched it :D

[11:59] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, could you reproduce my "problem" (it's more an side effect of a change, not a bug)
[11:59] <Jowi> rab: if you set up the server that way. i use sudo all the way
[11:59] <rab> ah
[11:59] <rab> k
[11:59] <Techno_2> IT did ;)
[11:59] <crimsun> perpetualrabbit: as in the "missing" /etc/shadow?

[11:59] <Hexidigital_> blaze:: in your error, it said your headers were not installed
[12:00] <Techno_2> I did :)
[12:00] <mwe> Techno_2: now cd /usr/src/linux if you're not there and do a "make oldconfig" and tell me if you get errors
[12:00] <blaze> ok Hexidigital_ so.. i should install all QT3 headers, right?
=== t_z_ is now known as t_z
[12:00] <mwe> Techno_2: if you're not missing build-essential it should work
[12:00] <Hexidigital_> blaze:: yes
[12:00] <Hexidigital_> blaze:: no
[12:01] <Hexidigital_> blaze:: just the one you need
[12:01] <Techno_2> mwe: Yes, it appears I need ot isntall the gcc compiler
[12:01] <Hexidigital_> uname -r in terminal, and look for that
[12:01] <mwe> Techno_2: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[12:01] <mwe> Techno_2: it will get some other stuff as well
[12:01] <Techno_2> Ah cool
=== dreamthief|away is now known as dreamthief
[12:02] <blaze> i see :) 10x
[12:02] <dusty> Hey guys I have a wheel mouse and im wondering what I have to put under the mouse section of xorg.conf to make it work? Everything else works fine, apart from this?
[12:02] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, yes, exactly. It is missing, because normally at that point you'd run base-config. But it has been replaced by pkgsel, I just heard, and I'm unsure what needs to be started to get a dialog, that then configures things like shadow passwords, timezones, library paths etc.
[12:02] <Abo> how can I find which process is binding the port 80 (I need to run appache server)
[12:03] <crimsun> perpetualrabbit: tzconfig, locale-gen, and so on
[12:03] <mwe> Abo: sudo netstat -ntlp
[12:03] <perpetualrabbit> abo, with netstat.
[12:03] <concept10> anyone know if there is a deb for VIM 7 or GVIM?
[12:03] <Hexidigital_> Abo:: there shouldn't be anything bound to 80... you can scan your server with network tools (in administration) to see if it is open
[12:03] <Hexidigital_> i retract my previous statement
[12:03] <mwe> concept10: I don't think there are any official ones at least
[12:04] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, yes, but there seems to be no comprehensive installation guide a la gentoo, if you go the debootstrap way.
[12:04] <shannon> !dma
[12:04] <Techno_2> mwe: Do I want to automatically append version informatio nto the version string?
[12:04] <Abo> mwe, perpetualrabbit, Hexidigital, with netstat I can see there is something in the State:Listen on the port 80, but how can I tell which process is it?
[12:04] <mwe> Techno_2: no
[12:04] <Hexidigital_> Abo:: do you have apache 1.3 installed?
[12:04] <perpetualrabbit> crimsun, if I follow the normal installer, it's easy enough, but I want to install within a chroot, on a server, to prepare images for workstations
[12:05] <mwe> Techno_2: just accept the default with enter for now. you'll do a make menuconfig afterwards
[12:05] <kspath> Abo: netstat , fuser, lsof
[12:05] <dusty> Anyone?
[12:05] <Abo> I just did apt-get install apache2, would that run the server as well?
[12:05] <perpetualrabbit> Abo, yes
[12:05] <Techno_2> mwe: I can see why
[12:05] <Hexidigital_> Abo:: type 127.0.0.1 in your web browser, see if something comes up
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
[12:06] <Abo> oh ... ps -auxww | grep apache shows it's running ... thank you (sorry of that)
[12:06] <Techno_2> Oh dear, menu config failed :S
[12:06] <Hexidigital_> Abo:: enjoy :)
[12:06] <james_xxx> can anyone recommend a g-band USB wireless adapter that works well with ubuntu/kubuntu. i have a linksys wusb54gs, but cannot get it to work.
[12:06] <mwe> Techno_2: you probably need libncurses5-dev
[12:07] <Techno_2> Can I apt get it?
[12:07] <mwe> Techno_2: yes
[12:07] <mwe> Techno_2: sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
[12:07] <dauoalagio> can anyone explain to me on how to install flash player?
[12:07] <EmxBA> hey guys
[12:08] <EmxBA> i gotta go
[12:08] <Techno_2> Bye EmxBA :)
[12:08] <EmxBA> goodbye
[12:08] <MetaMorfoziS> okay, good night everybody. kshutdown @ 20min.)
[12:08] <dauoalagio> earthen are you there?
[12:09] <Techno_2> mwe: Yay, I've got the menu up. Am I right in thinking that I now go through all of these and select my hardware?
[12:09] <issaker> sup all
[12:09] <issaker> i just installed ubuntu and now my xp wont boot
[12:09] <issaker> can someone help me with this?
[12:09] <dauoalagio> that sucks
[12:09] <dauoalagio> im a noob too
[12:09] <mwe> Techno_2: go to power management and enable suspend2
[12:09] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: did you have dynamic discs on xp?
[12:09] <issaker> dymanic discs?
[12:10] <mwe> Techno_2: set default resume partition to that of your swap partition
[12:10] <issaker> hexidigital, what are those?
[12:10] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: it's a way of allocating the discs in XP... that would stop Ubuntu from finding the boot record, but if you didnt know what it was, you probably didn't have it enabled
[12:11] <issaker> lemme describe my situation a little bit
[12:11] <Hexidigital_> ok
[12:11] <zanrek> irc.auran.com
[12:12] <Abo> anyone knows about a tool similar to "Google Desktop" for ubuntu?
[12:12] <issaker> i just installed ubuntu on a seperate partition, on the same HD as my xp installation, but seperate partition
[12:12] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: did you resize the partition?
[12:12] <issaker> both xp and ubuntu's partition are primary, with ubuntu's swapspace as a logical
[12:12] <crazy_penguin> good night, pleasent dreams!
[12:12] <shannon> where might I find more documentation on what 'iwlist power' is?
[12:13] <mwe> shannon: man iwlist
[12:13] <mwe> shannon: type that in a terminal
[12:13] <issaker> i split my HD into 2 partitions when i install xp pro, so 100 gig is for xp pro, and 100 gig is unallocated
[12:13] <Techno_2> mwe: Done. I put /dev/hdc6 (My swap parition)
[12:13] <shannon> mwe: I looked, it says very little about it
[12:13] <Hexidigital_> shannon:: in terminal, man iwlist power
[12:13] <Mortal`> How do I manually sync the clock?
[12:13] <H080J03> where is finbar1 ?
[12:13] <mwe> Techno_2: good. now it's time to compile the kernel.
[12:13] <issaker> then in the 100 unallocated gig, i furthur allocated 20 gig for ubunto, as primary, and another 20 as ubuntu's swap space
[12:13] <Techno_2> mwe: That was easy
[12:14] <shannon> Hexidigital_: anything else?
[12:14] <Mysta_> shannon: try info iwlist
[12:14] <mwe> Techno_2: then you'll boot it and see if everything works. if not you'll have to finetune things in menuconfig
[12:14] <firestorm> If I set a folder to chmod 4777 isnt any directory in the folder creater by a user suppose to assume the permission/ownership of the main folder or am I reading the man page wrong
[12:14] <issaker> installed grub
[12:14] <Hexidigital_> shannon:: sorry, that's all i know when looking for docs, besides google
[12:14] <shannon> Mysta_: okay -- I'll look into it
[12:14] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: grub installed to MBR?
[12:14] <issaker> yah
[12:14] <Techno_2> How do you compiel the kernel?
[12:14] <mwe> Techno_2: yes. you'll probably want to finetune menuconfig later if it works anyway and get rid of all the crap you don't need
[12:14] <issaker> i can choose between ubuntu and xp
[12:15] <mwe> Techno_2: exit and save the config
[12:15] <Techno_2> Yeap :)
[12:15] <issaker> when i select xp, it runs, i see the logo and the loading bar, but it will auto-restart
[12:15] <glick> whoooot dapper rc1 looks hawt!
[12:15] <issaker> same goes for safe mode
[12:15] <Techno_2> That's weird :S
[12:15] <mwe> Techno_2: then sudo make && sudo make menuconfig. while it's compiling read the suspend2 docs on what you need to add to menu.lst
[12:15] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: not sure if you'd really need a 20GB swap partition, but try this
[12:15] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell issaker about dualboot
[12:15] <shannon> info says the same thing -- perhaps I will just ask here -- is there any danger of a crash or something if I enable it?
[12:15] <Mysta_> i cant wait to get my laptop to install dapper
[12:15] <Techno_2> resume2=/dev/blahhh
[12:16] <glick> im running kubuntu breezy right now gawd i cant stand it
[12:16] <mwe> Techno_2: what about it?
[12:16] <glick> ubuntu ownz kubuntu
[12:16] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: did you get that pm from ubotu ?
[12:16] <issaker> yup
[12:16] <Techno_2> That's what you have to add I believe
[12:16] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: that sounds like a windows error to me, now
[12:16] <firestorm> the new graphics in dapper are sleek glick
[12:16] <glick> firestorm: yeah i saw
[12:16] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: if you CAN boot into windows, but it auto restarts, F8 into safe mode
[12:16] <issaker> so where would i go to fix it?
[12:16] <glick> im downloading the iso right now
[12:16] <mwe> Techno_2: yes. but blahhh should be more specific :)
[12:16] <Mysta_> issaker: you don't get a single error message?
[12:17] <mwe> Techno_2: not just the device
[12:17] <issaker> nope
[12:17] <issaker> safemode auto restarts too
[12:17] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: windows is set (by default) to restart on fatal errors
[12:17] <mwe> Techno_2: you need to create a file and stuff. the readme says what you need
[12:17] <Techno_2> mwe: Ah ok :)  Best to check the docs
[12:17] <issaker> oh..darn...
[12:17] <mwe> Techno_2: but I think you need to boot the suspend2 enabled kernel first
[12:17] <glick> firestorm: are you running RC 1?
[12:17] <mwe> Techno_2: before it will work or it will complain
[12:18] <firestorm> glick, on a machine in the other room vnc into it right now
[12:18] <mwe> Techno_2: are you doing the sudo make && sudo make modules_install ?
[12:18] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: if that's the case, and you need to reinstall windows, you should install that first, then install ubuntu again... (make sure you install XP SP2 before installing ubuntu, as it will do bad things, in my experience)
[12:18] <glick> oh you running the server edition?
[12:18] <mwe> Techno_2: or without sudo if you're root already
[12:18] <issaker> is it possible just fix MBR and be done with it?
[12:18] <glick> i dont see how vista or XP can compete with ubuntu
[12:19] <rab> hey, what file holds the computers static/DHCP ip's and gateways
[12:19] <jvai> lol
[12:19] <Mysta_> this server edition stuff is confusing me ??
[12:19] <firestorm> nah theres a remote desktop built in not sure if its new or not
[12:19] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: that will only update the MBR, not fix your booting problem
[12:19] <issaker> i see
[12:19] <Mortal`> How do I manually synchronize the time using NNTP?
[12:19] <Techno_2> mwe: Ah darn, I forgot to enabel some options, I'll have to redo menuconfig
[12:19] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: what's the problem?
[12:19] <kbrooks> glick: *linux in general*: Windows OVERWRITES the MBR and puts ITS OWN bootloader on it
[12:19] <glick> i think they should box ubuntu and sell it in stores for $299
[12:19] <issaker> why would installation on a seperate partition affect xp anyways? i dont understand
[12:19] <glick> then people would buy it
[12:19] <kbrooks> glick: no, they shouldnt
[12:19] <tOMky> I need to disable usb2.0 functionality, how can I do it?
[12:19] <firestorm> If I set a folder to chmod 4777 isnt any directory in the folder creater by a user suppose to assume the permission/ownership of the main folder or am I reading the man page wrong
[12:19] <kbrooks> glick: lower price
[12:19] <glick> kbrooks: yeah they should, it should still be freely available online
[12:20] <kbrooks> $100 is fine
[12:20] <mwe> Techno_2: what options?
[12:20] <Mysta_> Hexidigital_: im looking for details (documents) on whats installed vs. a standard install
[12:20] <Hexidigital_> glick:: perhaps you should go to the windows channel, if you are in to SELLING software
[12:20] <gnomefreak> glick: that would defeat the purpose of ubuntu
[12:20] <kbrooks> $50 is even better
[12:20] <mwe> Techno_2: the ubuntu options are all enabled
[12:20] <kbrooks> Hexidigital_: please.
[12:20] <kbrooks> Hexidigital_: shhh/
[12:20] <glick> Hexidigital_: there is nothing wrong with selling software
[12:20] <glick> it would still be open and freely available for download
[12:20] <glick> but most people have a thing with if its free it must be no good
[12:20] <Mysta_> for a cost?
[12:20] <Hexidigital_> kbrooks:: :)
[12:20] <Techno_2> mwe: The documentation for suspend2 tells me to enable several options that I didn't
[12:21] <Hexidigital_> glick:: i concur
[12:21] <Mysta_> the internet is free? is that good? hehehe
[12:21] <Hexidigital_> glick:: i did a research paper about that in college
[12:21] <mwe> Techno_2: oh
[12:21] <firestorm> when is the internet free?
[12:21] <kbrooks> Mysta_: no, its not free
[12:21] <dauoalagio> whats a good music program for gnome>
[12:21] <dauoalagio> ?
[12:21] <Mysta_> its free for me
[12:21] <Mortal`> Mysta_, Internet is free, as in free* ;)
[12:21] <mwe> Techno_2: yeah make sure those are enabled
[12:21] <Mysta_> lol
[12:21] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: internet is not free... you pay your ISP
[12:21] <Techno_2> mwe: Ok I didn't actually need them
[12:21] <Mysta_> i dont pay a dime actually
[12:21] <kbrooks> Mortal`: * free as in speech
[12:21] <Techno_2> Oh well, they might be useful (Sorry for the two lined writing)
[12:21] <mwe> Techno_2: now cd /usr/src/linux and make && make modules_install then
[12:22] <firestorm> If your at college look at your bill you pay a technology fee
[12:22] <Hexidigital_> Mortal`:: was that implying *With purchase of connection from ISP?
[12:22] <kbrooks> hmm
[12:22] <Mortal`> Hexidigital_, yes :)
[12:22] <Hexidigital_> :)
[12:22] <kbrooks> i feell like reinstalling fedora, over ubuntu. :-)
[12:22] <Techno_2> mwe: Not sudo make?
[12:22] <patch> know somebody where can I find MBrola ?
[12:22] <Mysta_> well technically you aren't paying for the internet, you're paying for a connection to the internet
[12:22] <mwe> Techno_2: try updating menu.lst in the meantime. you need to create a brand new entry
[12:22] <mwe> Techno_2: you don't need sudo
[12:22] <Mortal`> kbrooks, that's not :-), thats )-: ;)
[12:23] <mwe> Techno_2: not if youre root
[12:23] <mwe> Techno_2: just type make && make modules_install
[12:23] <Techno_2> mwe; Ah ok, I see the fucntion of sudo now
[12:23] <kbrooks> then again, i dont think i will reinstall.
[12:23] <mwe> yeah
[12:23] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: www.apache.org
[12:23] <glick> Hexidigital_: so if your agreeing with me why are you telling me to go to the windows channel?
[12:24] <Hexidigital_> glick:: it was a joke :)
[12:24] <kbrooks> glick; BAD JOKE
[12:24] <cvasilak> hello there, what is the name of the package for the nvidia-kernel smp version (dapper drake)
[12:24] <Hexidigital_> yes, i guess it was a bad one :)
[12:24] <Mysta_> Hexidigital_: what about apache?
[12:24] <kbrooks> ?
[12:24] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: that has all the doc for apache (you were looking for doc right?)
[12:24] <kurt> is there any xgl guide that works floating about on the internet?
[12:24] <gnomefreak> cvasilak: try #ubuntu+1 please for dapper
[12:24] <gnomefreak> kurt: #ubuntu-xgl
[12:25] <Mysta_> Hexidigital_: oh no im sorry, im trying to figure out what the diff is between a regular install of ubuntu or a server install
[12:25] <mwe> Techno_2: you can copy paste an existing entry in menu.lst. just change the image name. you'll probably call the image vmlinuz-2.6.16.18
[12:25] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: server will not install GUI by default
[12:25] <CaptainMorgan> anyone know how I can thunderbird to display IN the screen? right now, it's width is exceeding my screen's width and there's no up/down, left/right arrows to view the missing content
[12:25] <Mysta_> Hexidigital_: im guessing gnome and all that sfuff
[12:25] <CaptainMorgan> *get
[12:25] <gnomefreak> Mysta_: server installs no gui most things are for running a server
[12:25] <Mysta_> Hexidigital_: is that it?
[12:25] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: you are better off with default, than installing what you need
[12:25] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: yes
[12:25] <NickGarvey> what does the file /boot/boot do?
[12:25] <mcphail> kurt: got xgl working today. Very pleased with myself :)
[12:26] <NickGarvey> oh nevermind I forgot, its a recursive link haha
[12:26] <NickGarvey> I'm in windows and its flipping out
[12:26] <issaker> aye
[12:26] <issaker> the dualbooting guide doesnt help
[12:26] <Mysta_> gnomefreak and Hexidigital_: does that go for lets say vmware server? should i do a standard install?
[12:26] <issaker> i didnt resize anything
[12:26] <magikfingerz> Hi everybody! How are you in this EXCELLENT day...? :)
[12:26] <gnomefreak> vmware is not installed under any ubunut install
[12:26] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: yes, standard
[12:26] <mcphail> kurt: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto is a decent link
[12:26] <glick> i think the gnome people have the right idea on what a desktop should be all about
[12:27] <gnomefreak> ubuntu even
[12:27] <dauoalagio> whats a good music player?
[12:27] <glick> i disagree with the kde philosophy and i disagree with linux
[12:27] <glick> urrr
[12:27] <Mysta_> issaker: you split a 200 gig drive into 2 100 gig drives right?
[12:27] <glick> i mean i disagree with Linus
[12:27] <Mysta_> thanks gnomefreak and Hexidigital_
[12:27] <CaptainMorgan> ok
[12:27] <gnomefreak> glick: please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:27] <issaker> yah but i did that while installing xp pro mysta_
[12:27] <jvai> the default rythymnbox is good, but it's hard to sync radio tsations to it
[12:27] <Mysta_> issaker: ok
[12:27] <Hexidigital_> glick:: let me elaborate a bit.  i agree that not enough people use linux because of the "if it's free, it cannot be good" philosophy
[12:27] <magikfingerz> dauoalagio, well xmms is a good player, but if you want a good-looking player amarok shoud interest you too
[12:27] <firestorm> glick, the main thing I hate about kde is konqueror I hate all in one tools
[12:28] <mwe> Hexidigital_: ubuntu-offtopic
[12:28] <Hexidigital_> Mysta_:: no problem
[12:28] <Hexidigital_> sorry, mwe
[12:28] <CaptainMorgan> konq stinks
[12:28] <hanasaki> in kernel 2.6.x  is there a way to tell the kernel to dump all its cached stuff?
[12:28] <gnomefreak> dauoalagio: depends on what you are trying to play
[12:28] <glick> firestorm: yeah thats one of many things that urk me
[12:28] <issaker> mysta_ so that couldnt be a resize problem right?
[12:28] <Mysta_> issaker: i'd say no it isn't
[12:28] <logicirc> Is there a nice GUI I can use to manage the mounting of partitions?
[12:28] <glick> firestorm: you need to know like a bajillion options to get it working the way you want
[12:29] <gnomefreak> glick: firestorm and CaptainMorgan take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:29] <issaker> so do you have any idea what it could be?
[12:29] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: windows IS booting... perhaps the ##windows channel can help you, but your dual boot config is correct
[12:29] <glick> gnomefreak: chill dude
[12:29] <Mysta_> issaker: im thinkin
[12:29] <Mysta_> ouch
[12:29] <CaptainMorgan> what?
[12:29] <CaptainMorgan> Im asking about tb
[12:29] <glick> whats your beef gnomefreak ?
[12:29] <CaptainMorgan> hardly offtopic
[12:29] <glick> were just talkin man?
[12:29] <glick> jesus
[12:29] <gnomefreak> glick: i asked you to take it to offtopic
[12:30] <gnomefreak> glick: this channel is a support channel not a general chat channel
[12:30] <glick> gnomefreak: gnome is hardly off topic in the ubuntu chanel
[12:30] <gnomefreak> glick: gnome and kde comparing is it has nothing to do with suppoort
[12:30] <glick> gnomefreak: no one besides you cares
[12:30] <gnomefreak> glick: i wouldnt fight this anymore just take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:31] <kspath> glick: I care but I am new to the channel.
[12:31] <logicirc> Is there a GUI available for managing the mounting of partitions?
[12:31] <patch> Where can I get MBrola ?
[12:31] <slime> sorry for my english, I have a problem
[12:31] <Techno_2> What does it matter <_<
[12:31] <Mysta_> glick: i'd quit while ur ahead
[12:31] <Hexidigital_> slime:: what's the problem?
[12:31] <gnomefreak> abr glick ive asked you to move it to #offtopic
[12:31] <slime> can help me?
[12:31] <mwe> Techno_2: I need to go. when the kernel is compiled, cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.16.18 and update /boot/grub/menu.lst according to the README from suspend2. be aware that update-grub might mess up menu.lst when the ubuntu kernel (not the one your compiling) is updated. ask in the channel for how to avoid that. basically put the new entry in menu.lst out of the automatic section.
[12:31] <firestorm> How do I go about creating a directory so that anything inside of it (including new directorys) retain the permission of that folder
[12:31] <Techno_2> mwe: Thank you for all your helo
[12:31] <mwe> Techno_2: yw
[12:31] <slime> at start
[12:31] <Techno_2> help*
[12:32] <mwe> good luck
[12:32] <Hexidigital_> slime:: no need to press enter after every couple words
[12:32] <slime> enterprise management system!
[12:32] <CaptainMorgan> well, back to my original q; How do I alter tb so that my message *fits* within the screen... right now, it is wider than screens length and there is no left/right bar to see the missing portions of the message. looked in view and didnt' see anything that could help
[12:33] <CaptainMorgan> bug?
[12:33] <hanasaki> in kernel 2.6.x  is there a way to tell the kernel to dump all its cached stuff?
[12:33] <Mysta_> CaptainMorgan: whats tb?
[12:33] <slime> when I start it proces arerest the starting for more minute
[12:34] <CaptainMorgan> thundabird
[12:34] <Mysta_> oh lol

[12:34] <lun4tic> dows anyone know how i can get the windows key on my keyboard sticky again like strg, alt and shift?
[12:34] <Mysta_> slime: so when you start arerest it takes a while to load?
[12:35] <CaptainMorgan> only the message is wider. the whole application fits within screen.. but not the message... weird
[12:35] <aLPHa_LeaK> lun4tic: pour coke over it ;)
[12:35] <CaptainMorgan> maybe I need to ask #thunderbird..
[12:35] <CaptainMorgan> nope.. only three folks there

[12:39] <lun4tic> aLPHa_LeaK: the windows key normally should behave like any other meta key (alt, shift, strg) but it doesn't
[12:39] <rredd4> Mysta  yes
[12:39] <kbrooks> how do I backup a Linux installation?
[12:40] <logicirc> Is there a tool to configure partition mount points via GUI?

[12:40] <rubberduck_sp> Gparted
[12:40] <Silk> anyone good with sound problems?

[12:41] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, hit google up for mondoarchive
[12:42] <lun4tic> it is currently not cusomized so it has the standard kubuntu behaviour
[12:42] <kbrooks> LinuxJones: open source?
[12:42] <rredd4> kbrooks ty
[12:42] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, GPL all the way :)
[12:42] <Silk> Anyone know how to get audio working in Dapper Drake? Getting no sound out of any port
[12:42] <kbrooks> LinuxJones: application?
[12:42] <Silk> any totem, mplayer
[12:42] <Silk> dvd
[12:42] <kbrooks> LinuxJones: is it a program?
[12:42] <rubberduck_sp> Silk, i got itplaying with the mixer, headphone detection, etc... but this is a mac XD
[12:42] <mcphail> lun4tic: you haven't installed xgl/compiz?
[12:42] <lun4tic> in other KDE desktops (like on my debian/unstable) the windows key doesn't repeat but on that kubuntu desktop it does
[12:43] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, you ever need to install/push out upgrades to a number of machines check out system installation suite, it's pretty awesome :)
[12:43] <Jowi> Techno_2: depends on 1) your CPU. 2) how you set up the kernel and 3) number of modules. on my 1ghz machine it takes about 20minutes, with alot of modules removed and only what i need compiled in.
[12:43] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, yeah it's in the universe repo
[12:43] <lun4tic> mcphail: xgl is running but compiz is not
[12:43] <lun4tic> mcphail: is it a xgl problem?
[12:43] <kbrooks> LinuxJones: ok. i have fedora, so i'll look in there for mondoarchive.
[12:43] <Techno_2> Jowi: So with a reasonable CPU, a follow someone elses instructiosn setup, and uselss moduels installed it'll take hours :P
[12:44] <Jowi> Techno_2: after you've done it once, next times are very quick. 25% of total time roughly
[12:44] <Jowi> Techno_2: very hard to estimate :)
[12:44] <LinuxJones> kbrooks, here's a link to a LinuxJournal article >> http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/6808/print
[12:44] <mcphail> lun4tic: don't think so. I think it is compiz which hijacks Super_L

[12:45] <kbrooks> gnomefreak: thhat was a bad person.
[12:45] <Techno_2> Jowi: How big is the kernel?
[12:45] <Silk> So any tips on how to get sound output going? I've check alsa-mixer nothing is muted, I've plugged headphones into every jack nothing soudn cards detecting right just never get any audio out...
[12:45] <Jowi> Techno_2: the hard part of compiling a kernel is to remove unwanted stuff. there are alot of info on the drivers to read through in the kernel setup (menuconfig/gconfig etc)
[12:45] <rubberduck_sp> there is a load of new libs with dapper, I had to download 1024 nes packages

[01:01] <Jowi> Manticewoot: if i remember correctly you can sync the sound by pressing Z or X or something like that...
[01:02] <axiom> Mantice, is the video choppy or is the sound simply out of sync?
[01:02] <KaiL> Manticewoot, try xine, has normally less such problems ;) or just get a CPU above 500Mhz :p
[01:02] <Manticewoot> Sounds perfect
[01:02] <Manticewoot> The video just lags
[01:02] <r3k13m> mcphail, i can do that in kde but in gnome not, in system->prefs->keyboard shortcuts there are only to move up,down,right, how i can rotate??

[01:04] <KaiL> or only to slow to keep the sync?

[01:11] <Jowi> rab: no, you have to enable universe and/or multiverse yourself
[01:12] <Jowi> rab: read the link that ubotu gave you. step-by-step instructions :)
[01:12] <rab> jowi, oh well it doesnt say how to do it throught command line
[01:12] <rab> nv
[01:12] <rab> nvm
[01:12] <rab> i see
[01:12] <mmia> Would someone explain why I don't have write access on my vfat partitions even if I specify "rw" and umask=000
[01:12] <mmia> ?
[01:12] <bthornton> Is ndiswrapper known to not play friendly with NetworkManager, or does it just depend on the hardware?
[01:12] <mmia> in my /etc/fstab
[01:12] <FlyingSquirrel32> nevermind.
[01:13] <devnull> wpa keeps talking about passphrase's and the ap's i am tryin to connect to do not have passphrases ? how can i connect to them ?
[01:13] <Jowi> mmia: post your fstab in pastebin and i can have a look
[01:13] <Vraptor> Anyone have suggestions on how to get sound working correctly?
[01:13] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: im using ndiswrapper and networkmanager right now
[01:13] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: What hardware?
[01:13] <devnull> actually how do you connect to anything besides a wep AP that doesn't use a passphrase and any wpa AP ?
[01:13] <Manticewoot> KaiL where can I get xine ?
[01:13] <GatoLoko> hi
[01:13] <KillerKiwi2006> Linksys wireless card it was a broadcom chip
[01:13] <KillerKiwi2006> has
[01:13] <bthornton> Basically, NetworkManager works with the very experimental Broadcom (bcm43xx) driver on my system, but not with ndiswrapper.
[01:13] <jhenn> hi. what does restricted copyright mean in the synaptic?
[01:14] <Vraptor> blacklist the broadcom drivers that come with ubuntu run ndiswrapper and install your drivers
[01:14] <KaiL> KillerKiwi2006, PCMCIA?
[01:14] <KillerKiwi2006> yes
[01:14] <devnull> bthornton, i haven't had problems with ndiswrapper and network manager ... my problem is with WPA
[01:14] <Manticewoot> could it be that I dont have any graphics drivers ? thats why my video is going ot of sync ?
[01:14] <KaiL> Manticewoot, xine-ui is the package name (in universe)
[01:14] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: did you black list the kernel driver?
[01:14] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: Yep
[01:14] <GatoLoko> I am thinking about helping with the Spanish translations of Ubuntu. Is there some guidelines about Rosetta or something similar that I must read before?
[01:14] <bthornton> maybe I need to reboot...
[01:14] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: did you install the win drivers from the cd?
[01:14] <bthornton> that feels weird to have to do in Linux tho
[01:14] <devnull> GatoLoko, that documentation should be on the ubuntu website
[01:14] <mmia> Jowi: do you have a log of #pastebin
[01:14] <mmia> ?
[01:15] <KaiL> GatoLoko, too late for dapper - no new translations after the RC :/
[01:15] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: No, I used one of the driver links as provided in the docs
[01:15] <Vraptor> I've RTFM, edited alsa-base, configured gstreamer-setup and am just starting to think I'm not going to have sound in linux.
[01:15] <Jowi> mmia: /msg ubotu pastebin
[01:15] <KaiL> bad enough, as some visible strings got changed :(
[01:15] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: It's a bit trickier for me because I've got a 64-bit system, so I must be using 64-bit drivers.
[01:15] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: I just used the drivers on my cd / have to copy them to the HD frist though or it fails
[01:16] <Jowi> mmia: i should have been clearer maybe :)
[01:16] <Jowi> !pastebin
[01:16] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[01:16] <devnull> bthornton, honestly i would not use the 64bit install
[01:16] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: ahh well that could be it :)
[01:16] <devnull> i have a turion chip and had issues with gentoo and ubuntu in 64bit version because not everything is 64bit ready yet
[01:16] <Manticewoot> I had Ubuntu 64 bit its a pain in the ass to look for stuff that works with 64 bit
[01:16] <GatoLoko> devnull I know, but I'm asking if somebody can tell me about a "must read"
[01:16] <devnull> GatoLoko, okay sorry about that .... i haven't really read through the docs on writing docs
[01:16] <KaiL> devnull, not already switched to i386?
[01:17] <GatoLoko> KaiL i'm not talking about dapper, but ubuntu in general, edgy and next
[01:17] <devnull> kail: ?
[01:17] <KaiL> edgy *should* get better amd64 support - let's hope..
[01:17] <devnull> well as far as i know i had a very unpleasant time with ubuntu and gentoo 64 because i am using the latest and development software
[01:18] <devnull> though it seems the ATI drivers actually worked better with the 64bit version
[01:18] <devnull> but on top of that i didn't notice any speed increases over i386
[01:18] <mmia> There, I posted my fstab.
[01:19] <Afief> guys, is there a way to easily reconfigure X? i think i messed up my configuration file without keeping a backup
[01:19] <KillerKiwi2006> devnull: I've screwd my opengl for my ati card... I have no idea how to fix it it worked from default install to ... :)
[01:19] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, i would try removing all ATI drivers and software all together including kernel drivers and reinstall all of them
[01:19] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, unfortunately depending on your card support is non existant
[01:19] <KaiL> ...and still nobody knowing about WMV9 + gstreamer? :)
[01:19] <KillerKiwi2006> devnull: I know...
[01:19] <devnull> i would never suggest an ATI card for linux
[01:20] <KillerKiwi2006> devnull: Nvida for my next latop i think
[01:20] <devnull> KaiL, idk anything about wmv9 but there are packages of extra codecs
[01:20] <g-nome> whickh laptop sells with nvidia and is good?
[01:20] <KaiL> devnull, yes, w32codecs
[01:20] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, yea same thing here ... this ati card in linux kills me
[01:20] <ZeXr0> Is there a way to install Ubuntu with a Wifi Card ?
[01:20] <RemyLaptop> hi guys, does anyone know much about the "at" command ?
[01:20] <KaiL> but to get them to work with gstreamer is the problem
[01:20] <crimsun> KaiL: no GSt support for it afaik.
[01:20] <devnull> kail there is more than likely another package or 2
[01:20] <KillerKiwi2006> devnull: no xgl magic is sad....
[01:21] <RemyLaptop> !tell KaiL about wifi
[01:21] <Vraptor> I was using xgl on an ati card
[01:21] <RemyLaptop> !tell ZeXr0 about wifi
[01:21] <RemyLaptop> :-)
[01:21] <KaiL> RemyLaptop, ;)
[01:21] <RemyLaptop> my bad :-P
[01:21] <Jowi> mmia: try this instead: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14695
[01:21] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, yea i wanted xgl aswell but if you think about it, if you are using battery power with xgl you will run the battery down faster because of the use of the 3dcard
[01:21] <KaiL> crimsun, there's gstreamer0.10-pitfdll
[01:21] <mcphail> RemyLaptop: I've used at before, but need to go back to the man pages...
[01:21] <KaiL> only problem: it doesn't work
[01:21] <Afief> guys, is there a way to easily reconfigure X? i think i messed up my configuration file without keeping a backup
[01:21] <crimsun> KaiL: last I checked that was hardly native.
[01:21] <RemyLaptop> I've read the man pages, but I'm not altogether convinced I've gotten the syntax right
[01:22] <RemyLaptop> I'm looking up examples of use atm
[01:22] <ryanakca> tcp6       0      0 *:www                   *:*                     LISTEN             =        Port 80 to any client, on ipv6   ?
[01:22] <RemyLaptop> should fix it for me :)
[01:22] <Jowi> mmia: add utf-8 if needed
[01:22] <mcphail> Afief: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[01:22] <KillerKiwi2006> devnull: But i love the 3d cube thingy
=== jack is now known as jack-
[01:22] <devnull> i stopped trying to get the ati drivers to work because it was more important to have a stable system for me
[01:22] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, who doesn't
[01:22] <ZeXr0> RemyLaptop : I know how wifi works, I was just wondering if I can install Ubuntu with my wifi connection ?
[01:22] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, you should be able to get the drivers working with GL and have XGL running even with ATI but it might take a few days to get it setup correctly
[01:22] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: You got XGL working on your lappy?
[01:22] <RemyLaptop> you mean install it OVER a wifi connection ?
[01:23] <ZeXr0> yup
[01:23] <devnull> and if you try to do it. do it one step at a time and don't change to much in one shot
[01:23] <KaiL> devnull, du you have numbers, about how much more power is needed for Xgl?
[01:23] <RemyLaptop> I'm afraid I don't know :)
[01:23] <KillerKiwi2006> bthornton: I did.... not any more :)
[01:23] <GTroy_> this is off topic, but what's the first language taught for comp sci at mit?
[01:23] <_mason> Hey, How do i set the port in BitTorrent, port 6881 is blacklisted ?
[01:23] <Jowi> mmia: i can really say if ntfs has proper write support though or if it is still experimental (never had a ntfs partition)
[01:23] <GTroy_> sorry for the off-topic guys
[01:23] <judah> wifi connection is just like ethernet.. just with now wires.
[01:23] <devnull> KaiL, i wouldnt image it being much .. but if you are using your graphics card's 3d power you will use more actuall power than 2d
[01:23] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: FWIW, I'm running a laptop with ATI video with Dapper and I have OpenGL working great with just fglrx drivers provided in... Multiverse?  I think.
[01:23] <judah> so the answer is yes.. as long as the card is supported by the install cd.
[01:24] <KaiL> ZeXr0, ubuntu doesn't have any "netinstall" afaik, but if you mean installing the language-packs, it should work
[01:24] <bthornton> KillerKiwi2006: Incidently, even though OGL runs great, XGL never did :(
[01:24] <cerberused> yello people!
[01:24] <devnull> imagine
[01:24] <judah> (updates after install maybe.. ;) )
[01:24] <titanium_platypu> after 5-10 minutes of playing pretty much any 3d-accelerated game, the screen slowly fades to total blackness, and I can't seem to fix it anyway except restarting X
[01:24] <ZeXr0> Oh.. I thought the install was like Debian, if not then that should be perfect
[01:24] <titanium_platypu> what is going on?
[01:24] <KaiL> at least with ipw2100/2200/3945 it does ;)
[01:24] <judah> one cd install..
[01:24] <judah> then updates from the network.
[01:24] <devnull> titanium_platypu, what graphics card
[01:25] <Techno_2> What is "initrd"?
[01:25] <[nige] > hi all
[01:25] <titanium_platypu> NVidia GeForce MX 4000
[01:25] <KaiL> titanium_platypu, shoulds like the screensaver
[01:25] <judah> NAME
[01:25] <judah>        initrd - boot loader initialized RAM disk
[01:25] <Techno_2> Do I need it?
[01:25] <titanium_platypu> hm....disable the screensaver and try?
[01:25] <cerberused> &*% HIHI people! ^_^
[01:25] <KaiL> play a bit with the keyboard and it should come back...
[01:25] <KillerKiwi2006> jhenn: Give my another way and i will use it
[01:25] <titanium_platypu> nah, I thought that and tried it.
[01:25] <titanium_platypu> it didn't work.
[01:25] <devnull> titanium_platypu, make sure you have the latest nvidia drivers and kernel driver ... im rather certain the nvidia drivers work very well with most nvidia cards
[01:25] <Vraptor> Need Help Sound doesn't play Dapper Drake 6.06 intel onboard sound alc658
[01:26] <Vraptor> no errors all volumes un muted
[01:26] <titanium_platypu> yeah, I do have the latest drivers
[01:26] <devnull> titanium_platypu, you can try that
[01:26] <titanium_platypu> okay
[01:26] <titanium_platypu> thanks
[01:26] <ShadowShuriken> hey guyz
[01:26] <crimsun> Vraptor: pastebin the output from ``lspci -v && tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat && amixer''
[01:26] <devnull> actually nvidia's linux support is great
[01:26] <judah> Techno_2: ubuntu's kernel does use initrd to boot their kernels.
[01:26] <jhenn> KillerKiwi2006: write your own drivers or protest at ATI to get them to release specs
[01:26] <mcphail> titanium_platypu: you maybe need the "legacy" driver for that card?
[01:26] <devnull> Techno_2, if you are using a ubuntu kernel yes
[01:27] <AngryElf> hey guys what's the syntax for cat to add a string to the end of a file??  i would think it'd be something like    cat file "string" > new_file  but obviously that's not working
[01:27] <judah> file /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-22-686
[01:27] <judah> /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-22-686: gzip compressed data, from Unix, max compression
[01:27] <KaiL> jhenn, ATi at least gives spec for older hardware....
[01:27] <gymsmoke> i've been looking through some of the docs on the upcoming dapper release...
[01:27] <gymsmoke> cat >> file
[01:27] <KaiL> nVidia doesn't :/
[01:27] <jhenn> KaiL: nice
[01:27] <mcphail> AngryElf: use two >
[01:27] <devnull> KillerKiwi2006, i would suggest searching the net and see if anyone else has the same specs as you and has it working
[01:27] <KillerKiwi2006> jhenn: I have do disire to spend years writing drivers sorry
[01:27] <gymsmoke> there's a couple of forum threads saying _not_ to use dapper as a primary os / desktop
[01:27] <kspath> AngryElf:  > is redirect   >> is append
[01:27] <KaiL> but with nVidia you doesn't need to wait until the card is hopeless outdated, to get a WORKING driver ;)
[01:27] <jhenn> KillerKiwi2006: well where would we be with that attitude?
[01:27] <devnull> doesn't bother me if nvidia doesn't give up specs as long as they keep releasing drivers
[01:28] <jhenn> KillerKiwi2006: there would be no gnu/linux for you to use.
[01:28] <jhenn> devnull: and that will be your downfall
[01:28] <devnull> i can't even remember what i had to do on my last install to get my ATI drivers to work correctly
[01:28] <gymsmoke> if breezy is supposed to be updated to dapper, why is that possible?
[01:28] <jvai>  cant ait to upgraqde to dapper, on hoary now, but.. hoary is sooo sweet!, easy ubuntu, got me set up nicely, dvd playback, & any windows media.. i'll wait.....
[01:28] <devnull> jhenn, probably but their drivers for linux kick ass compared to any other company
[01:29] <KillerKiwi2006> jhenn: Got to be honest I wish all drivers were open, i konw they never will be due to stupid american patents, and by the time the driver is reverese enginered I ll have a new latop with a new card
[01:29] <KaiL> devnull, you doesn't need to memorize that - it's always some different voodoo ;)
[01:29] <imichel> my computer couldn't install ubuntu
[01:29] <cerberused> S-O-N-I-C     R-O-C-K-S     O-N     L-I-N-U-X!!!!
[01:29] <KaiL> imichel, how that?
[01:29] <gymsmoke> no,but you could install ubuntu on your computer ;)
[01:29] <Jowi> gymsmoke: breezy and dapper are different releases. you can still use breezy for another year or so supported. dapper is in RC atm
[01:29] <jhenn> devnull: KillerKiwi2006 then i have nothing more to say to you two. bye.
[01:29] <devnull> KaiL, yea i know it is silly ... but not only that but if i did remember what i did i probably have to change half of my system
[01:29] <Vraptor> http://pastebin.com/740323
[01:29] <AngryElf> kspath, mcphail i think you missed my point......i want to add a string to the end of a file, in one command.....id ont want to do the cat command and then type stuff in
[01:29] <mcphail> gymsmoke: dapper hasn't been released yet, so it is still "unstable"
[01:29] <Vraptor> sorry took me a while
[01:30] <devnull> cool
[01:30] <mcphail> AngryElf: use "echo"
[01:30] <gymsmoke> right, but it's due for release next month, yeah ?
[01:30] <Techno_2> Thank you for all your help
[01:30] <Techno_2> It's time to reboot
[01:30] <KaiL> gymsmoke, 6 days from now
[01:30] <KaiL> or 5...
[01:30] <jvai> techno.. u on win xp?
[01:30] <KaiL> at least 2006-06-01
[01:30] <cappiz> i configured to NICS at my computer... one is WAN and one is wired NIC... the WAN is the one wich holds the inet connection. but when i configured the second, wich om gonan use for my internal router (dhcp)... the WAN stops working. when i try to ping i get LAN IP _ DEstination host unrechable
[01:30] <Jowi> gymsmoke: but you don't need to upgrade if you don't want :)
[01:30] <Techno_2> This was my first kernal recompiling
[01:30] <devnull> yea i am not seeking to get my 3d working ... as long as my laptop stay stable i need it to work so i can't mess around with ATI's crap drivers for the moment
[01:30] <cappiz> how can that be configured correctly ?
[01:30] <Techno_2> Bye :)
[01:30] <mmia> Jowi: I do not have it on vfat either.  I know that you can't chmod it cuz it's faked.
[01:31] <mmia> Actually
[01:31] <mmia> what I realized is-----
[01:31] <KaiL> devnull, which card?
[01:31] <gymsmoke> KaiL: so with all of th questionable functionality and a release date of approximately one week, there must be thousands of people working round the clock to finish it...
[01:31] <Jowi> mmia: wrong /dev ?
[01:31] <devnull> radion X200m
[01:31] <mmia> I needed to set the permissions for users, before I mounted the vfat partition on that directory
[01:31] <mmia> .
[01:31] <nzx> hey, i'm trying to run this command 'evrouter /dev/input/event4 > /dev/null' when gnome loads, but it wont work, please help
[01:31] <Jowi> mmia: ah
[01:31] <KaiL> gymsmoke, why?
[01:31] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, hey could u helpme out?
[01:31] <KaiL> it works VERY good for me, not for you?
[01:31] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, whats you question
[01:32] <devnull> kail: me ?
[01:32] <mmia> That was the way, apparently, that I got my write access.
[01:32] <KaiL> devnull, the vga chip, yes
[01:32] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, well...i've got ubuntu...and i wanna do sumthing with it...but i have no clue of what to do :(
[01:32] <gymsmoke> KaiL: a production release within a week, and the forums, user lists, and channels are full of threads about what's broke in dapper
[01:32] <devnull> 2d works fine ... i just dont have the time to mess with the 3d drivers for it at the moment ... i can't have this lappy down for more than a day or i will lose to much time
[01:32] <crimsun> Vraptor: in a Terminal, type: amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 0 && amixer set 'Duplicate Front' on
[01:33] <Bung> hey, ive got to reformat my other comp, should i backup anything other then my home directory?
[01:33] <mcphail> gymsmoke: erm, that's what beta testing is all about...
[01:33] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, it helps to know what you want to do first
[01:33] <eobanb> yay for Picasa on ubuntu! some screenshots i took: http://eoban.com/fileserve/images/picasa-linux/
[01:33] <KaiL> gymsmoke, how many pebcak problems are between that? I guess maaaaany ;)
[01:33] <devnull> bung ... i like to backup my webroot and /usr/local
[01:33] <Vraptor> done
[01:33] <gymsmoke> KaiL: ?pebcak?
[01:33] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, u see thats kinda the prob...i wanna make stuff and customize and everything...and play wargames..
[01:33] <crimsun> Vraptor: now, ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
[01:33] <KaiL> gymsmoke, layer8-error
[01:33] <Bung> devnull, webroot, meaning if i had a webserver running?
[01:34] <KaiL> or just "stupid user"
[01:34] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, if you are just looking for stuff to do you can check out your ART's manager to change you background's, login screens, and splash screen
[01:34] <devnull> there is an entire menu for preferences for gnome aswell
[01:34] <gymsmoke> KaiL: probably quite a few... i've seen a large number of those with any linux...
[01:34] <devnull> Bung, yes .. probably /var/www
[01:34] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, i kinda got that part... but i wanna create apps and stuff...
[01:34] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, yet i'm new to...programming in c..
[01:35] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, i would look into what kind of apps you want to make first
[01:35] <Bung> devnull: yea ok, ill check out my /usr/local too, thanks
[01:35] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, web related..
[01:35] <gymsmoke> KaiL: so, if the bulkl of those issues are operator error, then dapper will probably be a stable platform when released...
[01:35] <devnull> bung ... possibly back up /etc
[01:35] <gymsmoke> ^bulk
[01:35] <Abo> eveytime I run a svn command on ubuntu, nano opens a temp svn file... all I have to do is close it (^X) and then click "c" for (Continue), anyone knows the reason?
[01:35] <KaiL> I don't think, that spending much more time will fix a relevant number of bugs
[01:35] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, i would get yourself a editor for webpages first and learn Layout and HTML ... then i would suggest PHP for scripting webpages or even Ruby for Ruby on Rails
[01:36] <mcphail> ShadowShuriken: writing "web-related" apps in C is not an easy process
[01:36] <KaiL> the only thing, which REALLY didn't work well for dapper are the localisations
[01:36] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, yea i would learn a Scripting language before I would learn C for web programming
[01:36] <AngryElf> so i'm trying to add a string to the end of /etc/hosts using a command......."sudo string >> /etc/hosts" gives me perm denied....any other way?
[01:36] <ShadowShuriken> mcphail, hmm...well...i know html, csss and whatnot...
[01:36] <KaiL> gymsmoke, did you thy it for your own?
[01:36] <Bung> devnull, that would be if id done any extra configuring for X or something eh? I think its all default stuff there for me :)
[01:36] <devnull> i know c/c++/java but use Scripting languages like PHP/Perl/Ruby for web apps
[01:36] <crimsun> AngryElf: echo "string" |sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
[01:36] <baconbacon> "not an easy process" is a big understatement
[01:36] <Jowi> ShadowShuriken: you have a lot to choose from. gambas is cool. kinda like VisualBasic. a RAD tool for creating apps. Anjuta work well. you can also go with Python or Perl or Java or any other flavour of launguages.
[01:36] <mcphail> ShadowShuriken: Trust me, you don't want to use C for the web.
[01:37] <devnull> bung: yea if you had to configure anything yourself i would copy /etc just incase .. but if all is default than I wouldn't worry about it
[01:37] <ShadowShuriken> mcphail, lol...is it really complicated?
[01:37] <ShadowShuriken> mcphail, what about asp and...xml?
[01:37] <Abo> anyone knows of a svn/ubuntu IRC channel?
[01:37] <AngryElf> thanx crimsun
[01:37] <Bung> devnull: thanks again man! im out.
[01:38] <mcphail> ShadowShuriken: not complicated: C is a very simple language. But if you don't know what you are doing (parsing input etc) you will be pwned in no time.
[01:38] <Vraptor> hmm
[01:38] <baconbacon> ShadowShuriken: as i said about C web coding :  "not an easy process" is a big understatement
[01:38] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, don't worry about ASP if you are using anyting other than Windows .... i would suggest Apache webserver with PHP4 or 5 and there are like a million tutorials and docs to get you started
[01:38] <Vraptor> now its doing almost a screaming beep
[01:38] <devnull> if you need a Database get MySQL
[01:38] <Vraptor> when I start the startup.wav it loads but sound is all distorted and crazy
[01:39] <Vraptor> and theres this constat tone
[01:39] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, well... i need to setup a small server b4..i can do that rite?
[01:39] <Techno_2> I've compiled a downloaded kernel, but I'm not sure how to use grub to boot it
[01:39] <devnull> to setup a webserver in ubuntu all you will need is apache2
[01:39] <HIHello> HI,having trouble with screen resolution...It wont show options for over 60Hz and 1024-768 in screen resolution preferences,any ideas on how to change to 1440-900 on my LCD which is using analog right now.
[01:39] <majd> hi
[01:39] <devnull> which will create /var/www as your webroot which you can reach at http://localhost
[01:39] <majd> i get this message whenever i try to run upgrade
[01:39] <majd> It is impossible to install or remove any software. Please use the package manager "Synaptic" or run "sudo apt-get install -f" in a terminal to fix this issue at first.
[01:40] <majd> i guess i should try what it says before asking....
[01:40] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, and i would also like a small file server...to which windows/ubuntu pcs can connect...
[01:40] <devnull> majd go to a terminal and do sudo apt-get install -f
[01:40] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, setup Samba then for that
[01:40] <majd> devnull, yeah i'm sorry i'm an idiot
[01:40] <devnull> majd not an idiot just not an expert
[01:40] <HIHello> HI,having trouble with screen resolution...It wont show options for over 60Hz and 1024-768 in screen resolution preferences,any ideas on how to change to 1440-900 on my LCD which is using analog right now.

[01:41] <Jowi> Techno_2: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto
[01:41] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, you need to setup samba first and it probably will allow you to see PC's .... wont help you find linux boxes
[01:41] <blaze> where is the ubuntu startup file and how can i add new applications to it?

[01:42] <granden> Hi, which package of w32codecs should I get for ubuntu dapper drake?
[01:43] <Meshack> I am currently demoing the live cd version of ubuntu. When I boot using the live cd all the hardware seems to work fine except no sound from soundcard. I checked to see if mute was set however it proved to be ok. Next I checked device manager to see if my sound card was recognized by ubuntu. Yep it found my sound card fine but still no sound. Help?

[01:43] <issaker> does anyone know how i can switch the harddrive that has a windows partition to a different harddrive controller ?
[01:43] <devnull> ShadowShuriken, a local domain or a Domain Name ?

[01:44] <granden> Anyone?
[01:44] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, SBS
[01:45] <issaker> quick question
[01:45] <Meshack> Thanks crimsum for the help.
[01:45] <kspath> granden: /msg ubotu w32codecs
[01:45] <devnull> well if it is public server you need a domain name and you can just use subdomains for your servers
[01:45] <devnull> if it is internal servers IDK
[01:45] <ShadowShuriken> devnull, o ok...
[01:45] <majd> !upgrade
[01:45] <ubotu> well, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.

[01:49] <Jowi> Techno_2: same thing. you don't need the initrd file.
[01:49] <northerntrekker> I was messing with an install and I needed to give myself more permission to the USR directory. so I did sudo chmod 762 to it... and now I'm locked out of everything except the concole window
[01:49] <seif1> devnull: help plz i dont understand
[01:49] <northerntrekker> like the destop is gone
[01:50] <Manika> !tell Manika about dapper
[01:50] <Techno_2> Jowi: Iwas told that you do

[01:51] <mcphail> Manika: wget

[01:51] <kspath> !tell samuel about kubuntu
[01:51] <seif1> devnull: yeah but it has the application places and system, i want just the menu icon and then when i click it it should expand
[01:51] <KenSentMe> !tell northerntrekker about root
[01:51] <Techno_2> Reboot!
[01:51] <devnull> seifl .... do what i just said
[01:52] <ompaul> northerntrekker, this might help
[01:52] <devnull> then remove the extra menus you don't need from your panel by right clicking on them
[01:52] <kspath> KenSentMe: Who sent you?
[01:52] <Manika> mcphail: can it pause downloads? that's all I need
[01:52] <ompaul> northerntrekker, sudo chmod 755 /usr
[01:52] <mcphail> Manika: you can stop and resume later if the server allows
[01:52] <KenSentMe> kspath: the message on the wall did
[01:52] <northerntrekker> it says permission not allowed
[01:52] <Jowi> Techno_2: the initrd file is not needed. to add your kernel do this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14698
[01:52] <ompaul> northerntrekker, get a live cd boot the box mount the drive and do that
[01:53] <northerntrekker> ugh, there is no other way?
[01:53] <northerntrekker> my other machine is a mac and it doesn't think kindly of burning cds, linux, or anything dealing with efficenticy
[01:54] <devnull> hehe
[01:54] <seif1>  devnull ur not understanding my question
[01:54] <IoFran> nos vemos
[01:54] <devnull> an mac's are only the most stable and easy to use desktop operating system at the moment
[01:54] <northerntrekker> I think ubuntu is way better and I've been using a mac for like 8 years
[01:54] <ompaul> northerntrekker, not that I can think of given that you can't execute the commands
[01:55] <devnull> seif1, maybe i am not but what you asked me i just told you .... i was in your position aswell and removed the extra menus from my panel and added a main menu ... the main menu is the Application Menu, Places, and the Settings menu all in one
[01:55] <northerntrekker> what if I drop into the sh shell
[01:55] <northerntrekker> can I log into the root from there?
[01:55] <ompaul> northerntrekker, and here is the down side - if you did that with a -R all bets are off
[01:55] <northerntrekker> oh crap
[01:55] <ompaul> northerntrekker, now your thinking, do this
[01:55] <northerntrekker> I did a sudo would that count?
[01:55] <devnull> seif1, so unless you want to send me a link to a screenshot as i understand it I told you how to do what you wanted
[01:55] <ompaul> northerntrekker, did you do -R ?

[01:56] <northerntrekker> I know I know :(
[01:56] <northerntrekker> all this for real player 10
[01:56] <northerntrekker> and I don't even like real player
[01:56] <devnull> hehe
[01:56] <devnull> if you don't like realplayer there is the helix project
[01:56] <devnull> i believe that is the project that works on real player codec
[01:57] <northerntrekker> well first I need root access before I can think of anything else
[01:57] <Techno_2> Jovi: I'm stuck :(
[01:57] <devnull> seif1, would you like to see a screenshot of my desktop ?
[01:57] <northerntrekker> otherwise I'l be reinstalling to night and crying and drinnking.....
[01:57] <Jowi> Techno_2: I make it easy for you: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14700 (note that 2 reffers to /boot/grub/menu.lst
[01:57] <devnull> northerntrekker, man how many times have we all had those nights :)
[01:57] <ompaul> northerntrekker, so as the machine boots gets to grub press esc and then choose recovery or rescue (can't remember) then >>mount -a <<and chown as I said already >> sudo chmod 755 /usr <<
[01:58] <mcphail> Niah: i think you may have messed up the sudoers file. It _can_ be fixed, but may be easier to reinstall...
[01:58] <ryness> anyone know of a video conferencing / collaboration / whiteboard server/client for *nix? (oss preferred)

[01:58] <Niah> nope, breezy

[01:59] <Niah> I messed up my old ubuntu and had to reinstall
[01:59] <mcphail> mmm. The dapper live-cd install has a few places where things like that can trip you up!
[01:59] <devnull> seif1, if you need more help just messag eme
[01:59] <Jowi> Techno_2: also make sure that both root (hd0,4) and root=/dev/hda5 is correct.
[02:00] <igorzolnikov> i want install XMMS... help me
[02:00] <igorzolnikov> plz
[02:00] <northerntrekker> oh I'm well aware of how to install software, I just let my ego blow up and thought I could shortcut this by giving myself complete access to USR... and my fat fingers hit the wrong numbers
[02:00] <northerntrekker> before I could say oh s*** all my rights were gone
[02:00] <ompaul> igorzolnikov, so click on system administration add programs
[02:01] <Niah> igorzolnikov: xmms should be in the reps... open up your terminal and type sudo apt-get install xmms
[02:01] <igorzolnikov> there gray
[02:01] <digirat> how do you install something through apt with all the recommended and suggested packages?
[02:01] <Techno_2> Jowi: Yes all correct
[02:02] <Techno_2> I've done that, but it can't fidn the swap partition or the root partition when usign the new kernel
[02:02] <igorzolnikov> E: Package xmms has no installation candidate
[02:02] <igorzolnikov> ???
[02:02] <igorzolnikov> What is it?
[02:02] <crimsun> igorzolnikov: enable the main repository.
[02:02] <Jowi> Techno_2: maybe you forgot to compile in support for that into your kernel :)
[02:02] <igorzolnikov> how?
[02:03] <Techno_2> I used menuconfig, am I correct in asuming that it adds everything?
[02:03] <ompaul> igorzolnikov, sudo apt-get install xmms <<< what version of ubuntu are you running?
[02:03] <Jowi> Techno_2: /dev/hda3 = (hd0,2), /dev/hdb3 = (hd1,2)
[02:03] <jvai_> back.. silly coffee shop, bounced me off
[02:03] <igorzolnikov> 5.10
[02:03] <igorzolnikov> i have ubuntu 5.10
[02:03] <ompaul> that command I gave installs it or you have a very broken system
[02:04] <LinuxJones> igorzolnikov, you need to enable the universe repo
[02:04] <ompaul> crimsun, why would main be disabled?
[02:04] <ompaul> LinuxJones, its in mail
[02:04] <ompaul> LinuxJones, its in main
[02:04] <Techno_2> Would hdc5 be hd2, 2?
[02:04] <crimsun> ompaul: no viable network connection during install, or network configuration skipped.
[02:04] <northerntrekker> !tell kensentme about ubuntu
[02:04] <LinuxJones> xmms ?
[02:04] <ompaul> crimsun, thank you
[02:04] <northerntrekker> hey I think it might have worked

[02:30] <xavice> Eh..

[02:30] <ubotu> it has been said that apache is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[02:30] <ShadowShuriken> RandolphCarter, php5 would be good...:)...umm...any thing else like...phpmyadmin or mysql?
[02:30] <xavice> Lol.
[02:30] <xavice> Neato.
[02:30] <simian__> Jowi: which is the recomended way
[02:30] <RandolphCarter> ShadowShuriken: they're all there too :)

[02:31] <Jimbob> what happens when i plug a harddrive that has a windows installation onto a different haddrive controller?
[02:31] <RandolphCarter> ShadowShuriken: you'll need to install the packages for them though - try running 'aptitude' and browsing through the 'net' section
[02:31] <Jimbob> does the drive letter change?
[02:31] <ShadowShuriken> !tell ShadowShuriken about apache
[02:31] <ShadowShuriken> RandolphCarter, okie..
[02:31] <ZeXr0> Jimbob it will change only for the OS you are on it
[02:31] <ompaul> ShadowShuriken, please msg the bot with /msg ubotu KEYWORD and do  >> /msg ubotu lamp << for a good one there :-)
[02:32] <ZeXr0> it will stay the same on the installation once you plugit back
[02:32] <DianWei> Hey pals, my computer keeps freexing when trying to apt-get install&& apt-get upgrade, and gets stuck at setting up wvdial... seeings as how I don't use my dialup modem for nothing, would getting rid of that package save me some terrible grief?
[02:32] <ZeXr0> (Don't know if it clear enought)
[02:32] <Jimbob> zexr0 , but what if  want to stay at that different harddrive controller
[02:32] <ShadowShuriken> ompaul, thx
[02:32] <Jimbob> i wont be able to boot like that would i?
[02:33] <Jowi> DianWei: sudo apt-get remove wvdial
[02:33] <ZeXr0> hum it depents, is the disk stays master ?
[02:33] <ZeXr0> if yeah it should be okay
[02:33] <Jowi> DianWei: no idea if it will fix it though
[02:33] <Jimbob> its a sata
[02:33] <signature16> i have a IBM t30 laptop and i dont know how to use the built in number pad.  anybody know how?
[02:33] <ZeXr0> oh
[02:33] <Jimbob> is there master in sata?
[02:33] <ZeXr0> then I don,t know
[02:33] <CokeNCode> no\
[02:33] <Jimbob> =(
[02:33] <ZeXr0> I didn't know about sata
[02:33] <ZeXr0> but if you give me one second
[02:33] <DianWei> It tells me to do this, which will lead to configuring wvdial, and freez again. "dpkg --configure -a"
[02:34] <ompaul> signature16, check the blue buttons and the numlock key :-)
[02:34] <Jowi> signature16: normally you hold the "fn" key down i think and make sure that num lock is enabled
[02:34] <myname> hello
[02:34] <xavice> Hello.
[02:34] <myname> how to protect my ssh ? i mean only allow people from some ip not for all ip
[02:34] <DianWei> I have found somewhat of a run around wit synaptic though...
[02:34] <ShadowShuriken> ompaul, where would be a good place to start learning perl/python...and which is easier?
[02:34] <ZeXr0> I'll see if I can have some info about sata
[02:34] <signature16> jowi:  it numberpad doesnt work with the blue fn key
[02:34] <xavice> Did you try "man ssh?" Maybe it will hint you on something/
[02:35] <kspath> myname: tcp wrappers / firestarter?
[02:35] <ompaul> ShadowShuriken, a loaded question, i think python is, and there is a book with ubuntu called "dive into python"
[02:35] <kspath> myname: fail2ban
[02:35] <Jimbob> this is exactly what i did, i was trying to install ubuntu, but found out it doesnt support my sataII controller, so i plug my harddrive that was on sataII to a sataI controller then installed ubuntu on a different partition. now when i try to boot windows, i have to plug it back into the sataIi controller otherwise it wont boot
[02:35] <myname> kspath : dont understand what u mean
[02:35] <Jowi> myname: in /etc/hosts.allow: sshd: 96.48.15. (would make any host on the 96.48.15 network able to log in)
[02:35] <DianWei> It says it will remove ubuntu-desktop, am I in peril?
[02:35] <ShadowShuriken> ompaul, if i put in dive into python...it should work?
[02:35] <myname> ?
[02:35] <kspath> myname: hosts.allow hosts.deny   and apt-cache search firestarter and apt-cache search fail2ban
[02:35] <myname> did i need to edit config ?
[02:35] <Smirnoff> Can anyone offer assistance in tackleling drivers for a couple of unknown drivers in device manager?
[02:36] <myname> i c
[02:36] <myname> ty ty
[02:36] <Jowi> signature16: then i do not know. it works on my wifes laptop like that
[02:36] <kspath> myname: You need to study/learn/read about tcp wrappers and other things.
[02:36] <Jimbob> so does anyone know what i can do to make windows bootable on my sata1 controller?
[02:37] <ompaul> ShadowShuriken, you can read it, after that it is up to you, >sudo apt-get install diveintopython< should work
[02:37] <xavice> !perl
[02:37] <ubotu> xavice: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[02:37] <xavice> :\
[02:37] <DianWei> My understanding is that ubuntu-desktop is just a package that depends on a lot of other packages so it is an intelligent way to get a lot of important software easily but it is safely removed later if one doesn't want everything. Am I correct?
[02:37] <ShadowShuriken> ompaul, aptitude isnt able to install php4-mysql and phpmyadmin :S
[02:37] <DianWei> Everything else it depended on should still update fine, correct?
[02:37] <Jowi> DianWei: correct
[02:38] <ompaul> DianWei, the first part yes, the second part no, and thus the assumption is wrong ;-)
[02:38] <Jimbob> anyone?
[02:38] <disinterested_pe> is theres any players that will play wma formats?
[02:38] <ZeXr0> Jimbob sorry I didn't find anything about changing the disk on a sata controller :S
[02:38] <corey> anyone direct me on how to set the default video/audio player?
[02:38] <xavice> Uh..
[02:38] <Jowi> DianWei: appart from if you do a dist-upgrade
[02:38] <xavice> MPlayer
[02:38] <ompaul> DianWei, my error sorry
[02:38] <Jimbob> its ok zerxr0
[02:38] <xavice> disinterested_pe: MPlayer
[02:38] <crimsun> disinterested_pe: possibly mplayer.
[02:38] <ompaul> DianWei, that is the only thing it may cause you problems with
[02:38] <xavice> disinterested_pe: $ sudo apt-get install mplayer
[02:38] <Jimbob> do you have experience messing around with boot.ini zexr0?
[02:38] <disinterested_pe> do u know what plug in option does?
[02:38] <Abo> any one knows of a nice GUI FTP client?
[02:39] <DianWei> Ok, cool it didn't lock up in this update. I am running the beta by the way so I don't think I'll need to run dist-upgrade. :3
[02:39] <ompaul> !tell ShadowShuriken about universe
[02:39] <Jowi> DianWei: if you ever want to do a dist-upgrade it is good to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package
[02:39] <xavice> disint. : I don't understand you.
[02:39] <disinterested_pe> ok never mind
[02:39] <ompaul> ShadowShuriken, you can then search for all applications in Synaptic and life will be fun
[02:39] <DianWei> I'll probably need to though 6 months from now give or take?
[02:39] <xavice> !tell xavice about universe
[02:40] <xavice> Lol.
[02:40] <DianWei> Well, in any case, Thanks guys. Have a good 'un.
[02:40] <ompaul> DianWei, if you leave in it until Next thursday you can install dapper and leave it out for 3 years ;-
[02:40] <Abo> !tell Abo about universe
[02:40] <ompaul> DianWei, ;-)
[02:40] <xavice> !tell Abo about universe
[02:40] <lime4by4> using the command line how do u create a user and password for mysql?

[02:40] <andrejkw> I can't get my sound working with Doom 3 for some reason. Can anyone help me?
[02:41] <Abo> Jowi, thnx I'll try it right away
[02:41] <xavice> Lol
[02:41] <ompaul> Abo ^^^^^ up a few lines xavice the same there look up the screen
[02:41] <xavice> I can hardly play UT2005 on ubuntu
[02:41] <icefeldt> hey
[02:41] <andrejkw> xavice: UT2004 maybe?
[02:41] <xavice> Er.
[02:41] <icefeldt> have a small problem here
[02:41] <xavice> Er.
[02:41] <xavice> 2004
[02:41] <xavice> Yea.
[02:41] <Jowi> lol
[02:42] <andrejkw> lol
[02:42] <xavice> lol
[02:42] <andrejkw> I can't get my sound working with Doom 3 for some reason. Can anyone help me?
[02:42] <ompaul> !enter
[02:42] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[02:42] <xavice> Did you install ALSA drivers?
[02:42] <andrejkw> Yes...
[02:42] <icefeldt> i installed a programm (cpuspeedy) with "make install". now i want do remove it. But how? (installed linux today)
[02:42] <xavice> Hm.
[02:42] <xavice> Sound drivers perhaps?
[02:43] <andrejkw> icefeldt: next time use "sudo checkinstall"
[02:43] <icefeldt> ? why? what does that command do?
[02:43] <andrejkw> icefeldt: creates a nice package for you and installs it, so later on you can remove it using package manager.
[02:43] <Jowi> icefeldt: i agree with andrejkw . checkinstall is great
[02:43] <icefeldt> oksx
[02:43] <Abo> is there any tool similar to "Google Desktop" for ubuntu?
[02:43] <icefeldt> okay
[02:43] <Jowi> !checkinstall
[02:43] <ubotu> somebody said checkinstall was http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CheckInstall
[02:43] <icefeldt> now i know
[02:43] <icefeldt> but what shall i do now?
[02:43] <LinuxJones> andrejkw, try killall esd then start doom3
[02:44] <ompaul> icefeldt,  do it by hand :-(
[02:44] <dli> icefeldt, hopefully, you can "make uninstall"
[02:44] <Jowi> icefeldt: remove by hand.
[02:44] <andrejkw> icefeldr: if you still have it unpacked and compiled u can still run checkinstall in the directory have it overwite all your files and then simply remove it.
[02:44] <ompaul> andrejkw, nice one
[02:44] <xavice> Does anyone know of any fun free and native Linux games?
[02:44] <Jowi> nice save andrejkw
[02:44] <RandolphCarter> xavice: neverball :)
[02:44] <andrejkw> still no sound in doom3 :'(
[02:44] <dli> xavice, fun and free, or "fun free"?
[02:44] <andrejkw> This is driving me nuts, I tried everything.
[02:44] <hcatlin> Is there a nice way to replicate packages onto a new system?
[02:45] <xavice> fun AND free
[02:45] <xavice> Eh
[02:45] <Healot> xavice: a lot, what type of game?
[02:45] <ompaul> xavice, read the message from the bot then search for games
[02:45] <xavice> I'd prefer RPGish
[02:45] <hcatlin> Like, I don't need data mirrored, just packages.
[02:45] <xavice> !gamess
[02:45] <ubotu> xavice: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[02:45] <xavice> !games
[02:45] <ubotu> somebody said games was http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=5153 or http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php and http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Loki_Installers_for_Linux_Gamers  News http://www.linux-gamers.net/
[02:45] <RandolphCarter> xavice: there's _always_ nethack
[02:45] <xavice> Yea..
[02:45] <dli> hcatlin, do you want to copy an installation to another machine?
[02:45] <xavice> But.
[02:45] <icefeldt> make uninstall doesnt work
[02:45] <xavice> I got bored of that.
[02:45] <george_> does anyone know of a player to play .wmv files?
[02:45] <icefeldt> teher comes an error message
[02:45] <xavice> george_: Mplayer
[02:45] <RandolphCarter> hmm :( if only ADOM was free.. :/
[02:45] <dli> icefeldt, follow the checkinstall way
[02:45] <hcatlin> dli: Basically. I have a production environment setup with like 200 packages that need to be installed beyond the base installation.
[02:45] <xavice> george_: sudo apt-get install mplayer
[02:46] <RandolphCarter> xavice: you could install scummvm and beneath-a-steel-sky, best point and click I ever played
[02:46] <Jowi> xavice: glob2 is a very different and nice realtime strategy game
[02:46] <hcatlin> dli: So, I just want to be able to have a script to automate taking those 200 and installing them on any new computer.
[02:46] <ompaul> xavice, you need to stop hitting enter after ever one word entry onscreen when your replying to people, thanks
[02:46] <andrejkw> So... anyone has a solution to my Doom 3 dillema?
[02:46] <george_> thanx xavice
[02:46] <xavice> ompaul: Thanks, but I've already enabled universe and multiverse
[02:46] <xavice> lol
[02:46] <Duriel> hi
[02:46] <LinuxJones> andrejkw, killall esd didn't work ?
[02:46] <RandolphCarter> andrejkw: Doom 3 requires OSS in the kernel
[02:47] <RandolphCarter> if there's isn't an OSS driver, or you're not running ALSA OOS compataiblity, you're OOL
[02:47] <andrejkw> Man, this is nuts, I am beginning to hate Gnome. I never had problems like this with KDE.
[02:47] <ompaul> xavice, please don't hit enter after a one word line, and in a terminal you can type apt-cache search game | less and read them all :-)
[02:47] <andrejkw> I am running everything, I forced the game to use OSS, still no sound.
[02:47] <dli> hcatlin, I think you can "cp -a" for a few boxes, however, if you want really automatic installation, you may read more about the FAI project for debian
[02:47] <th1> andrejkw, gnome is a bit weird :)
[02:47] <andrejkw> I have AOSS working correctly with other programs.
[02:47] <th1> I would stick with KDE if I was you :)
[02:48] <RandolphCarter> hmm :/ if you've got that, I'm not sure then, I doubt Gnome could cause this though
[02:48] <Jowi> andrejkw: just a thing... are you running esd? you can try to kill it
[02:48] <xavice> I'm sorry for hitting enter. It's a habit. And thainks.
[02:48] <hcatlin> dli: Thanks, I'll check it out.
[02:48] <ompaul> np
[02:48] <andrejkw> thl: KDE seems a bit sluggish and how would I say this... packed with way too many features, without absolutely any balance.
[02:48] <andrejkw> Jowi: nope, did killall esd
=== Duriel is now known as Duriel`Keifling
[02:48] <ompaul> andrejkw, said like j dub
[02:49] <andrejkw> omplaul: huh?
[02:49] <Jowi> andrejkw: and did you set up alsa (or oss) as your output sink?
[02:49] <xavice> I agree with adrejkw, KDE comes with TOO much stuff. For example I used to have 3-5 PDF viewers.
[02:49] <icefeldt> guys? whats the command fo deleting a file?
[02:49] <ompaul> andrejkw, your not the only one to not go for kde in particular ;-) that is all
[02:49] <xavice> ice: rm
[02:49] <icefeldt> kk thx
[02:49] <andrejkw> Jowi: ok, now you're getting a bit technical, umm, sink? You mean the one I wash my hands in?
[02:49] <xavice> ice: e.g. rm ogmomogomgomgvirus.sh
[02:50] <Jowi> !tell icefeldt about commands
[02:50] <cyphase> is there a .deb for Truecrypt on Dapper?
[02:50] <Abo> I want to install yahoo messenger, I downloaded the .deb file, and did dpkg -i ymes.., but it fails saying it depends on other library, is there a way I can get apt-get to go download and install all needed libraries without failing?
[02:50] <xavice> Can anyone tell me what's so great about Dapper? Features ect.
[02:50] <Jowi> andrejkw: i think the settings are in System -> preferences -> multimedia something (not using gnome here)
[02:51] <igorzolnikov> what is App Launcher?
[02:51] <andrejkw> Jowi: pipeline is esdsink
[02:51] <xavice> The name is self explanitory.
[02:51] <cyphase> Abo, is there any reason you want Yahoo Messenger instead of Gaim?
[02:51] <xavice> It's something at launchs an application
[02:51] <igorzolnikov> How i can start CPU/Mem monitor
[02:51] <igorzolnikov> ?
[02:51] <biovore> xavice: uses more moemory, looks cooler, has a nicer multimedia backend..
[02:51] <LinuxJones> xavice, alot snappier on the desktop for 1 :)
[02:51] <Jowi> andrejkw: maybe you should change it to alsa or oss or whatever you use now that you have killed esd
[02:51] <Abo> cyphase, I didn't manage to make the sound work on gaim (I didn't search much about that)
[02:52] <Smirnoff> Can anyone offer assistance in how I get to "root" in terminal?
[02:52] <xavice> Wait wait wait... MORE memory?
[02:52] <cyphase> Abo, what sound?
[02:52] <cyphase> Abo, you mean like audio chat?
[02:52] <Abo> cyphase, audio chat
[02:52] <ompaul> !root

[02:52] <nickgarvey> wireless on ubuntu, the bane of my existance...
[02:52] <cyphase> Abo, Gaim doesn't support it yet, but the linux version of yahoo messenger doesn't support it well
[02:52] <Abo> cyphase, and in msn messger there are many features missing in gaim, (or that I coulnt' find)
[02:52] <biovore> for gnome ubunut yes..
[02:52] <xavice> Okay.
[02:53] <xavice> I'll stick with Breezy for know.
[02:53] <xavice> Agh, typos. now*
[02:53] <Abo> cyphase, ok, is there a way I can issue the apt-get command to fetch the missing dependancies without failing?
[02:53] <biovore> dapper is great on newer systems with cpu and memory resources
[02:53] <cyphase> Abo, are you in breezy or dapper?
[02:53] <rab> can someone help me unserstand why when i restart my server, i cant ssh into it until i manually login onit
[02:54] <Abo> cyphase, 5.10 (that is breezy, right?)
[02:54] <icefeldt> guys`?
[02:54] <andrejkw> Jowi: Tried ALSA and OSS, none work.
[02:54] <cyphase> yea
[02:54] <cyphase> rab, are you using network manager?
[02:54] <rab> nvm
[02:54] <andrejkw> I think I'll just jump off of a cliff.
[02:54] <rab> sorry
[02:54] <rab> i was being unpatient
[02:54] <igorzolnikov> How i can start CPU/Mem monitor?
[02:54] <icefeldt> i installed checkinstall. how to use it in the future? (for uninstallation)
[02:54] <Jowi> andrejkw: then i have no clue. that should have done it for most programs
[02:54] <biovore> igorzolnikov: there are a bunch of those..  I use gkrellm
[02:55] <cyphase> Abo, i don't know what the dependencies are, and i don't know if you can apt-get them
[02:55] <cyphase> sorry
[02:55] <Jowi> icefeldt: instead of typing "sudo make install" you type "sudo checkinstall"
[02:55] <andrejkw> icefeldt: "sudo checkinstall" right after make, and then to remove search for the package in synaptic and remove it.
[02:55] <dli> icefeldt, run " sudo checkinstall ", instead of " sudo make install "
[02:55] <Smirnoff> Hey ompaul, !root came up with command not found
[02:55] <cyphase> i haven't used it
[02:55] <biovore> try a apt-get install -f
[02:55] <daryl_> Anyone know a good macro program for Linux, to repeat mouse clicks?
[02:55] <Abo> cyphase, ok, thank for trying to help :)
[02:55] <ompaul> Smirnoff, I will have the bot send you a message it was in the channel
[02:55] <icefeldt> andrejkw:  thx. i didnt know that it goes into synaptics
[02:56] <Jowi> andrejkw: i need some sleep. hope it will sort itself out for you
[02:56] <theine> dli: could one actually do "fakeroot checkinstall" as well?
=== bigkevmcbobbyd is now known as bobbyd
[02:57] <andrejkw> Jowi: alright, night.
[02:57] <nickgarvey> could someone help me understand what the following 2 line error message means?
[02:57] <theine> daryl_: what do you want to achieve?

[02:58] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: A missing firmware for w/e.
[02:58] <daryl_> theine: just trying to make my mouse do about 1500 mouse clicks for me.  to save my hand...
[02:58] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: are you trying to load a module for a wireless card or something?
[02:58] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: yessir, ndiswrapper
[02:58] <nickgarvey> works fine on suse 10
[02:58] <daryl_> theine: i move my mouse to the bottom right of the window, pess a button, move the mouse to the top right press a button. i do that about 1500 moe times, and i'm done
[02:59] <theine> daryl_: just curious, why do you need to do this?
[02:59] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: what card?
[02:59] <theine> daryl_: note: I don't know of any macro programs
[02:59] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: lemme give you my lspci
[02:59] <dli> andrejkw, nickgarvey mentioned bcm43
[02:59] <xavice> !zsh
[02:59] <ubotu> I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, xavice
[02:59] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: 0000:03:02.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g]  802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02)
[03:00] <daryl_> theine: I added about 1200 categories to my site accidently, instead of making them sub-categories.  the method for removal is to remove them one at a time.
[03:00] <xavice> Ouch man. What site?
[03:00] <Nigh7fox> hey
[03:00] <igorzolnikov>  How i can start CPU/Mem monitor?
[03:01] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: is it external?
[03:01] <daryl_> theine: ezmacros works great in windows. i'm thinking of just downloading it, and running it thorugh wine
[03:01] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: nope, internal
[03:01] <theine> daryl_: what are those categories you're talking about?
[03:01] <nickgarvey> make uninstall when I was getting ndiswrapper gave me some problems
[03:01] <nickgarvey> I believe thats the issue
[03:01] <dli> igorzolnikov, right click on the gnome panel, "Add to Panel", and select applets
[03:01] <icefeldt> guys now i want to use checkinstall but it gives me an error
[03:01] <nickgarvey> I'm on a live cd, not going to install if it doesn't work
[03:01] <daryl_> theine product categories, in a store on a website.
[03:02] <icefeldt> it says: no rule to create checkinstall
[03:02] <theine> daryl_: can't you just edit a file?
[03:02] <dli> icefeldt, it's "sudo checkinstall", not " sudo make checkinstall"
[03:02] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: you need to pusha  firmware to it.
[03:02] <icefeldt> ah ok
[03:02] <daryl_> theine: i have direct access to the SQL database, but i'm not sure if it would damage dependancies by removing the categories.  and would rather not risk it.
[03:02] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: otherwise it won't work.
[03:03] <ShadowShuriken> !tell ShadowShuriken about Dapper
[03:03] <theine> daryl_: ah, i see
[03:03] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: how might I do that?  I haven't had to do that with any other distros so I am not sure what I'm doing ;)
[03:03] <mlalkaka> how can i determine what ports are being used by a certain program?
[03:03] <dli> nickgarvey, the firmwares are under /lib/firmware/ , cp to your hard drive ( same folder there)
[03:03] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: but, I can't stand yast anymore heh
[03:03] <mlalkaka> or what ports are being used overall?
[03:03] <ompaul> !tell ShadowShuriken about msgthebot
[03:03] <nickgarvey> dli: what do you mean?
[03:03] <theine> daryl_: so you're using some kind of graphical front-end to access the SQL database?
[03:03] <daryl_> theine: yes
[03:03] <xavice> How do I find out which process is assigned to what 'number?' For instance, I want to find out the 'number' for XChat to run a kill # command.
[03:04] <dli> nickgarvey, if you know your hdd partition for / , mount it, and cp the firmwares
[03:04] <andrejkw> nickgarvey: what is your computer brand and model?
[03:04] <nickgarvey> dli: like would the firmware be on my old suse 10.1 install?
[03:04] <tonyyarusso> xavice: pidof xchat or ps aux | grep xchat
[03:04] <nickgarvey> andrejkw: HP Pavilion zv6000
[03:04] <nickgarvey> dli: I see, I'll grab that if ndiswrapper doesn't do it for me ;)
[03:04] <theine> daryl_: which one?
[03:04] <dli> xavice, you maybe try, " pkill -9 xchat "
[03:04] <daryl_> theine: custom interface
[03:05] <xavice> Okay..
[03:05] <xavice> That worked, but what's the -9 argument for?
[03:05] <dli> xavice, " man kill "
[03:05] <andrejkw> nickgarvay: let's talk using PM, too cluttered in here.
[03:07] <daryl_> only 1300 mouseclicks to go... joy.. i'm gone.. see yah folks

[03:11] <achandra> hello. is there an imbedded movie player for firefox that works well? I used to use mplayer in suse but dont know what it is with ubuntu .
[03:11] <theine> tonyyarusso: i guess he has not been introduced to the joys of unix shells...
[03:11] <CokeNCode>  Couldn't stat source package list http://theli.free.fr ./ Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/theli.free.fr_packages_breezy_._Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)

[03:12] <CokeNCode> could someone help me with that error above
[03:13] <tonyyarusso> HIHello: I'm not sure if there's an easy way, but you can look into modifying your xorg.conf...
[03:13] <HIHello> Hmmm how would I do this??
[03:13] <anan_uk> hi all, how can i format my ubuntu 5.10 and all my hard drive to install the new ubuntu 6.06RC version for testing ?
[03:14] <biovore> anan_uk: just install using the 6.06 cd
[03:14] <anan_uk> it detected as non-bootable CD :(
[03:15] <tonyyarusso> HIHello: Manually tweaking a text configuration file.  (I hate to say it but I recommend this be a look-around-and-read moment, b/c you'll get more out of it that way.)  In short, you'll be finding the mouse section, then the line for that button, and describing the behaviour it should have.
[03:15] <tonyyarusso> Do we have an xorg.conf page on the wiki I wonder?
[03:15] <HIHello> OK,I saw something about this,thanks I will check it out!
[03:15] <HIHello> Thank you Tony
[03:15] <tonyyarusso> Good luck.
[03:16] <Shadyman> anan_uk: Did you use a program to burn the image of the cd, as opposed to burning the image file TO the Cd?
[03:16] <igorzolnikov> what cpu/mem monitor is best?
[03:17] <anan_uk> yes, i used GnomeBaker to burn the iso file
[03:17] <Shadyman> anan_uk: Weird.
[03:17] <anan_uk> i burned the alternative iso install one
[03:18] <Kakurady> I cannot install ATI propertiary video driver, can anyone help?
[03:18] <Slayer> Hi
[03:18] <Shadyman> Kakurady: Install xserver-xorg-driver-ati ?
[03:18] <Slayer> why when Ubuntu is loadin
[03:18] <Kakurady> What's that?
[03:18] <Shadyman> Kakurady: The ATI driver.
[03:19] <Slayer> it takes so  much time in Configuring Network interfaces?
[03:19] <Slayer> i saw this in various computers
[03:19] <Shadyman> Slayer: Are you on a laptop?
[03:19] <Slayer> yeah
[03:19] <Shadyman> Slayer: And not plugged into a network cable?
[03:19] <Slayer> is plugged
[03:19] <zelevw> my tv out works but i cant change my resolution to anything other than 1024*768...i added 800x600 to xorg.conf, restart but i still dont have the option to change...centrino-based laptop...i810 video chips
[03:19] <Kakurady> Shadyman: Can it be used for the X1k series?
[03:19] <Slayer> i saw this being plugged
[03:20] <Slayer> in HP laptop and IBM laptop
[03:20] <Shadyman> Slayer: Strange.
[03:20] <Slayer> yeah
[03:20] <Slayer> solution?
[03:20] <Slayer> i saw in 2 compuetrs in diferent networks
[03:20] <Shadyman> Slayer: I know that's a problem if wire isn't plugged in because it tries to auto discover network connections via wirieless
[03:20] <Slayer> ok
[03:20] <icefeldt> hey guys how can i "add a link to the application menu?" dont want to type "sudo gtk-cpuspeedy" every time
[03:21] <Shadyman> Slayer: And at boot, if wireless isn't configured, it doesn't work, so it waits for DHCP to time out
[03:21] <Slayer> i think it takes time to get DHCP
[03:21] <james_xxx> can someone tell me how i can view all of the hardware that ubuntu is recognizing?
[03:21] <Shadyman> Slayer: I think there's a setting in /(something)/DHCP3/something.conf
[03:21] <davebad> Hello everyone.
[03:21] <Slayer> humm
[03:21] <Slayer> i got it
[03:21] <Shadyman> james: Go to System > Administration > Hardware
[03:21] <Shadyman> james: Something about hardware
[03:21] <james_xxx> i am using KDE
[03:22] <davebad> has anyone used Xdmx?
[03:22] <Slayer> both computers have wireles and RJ45
[03:22] <Shadyman> james_xxx: Oh, then I have no idea
[03:22] <Shadyman> Slayer: It's been suggested before to lower the DHCP3 timeout time.
[03:22] <tonyyarusso> icefeldt: Right-click the little Ubuntu icon, "Edit menu", and go to town.
[03:22] <Shadyman> Slayer: But every time someone complains about it taking too long, some people complain it takes too short because some networks don't resolve
[03:22] <james_xxx> does anyone know how to view one's hardware using kubuntu?
[03:22] <achandra> what is good embedded moivie player for firefox in ubuntu ?
[03:23] <Shadyman> Slayer: I think there's a specification listed on launchpad.net somewhere for it, either there or the wiki
[03:23] <Shadyman> Slayer: Maybe it'd help if you added your comments :)
[03:23] <andrejkw> achandra: totem-xine

[03:24] <icefeldt> tonyyarusso: thx mate
[03:24] <tonyyarusso> Kakurady: Have you read the wiki instructions for that?
[03:25] <Shadyman> !fglrx
[03:25] <ubotu> rumour has it, fglrx is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:25] <Kakurady> Tried. Fakeroot didn't work.
[03:25] <davebad> achandra: just install it using synaptic
[03:25] <phenom> Hello, I am having trouble getting Warcraft 3 to connect to Battle.net in Ubuntu :)

[03:26] <Kakurady> ...Warcraft 3?!
[03:26] <phenom> Using Wine
[03:26] <Shadyman> Kakurady: Yes, he said WC3.
[03:26] <tonyyarusso> Kakurady: Do you have build-essential?  Not sure if you need that...  (just saw make failed)
[03:26] <davebad> achandra: if you do a "sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer"
[03:26] <Shadyman> tonyyarusso: Good call
[03:26] <phenom> Can I get some help please?
[03:26] <Shadyman> phenom: Just ask
[03:27] <Shadyman> phenom: Oh, you did. Silly me.
[03:27] <phenom> How do I get Warcraft 3 to connect to the internet using Wine?
[03:27] <Kakurady> Aww, I forgot to download it.
[03:27] <tonyyarusso> phenom: (Preferably with specifics and a pastebin if necessary - do you have more info?)
[03:27] <Shadyman> phenom: I'm not sure how many people here have used wc3 and battlenet, you
[03:27] <Shadyman> phenom: You'd have to see if anyone responds

[03:28] <hosler> james_xxx: i would suggest using google to find which driver it needs.
[03:29] <Slayer> ready
[03:29] <Slayer> it was the wifi
[03:29] <james_xxx> hosler, one problem i have is that i do not know which version of the product i have
[03:29] <achandra> davebad: even adding all the source possibilities into apt no mplayer-mozilla...for dapper
[03:29] <agorf> hello! anyone can explain why with mrxvt i have this http://img210.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mrxvt1xb.png and with gnome-terminal i have this: http://img210.imageshack.us/my.php?image=gnometerminal4ok.png while using the same font and size?
[03:29] <hosler> james_xxx, shouldnt really matter. At least i wouldnt think so.
[03:29] <Slayer> what is the command use in ubuntun same ipconfig in windows
[03:29] <Slayer> ifconfig?
[03:29] <Xenguy> yes
[03:29] <hyphenated> james_xxx: open a shell, plug it in and type in 'dmesg | tail'
[03:30] <hosler> james_xxx: what does lspci bring up for the card?
[03:30] <hyphenated> james_xxx: then paste the result of that in a pastebin
[03:30] <james_xxx> hosler, it matters, because different version apparently have different chipsets

[03:41] <webhed> Hey all. Couple of questions. First, does anyone know if the scsi issue that was present in earlier betas of Dapper has been addressed in the RC that is available now, and second, does anyone know if I can just create fat partition on an iPod using gparted? I have a ton of junk files on my iPod I can't delete for some reason and thought I'd just format it and start over.
[03:41] <andrejkw> namaku: iptables
[03:41] <hyphenated> james_xxx: yeah, it doesn't know what driver to use. can you pastebin the output of 'lsusb' ?
[03:42] <Madpilot> achandra, are you in a server install? No GUI?

[03:43] <james_xxx> hyphenated, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14706
[03:43] <noiesmo> achandra, or you can add the debian repo but as gnomefreak said earlier it might break your system didnt break mine though

[03:45] <gnomefreak> ^^^ whats that than?
[03:45] <Madpilot> namaku, are you running a web server on your computer?
[03:45] <hyphenated> james_xxx: it looks like you're going to need ndiswrapper to make these work
[03:45] <noiesmo> gnomefreak, you help him then dont leave him hanging
[03:45] <gnomefreak> i told him how to get mplayer
[03:45] <noiesmo> gnomefreak, i said also or you can add the debian repo but as gnomefreak said earlier it might break your system didnt break mine though
[03:46] <nickgarvey> no friendly fire please ;)
[03:46] <webhed> let me guess... I'm invisible and don't know how to turn it off lol
[03:46] <gnomefreak> and than after you said that you typed what i pasted
[03:46] <james_xxx> hyphenated, hmmm..... according to a forum , version 4 of the wusb54g is supported... but i do not know what version i have
[03:46] <gnomefreak> achandra: enable universe and multiverse repos please
[03:46] <namaku> :(
[03:46] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell achandra about mplayer
[03:47] <Madpilot> webhed, nope, you're visible - but evidently nobody has answers for you right now...
[03:47] <Madpilot> webhed, also, asking just one question at a time might get better results - and the Dapper channel is #ubuntu+1 for questions/problems w/ Dapper
[03:47] <webhed> ok just wanted to make sure. This is my first time using Xchat.
[03:47] <webhed> Thanks for the tips guys.
[03:48] <nickgarvey> webhed: assuming an ipod is treated like a usb drive, then I am pretty sure you could format it with gparted, I see no reason why no
[03:50] <nickgarvey> namaku: perhaps your hosts.allow/deny files
[03:50] <webhed> ok I'll restrict this channel to the ipod question and the other question is now in the ubuntu+1 chan.
[03:50] <namaku> ?
[03:50] <namaku> how
[03:50] <nickgarvey> namaku: although thats a guess, I have never wanted to do that
[03:50] <hyphenated> james_xxx: you have one v2 and one v4 it seems
[03:50] <webhed> Does anyone else know if its ok to just format the iPod?
[03:50] <Madpilot> namaku, I don't think you answered my earlier question: are you running a web server? If not, why worry?
[03:50] <roast> nickgarvey: is Lan on one interface and the outside on another?
[03:50] <nickgarvey> namaku: man hosts.allow
[03:51] <gnomefreak> webhed: its fine
[03:51] <james_xxx> hyphenated, EXCELLENT... then there should be native support for the v.4
[03:51] <nickgarvey> roast: I don't see how you wolud do that, I assume they have a router or such
[03:51] <gnomefreak> as for your other question i think it was fixed
[03:51] <webhed> I read that there are two partitions, a small 30mb one or so for disk info etc and the bigger 20gb drive is ok to format
[03:51] <hyphenated> james_xxx: is that the one you unplugged and plugged back in? :-)
[03:51] <james_xxx> hyphenated, yes
[03:51] <roast> nickgarvey: oh okay. so it's one interface that can have incoming from local and outside?
[03:51] <webhed> gnomefreak, do you know where I could find out for sure it it was fixed before I start installing?
[03:51] <namaku> ok
[03:51] <gnomefreak> webhed: that would need to go to #ipod or #ubuntu-offtopic
[03:52] <gnomefreak> webhed: did you file a bug on it?
[03:52] <webhed> I didn't file a bug but someone on the ubuntu forums told me it was a known issue, after I experienced it the hard way.
[03:52] <hyphenated> james_xxx: http://www.qbik.ch/usb/devices/showdev.php?id=3695
[03:53] <gnomefreak> webhed: 1st you find a bug file it and if it was known its fixed
[03:53] <gnomefreak> or will be before the 1st

[03:53] <sopido> hi.. i'm on kubuntu dapper and i installed beagle, but when i run beagle-settings i get "Unhandled Exception: System.DllNotFoundException: intl" any ideas how to fix this?

[03:54] <gnomefreak> ^^ i suggest looking there for it it if it was known its there
[03:54] <webhed> checking now, thanks
[03:55] <gnomefreak> sopido: try in #kubuntu or #ubuntu+1

[03:56] <james_xxx> hyph, well, supposedly some have been able to get this card to work
[03:56] <hyphenated> it might have native support in dapper, but I have no idea on that one
[03:56] <james_xxx> hyphenated, another question.... is there a usb wireless adapter (g-band) that works well with ubuntu/kubuntu?
[03:57] <james_xxx> hyphenated, or a g-band card?
[03:57] <hyphenated> no idea, james_xxx. my laptop came with an intel-based one
[03:58] <james_xxx> hyphenated, the reason i purchased this card is because i found it on a list of cards that are supposed to be ubuntu compatible without ndiswrapper
[03:58] <Pyru> james_xxx, then on a new installation it should detect it and work when you activate it in network settings?
[03:58] <hyphenated> james_xxx: here's something to try.. go to #ubuntu+1 and ask someone in there to run 'grep 13b1 /lib/$(uname -r)/modules.usbmap' and pastebin the results for you :-)
[03:58] <issaker> why is the owner of my harddrives "root" and not me?
[03:59] <james_xxx> Pyru, and if i did not have the card when kubuntu was installed?
[03:59] <hyphenated> oops, that should have been /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.usbmap :-)

[04:03] <Madpilot> aside from that, I'm not sure I can help - my sound has always 'just worked' in Ubuntu...
[04:04] <james_xxx> man, if i only knew of a decent g-band wireless card or usb adapter that would work with ubuntu, i would buy the damned thing...... i just have no idea what to buy
[04:05] <sehzade> www.blogcu.com/s3hzad3
[04:05] <maxkelley> yeah, no sound cards are detected.
[04:05] <issaker> madpilot, so can i log in as root?
[04:05] <webhed> Looks like the scsi issue is fixed for some and not for others. Bummer.
[04:05] <Madpilot> issaker, not by default - why would you want to?
[04:05] <Madpilot> issaker, if you need admin privs, use sudo
[04:05] <webhed> Also, I tried to use gparted to create the partition but it didn't do anything.
[04:05] <achandra> thanks...got it working
[04:05] <T`> anyone here uses bcm43xx based wifi card in their laptop?

[04:06] <issaker> how do i use sudo
[04:06] <biovore> james_xxx: you probably not going to find any g cards that work nativly under linux because they all need a close source filmware to be loaded on the chipset to get them to work.
[04:06] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell issaker about sudo
[04:06] <T`> it says OpenMAC connected, but dont think i can send any packets
[04:06] <achandra> gnomefreak: thanks
[04:06] <webhed> Does anyone know what channel would be best for ipod questions under ubuntu os? Here or somewhere else?
[04:06] <biovore> same with 802.11n cards..  probably won't have any linux support natvily
[04:06] <achandra> noiesmo: thanks
[04:06] <biovore> webhed: aramok work greast with ipod I hear
[04:06] <noiesmo> achandra, np
[04:07] <Schalken> doesnt amarok require the kde libraries?
[04:07] <noiesmo> yes its a kde ap
[04:07] <Pyru> achandra came back to save me
[04:07] <Pyru> lol
[04:07] <noiesmo> ap app
[04:08] <foxgamer> Hi all. I was just wondering whether or not it was possible to do like a dist-upgrade to the 64bit from 32bit?
[04:08] <Schalken> does that make it look about as out-of-place as a gnome app in kde?
[04:08] <dli> foxgamer, no way
[04:08] <james_xxx> biovore, do  you think that could ever change?
[04:08] <foxgamer> So a total format/re-install then?
[04:09] <HellDragon`> i feel like a mug.
[04:09] <webhed> its amarok and it doesn't seem to work as well as gtkpod for me at least.
[04:09] <dli> foxgamer, that's the easiest, if you don't have to be worried about data on disk
[04:09] <james_xxx> biovore, or are linux users permanently stuck with slow wireless?
[04:09] <Madpilot> Schalken, you can tweak KDE apps so they don't look totally out of place in gnome
[04:09] <foxgamer> dli, That's why I was hoping for a dist-upgrade option. I have a lot of stuff I need to keep.
[04:09] <webhed> Does anyone know how to delete undeletable files? Its not permissions, it says the filesystem is mounted readonly but I mounted it rw
[04:09] <Schalken> mapilot, i prefer not to tweak
[04:10] <Madpilot> webhed, what type of file system?
[04:10] <webhed> vfat, its the ipod thats giving me issues with some files I can't delete
[04:10] <webhed> they are named like..
[04:10] <Madpilot> Schalken, there's an app called qt-config that lets you change qt/kde appearance in non-qt/kde enviroments
[04:10] <webhed> ??^????h.???
[04:10] <webhed> and
[04:10] <webhed> *???np\?.sg?
[04:10] <webhed> those are the filenames
[04:10] <dli> foxgamer, then, you don't have to format
[04:11] <webhed> but when I try to delete them I get:
[04:11] <webhed> rm: cannot remove `\353z\347?v]  ?.9\355\f': Read-only file system
[04:11] <webhed> and here is results from running 'mount' : "/dev/sdc2 on /media/ipod type vfat (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,umask=0000)"
[04:11] <Schalken> madpilot, but that would required tinkering, i dont have time to tinker. since im in GNOME im going to run only GNOME apps so they always look and work the way they should. eh?
[04:12] <foxgamer> dli, Just install over the top? So it'll keep the files on my computer? How about settings of things like gnome?
[04:12] <Madpilot> Schalken, fair enough - the tools are available, though
[04:12] <noiesmo> Schalken, rythmbox might be the go for you
[04:12] <dli> foxgamer, use a livecd to delete system folders, like " /usr /lib /bin /sbin /opt /share /var "
[04:12] <andrejkw> How to use glxgears to check fps?
[04:12] <mc|amb> hi, im trying to install lame but it doesn't apper in synaptic... and i have multiverse repository activated
[04:12] <dli> foxgamer, and make sure you don't format the partition during installation
[04:12] <Schalken> lol! i also like to keep things simple. one media player (totem) is enough for me
[04:13] <Schalken> hehehe
[04:13] <noiesmo> Schalken, rhythmbox opps
[04:13] <dli> andrejkw, glxgears -printfps
[04:13] <Schalken> opps?
[04:13] <maxkelley> wheee, modprobe is my friend

[04:19] <webhed> I unmounted it then remounted rw just to make sure that wasn't it
[04:19] <ZeXr0> then I couldn't tell, would be easier if you format the ipod using Itunes on a windows computer, I know this solution sucks, but it's 20minutes for VMware setup, 40minutes for windows, 5 minutes for Itunes, 5 minutes to format, and 10 seconde to remove vmware and windows

[04:21] <tonyyarusso> Boelcke_: gui or cli?
[04:21] <issaker> tonyyarusso, how bout removing grub?
[04:21] <Boelcke_> Tony, either, please.  I'm using Gnome.
[04:21] <foxgamer> Boelcke_, type df in the terminal
[04:21] <tonyyarusso> issaker: You can use dd to set the bits to 0.
[04:21] <biovore> Boelcke_: use df -h

[04:22] <Madpilot> blaze, open it, then log out and make sure the "Save Session" checkbox is checked
[04:22] <ZeXr0> lol
[04:22] <sas171> biovore: mine is supporting it... actually, but seems like the system isnt supporting my soundcard. So it was my question, maybe there is a way to get it running...
[04:22] <blaze> but can't i tell
[04:22] <issaker> sonyyarysso, what?
[04:22] <Madpilot> blaze, sorry, "Save Current Session"
[04:22] <ZeXr0> webhed if HFS+ is supported by linux ?
[04:22] <blaze> ubuntu to start it everytime
[04:22] <Boelcke_> Thanks!
[04:22] <Boelcke_> Oh, wow, that's small.  I
[04:22] <blaze> without save Current Session?
[04:22] <crimsun> sas171: / biovore: most chipsets within the last nine years support full duplex. Many of them don't support pcm multiplexing.
[04:22] <issaker> tonyyarusso, can you elaborate?
[04:23] <Madpilot> blaze, that's what Save Current Session is for
[04:23] <webhed> Zexro: I think so but I just tried to create a partition in gparted and it didnt even do anything.
[04:23] <foxgamer> Boelcke_, if you want something a bit fancier, try the desklets.
[04:23] <blaze> ok Madpilot, 10x :)
[04:23] <Boelcke_> I've had Ubuntu on my second machine for a few months now, adding software left and right, and I just wanted to see how much space I've taken up.
[04:23] <Seantater> hum -- ever read ubotu's "helpful" answer when he does not know a factoid you try to get him to tell you?
[04:23] <Boelcke_> Only 3.1gb!
[04:23] <webhed> I was going to leave it fat just in case there were any issues with hfs
[04:23] <Madpilot> Seantater, the one about his cat's name? ;)
[04:23] <Seantater> specifically: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/,
[04:23] <tonyyarusso> issaker: If you open a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal) and type man dd in it and hit enter, you'll get all kinds of information about the command.  'man man' will tell you more about that functionality.
[04:23] <biovore> sas171: well make sure you have your record sources set correctly..  with alsa use alsamixer not the gui one.  there might have to play with ac97 levels as well

[04:24] <lime4by4> which is better the default disk install or eraese with lvm?
[04:24] <ZeXr0> Might be somehow usefull
[04:24] <issaker> tonyyarusso, do i do that under ubuntu?
[04:24] <Boelcke_> I carved out 80gb when I installed it, only 77 left!!!
[04:24] <Madpilot> smacky_wolf, #ubuntu+1
[04:24] <webhed> checking now Zexro: thanks
[04:24] <smacky_wolf> Thanks <3
[04:24] <tonyyarusso> issaker: Yes.
[04:24] <Seantater> Is that not pointless, that's a list of factoids he knows, he already searched them -- you searching them will not help the matter!
[04:24] <tonyyarusso> issaker: Man pages are available online too.
[04:24] <MorbidHunger> wats the command to use when using a new video card?
[04:24] <tonyyarusso> (Google will be useful if you need to go that route.)
[04:24] <issaker> thanks
[04:25] <webhed> ugh, that requires booting an OSX install disk lol
[04:25] <Boelcke_> Interestingly, I was just checking, because I'm now demoting XP on my primary machine, and wanted to know how big to make the Ubuntu partition.
[04:25] <sas171> crimsun: / biovore: I have 4 (at least) devices in the /proc -> pcm0c, pcm0p, pcm1c, pcm2p so it seems like my soundcard is ok for that: 1 fullduplex dev + 2 separated...
[04:25] <ZeXr0> webhed : http://pag.csail.mit.edu/~adonovan/hacks/ipod.html
[04:25] <ZeXr0> another website that might help
[04:25] <Boelcke_> Thanks for the help, folks...
[04:26] <helpneeded> hi can someone give advice on a problem im having trying to install dapper
[04:26] <foxgamer> MorbidHunger, what command do you mean?
[04:26] <crimsun> sas171: you can't tell from the device nodes whether it is.
[04:26] <MorbidHunger> to like reconfigure the xserver or something like that
[04:26] <webhed> that one will likely take hours upon hours to do... I was hoping for something a little easier, not that I'm not appreciative Zexro
[04:26] <sas171> crimsun: hm, how else can I check this?
[04:26] <MorbidHunger> is it sudo depg-reconfigure xserver?
[04:27] <MorbidHunger> dpkg*
[04:27] <ZeXr0> well just take a look if the filesystem needs files
[04:27] <foxgamer> dpkg?
[04:27] <lin> how do you run a script?
[04:27] <webhed> what do you mean Zex
[04:27] <tonyyarusso> Seantater: No, ubotu only checks exactly what you said.  You can use /msg ubotu listvals something to search though.
[04:27] <issaker> tonyyarusso, which what do i set to zero?
[04:27] <lakez> is ubuntu probably the best distro for latest SATA2 support?
[04:27] <crimsun> sas171: what chipset is it?
[04:27] <lakez> my freebsd machine is screwed
[04:27] <webhed> and are there other ubuntu chans I could pop into? I can't do a /list for some reason
[04:27] <biovore> sata2 works good on newer linux kernels
[04:27] <lin> how do you execute a bash script?
[04:27] <ZeXr0> webhed well what I have read, is that the Ipod does not have a database of the files
[04:27] <neoncode> Hello, I was ripping a CD, then I accsidently cut the power to my PC. I rebooted and now it's stuck in 640x680 when it was working perfectly before in 1024x768
[04:27] <foxgamer> MorbidHunger, Just checked, it's "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
[04:27] <sas171> crimsun: nvidia2 on an asus motheboard if you want i can give exact info
[04:28] <biovore> ./script.sh
[04:28] <MorbidHunger> oh
[04:28] <tonyyarusso> issaker: It's the first so many bits on the disk, not sure about specifics.  The real question is why, since any other installer will install a new MBR.
[04:28] <MorbidHunger> thanx
[04:28] <ZeXr0> it's just a logical sorting with the id3tags
[04:28] <Seantater> tonyyarusso: then why not have him redirect you to that, rather than to have you search through thousands of factoids, twenty at a time?!
[04:28] <MorbidHunger> i forgot 1 letter!!
[04:28] <neoncode> Can anyone help me?
[04:28] <issaker> tonyyarusso o
[04:28] <tonyyarusso> webhed: Tons.  There's a wiki page somewhere...  (If you search wiki.ubuntu.com for irc you'll find them)
[04:29] <helpneeded> can someone tell me whay during text install cd screen goes total back and pc freezes ?
[04:29] <crimsun> sas171: that's full duplex and pcm multiopen, but Nvidia refuses to open the specs, so you're stuck with the "compatible" driver, snd_intel8x0
[04:29] <lin> biovore when i run that i get permission denied
[04:29] <tonyyarusso> Seantater: Now that I do not know.  Take it up with crimsun I guess.  (The ubotu usage wiki will tell you that though - maybe should go there.)
[04:29] <neoncode> Anyone? This is realy annoying...
[04:29] <Madpilot> neoncode, System->Preferences->Screen Resolution
[04:29] <biovore> lin: chmod +x script.sh then run it
[04:29] <lin> ok
[04:30] <ZeXr0> webhed : saving the first 32MB of the second partition, which contains the iPod firmware image. Keep this file safe somewhere on your PC. (During FAT conversion, this will be your only copy of the iPod firmware as it arrives from the factory; if for some reason you need to repeat the conversion process, do not overwrite this file!)
[04:30] <docta_v> neoncode: set your resolution manually in xorg.conf
[04:30] <neoncode> docta_v: It is, it's set heigher.
[04:30] <neoncode> Madpilot: It won't let me put it heigher
[04:30] <ZeXr0> for the rest I don't even know if there something important on the ipod
[04:30] <crimsun> tonyyarusso: ?
[04:30] <Seantater> hey -- crimsun -- are you here?
[04:31] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell neoncode about fixres
[04:31] <helpneeded> anyone ?
[04:31] <sas171> crimsun: what do you mean? is there a light at the end of the tunnel? )
[04:31] <Madpilot> neoncode, check the PM you just got from the bot
[04:31] <lakez> does ubuntu have 'ports' ?  I'm so used to freebsd.. maybe i should check out their live cd or something and see if the network smokes
[04:31] <webhed> Zexro: The ipod is currently mounted on /dev/sdc2, can I just do something like mount /dev/sdc1 /<somewhere> even though I don't see a /dev/sdc1 in the /dev dir?
[04:31] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: bot related question.
[04:31] <webhed> because I think its the big 20gb partition that is sdc2
[04:31] <crimsun> sas171: you have two choices: 1) use nvsound from Nvidia's Web site, which will support what you want, but it conflicts with ALSA. 2) Use ALSA, but you can't run OSS apps and ALSA apps natively simultaneously.
[04:31] <webhed> and the small one should be sdc1 I think
[04:32] <ZeXr0> that I don't know, my knowledge of linux and filesystem are limited, what I'm trying to see of what this guys saves
[04:32] <webhed> but I dont see an sdc1 in the dev dir
[04:32] <starrry> hi all, which source contain the package **sun-j2re1.5**?? I can't apt-get install directly
[04:32] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: Rather than sifting through the factoids 20 at a time on that site, why not have the "I don't know response" tell people about listvals and listkeys?
[04:32] <crimsun> tonyyarusso: what specifically about the bot? (I don't control the bot whatsoever.)
[04:32] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: I thought you did...am I mistaken?
[04:32] <crimsun> yes, you are.
=== HellDragon` is now known as HellDragon|Bot
[04:32] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: Dang.
[04:32] <issaker> hey guys
=== HellDragon|Bot is now known as HellDragon|
[04:32] <tonyyarusso> My memory's not what it used to be.
[04:33] <issaker> do you suggest dual-booting or virtual machine?
[04:33] <ZeXr0> webhed : fromweb:  If all goes well, resetting the iPod (by holding Menu and Play for 5 seconds) will cause it to reboot to the familiar menus. If not, go through the instructions again. Remember, the iPod is just a hard-disc, so as long as you have the original firmware backed-up correctly and safely on the PC, you can reformat it as many times as you like. (It worked for me first time.) [Be very wary about installing different firm
[04:33] <tonyyarusso> crimsun: Oh yes.  (You both start with a C, sorry.)
=== HellDragon| is now known as HellDragon`
[04:33] <tonyyarusso> Seantater: My bad, wrong contact.
[04:33] <Madpilot> neoncode, something's messed up your resolution - check that URL, it can't hurt. (and please keep tech support questions in-channel, it's more useful for everyone...)
[04:33] <tonyyarusso> Seantater: It's cafuego that's responsible for the bot.
[04:34] <neoncode> Madpilot: Ah ok, sorry for /msging you
[04:34] <issaker> anyone? dual-booting vs virtual machine
[04:34] <neoncode> Madpilot: I have tried reconfigureing my xorg.conf though...
[04:34] <Seantater> tonyyarusso: let us hope he is awake/here
[04:34] <ZeXr0> issaker: depends of your needs
[04:34] <issaker> zexr0, needs like what?
[04:34] <ZeXr0> virtual machine, you'll be able to let linux running while using windows
[04:35] <Madpilot> neoncode, was the monitor turned off while the machine booted?
[04:35] <Seantater> cafuego_: are you here?
[04:35] <ZeXr0> issaker : do you plan on using Windows a lot ? or just once in a while for specific thigs
[04:35] <neoncode> Madpilot: No
[04:35] <tonyyarusso> Seantater: You can always try another time (or maybe memoserv if he hasn't disabled it)
[04:35] <lakez> Does the Ubuntu Live CD have UFS support in it?  I want to test the live cd to see if my network caps out with Ubuntu and it is in fact a freebsd 6.0 driver issue...
[04:35] <webhed> I already hard-booted it and it says its empty but when I mount it and look at it by cd'ing to /media/ipod, I see the base file system there and there are corrupt looking files there I want to get rid of.
[04:35] <issaker> zexr0 i use windows mainly
=== Managu_away is now known as Managu
[04:36] <sas171> crimsun: I read the howto at linux-gamers and its pretty th same what i need, the problem is only, that i have /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss where my teamspeak sound should go, but no /proc/asound/card0/pcm2p/oss, where my et sound should go, so I have the folder but no oss link. Can you tell something about this? Maybe some confgi for oss-pcm kernelmod?
[04:36] <Madpilot> neoncode, OK - there's an xorg bug I've run into that it sets itself back to 640x400 if it can't detect a monitor during boot - but I really have no idea what's causing your issue, then - but double check that Fixres page...
[04:37] <neoncode> Madpilot: Ok, thanks
[04:37] <ZeXr0> webhed : well just try to find information about the files in the Ipod, from what I saw, it seems that if you have the firmware (read the webpage for instruction) then you could erase the big part of the ipod wihought caring, if you can read/write, you could try backupping theses files, and then rewriting them if something fails
[04:37] <ZeXr0> issaker : and do you plan on switching to linux
[04:37] <issaker> zexr0, i dunno, im new to linux
[04:37] <crimsun> sas171: probably because your primary sound device lacks three playback subdevices.
[04:38] <webhed> I even tried fsck /dev/sdc2 but it errors out on me
[04:38] <ZeXr0> issaker : well if you don't care about data (or that you have backup) the best way to learn is to install linux as the primary partition, and try to do everything with linux, install windows on VMware just to be sure you can really do everything you need (Like if you can't/don't know how to do something)
[04:39] <ZeXr0> issaker : that's what I'll do in a couple of hour
[04:39] <Seantater> how does one use memoserv in freenode?
[04:39] <ZeXr0> /memoserv help
[04:39] <sas171> crimsun: i dont understand what do you mean with subdevice and device...
[04:40] <issaker> zexr0, thanks, i'll do that
[04:40] <webhed> and I tried rm -d -R *
[04:40] <Seantater> z3r0x: thanks
[04:40] <crimsun> sas171: each device has a number of subdevices. Look at /proc/asound/devices
[04:40] <Seantater> z3r0x: oops -- wrong person
[04:40] <Seantater> ZeXr0:  thanks
[04:41] <tonyyarusso> Wow those are similar.

[04:42] <HellDragon`Py> theres a limewire on ubuntu?
[04:42] <HellDragon`Py> interesting
[04:42] <sas171> crimsun: hm, seems like my card0 has 5 devices then: playback, capture, midi and 2 ctl
[04:43] <PVZ> HellDragon`Py: yes,you just need to "sudo alien" the rpm package available on www.limewire.com

[04:46] <sas171> Schalken: sure, you need graphiccard drivers
[04:46] <neoncode> Well that's somewhat better. I went and removed all refrences to 640x860 in my xorg.conf and now it seems to work... needs a little tweeking though...
[04:46] <ZeXr0> removing the # in front of something %
[04:46] <ZeXr0> maybe ?
[04:46] <Schalken> or maybe the //

[04:52] <minilek> do you have to reinstall the driver there, or is it a matter of just changing your xorg.conf in the chroot ?
[04:52] <Plouj> and what is the GNOME alternative to amarok?
[04:53] <nutterpc> doesn't look like there's a Linux version at all

[04:53] <ZeXr0> you could dual boot AND use this parition in VMWare
[04:53] <issaker> or dual-boot it?

[04:54] <ZeXr0> that way you could use windows on linux for everyday purpose, and if you do not have enought power (performance) for a game, then you could just dual boot and play it without linux

[04:55] <crimsun> sas171: no, you should concern yourself with only pcm0p and pcm0c

[05:02] <Madpilot> emptyshell, start Synaptic and search for 'fonts' - there are a fair number of font packages
[05:02] <ZeXr0> apt-get update
[05:02] <issaker> first thing it told me is that there's a bunch of updates, then i updated it
[05:02] <ZeXr0> apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:02] <pegasus1234> any ideas for a novices first install///
[05:02] <pegasus1234> ???
[05:02] <yancheng> For Makefile rule %.o : %.c
[05:02] <yancheng> 	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDE) -o $@ $< , how can i make %.o olso depends on a build directory? so that a build dir will be mkdir before object file is written?
[05:02] <issaker> k
[05:02] <Madpilot> emptyshell, also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FontInstallHowto
[05:03] <nutterpc> pegasus1234, do you need a firewall?
[05:03] <ZeXr0> pegasus1234
[05:03] <pegasus1234> yup
[05:03] <krut> Why isn't Winamp running?
[05:03] <Madpilot> pegasus1234, are you running a web server?
[05:03] <dewbie> krut use XMMS
[05:03] <dewbie> its basically the same thing
[05:03] <krut> but I just installed winamp3. :/
[05:03] <nutterpc> pegasus1234, is it for a desktop box?
[05:03] <dewbie> lol why
[05:03] <krut> Because I like winamp
[05:03] <krut> but it won't execute
[05:03] <paca> I'm under the impression I am supposed to hear something when I hover over an ogg file, is this not correct?
[05:03] <dewbie> XMMS is basically the same thing
[05:03] <Madpilot> krut, there's a Linux version of winamp?
[05:03] <pegasus1234> i dont know, im on broadband, so i must be.../
[05:04] <krut> yeah Madpilot.
[05:04] <MorbidHunger> someone link me to newest version of easy ubuntu?
[05:04] <Schalken> are there seperate video drivers for different x servers?
[05:04] <nutterpc> pegasus1234, there's many firewalls out there
[05:04] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell MorbidHunger about easyubuntu
[05:04] <pegasus1234> it is for a desktop box nuuter
[05:04] <nutterpc> depends what features ur lookin for
[05:04] <car25> hello
[05:04] <Madpilot> pegasus1234, install Firestarter, it's easy and it's in Ubuntu's repositories
[05:04] <MorbidHunger> thanx mate
[05:04] <pegasus1234> i thought firestarter, basic and simple..
[05:04] <dewbie> I still can't install this driver for my Intel 945GM PCI Express :(
[05:04] <sas171> crimsun: do you mean that one -> http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_nforce_1.0-0306.html ? i allready played with that and thought ill get the same sound system as i have now...
[05:04] <nutterpc> I'd 2nd that idea Madpilot
[05:05] <nutterpc> Firestarter is pretty simple
[05:05] <crimsun> sas171: nvsound is not alsa-based at all
[05:05] <krut> Madpilot: http://www.filepedia.com/alternative_platforms/linux_software/winamp_for_linux.cfm
[05:05] <nutterpc> I'm actually running my own custom one, lol, took me long enough to build
[05:05] <crimsun> sas171: you won't be messing with /proc/asound whatsoever
[05:05] <Madpilot> krut, interesting - can't see the point, but still interesting
[05:05] <dewbie> heh
[05:05] <dewbie> XMMS is winamp for linux
[05:06] <Plouj> is there a way to convert from dapper to the stable version of ubuntu?
[05:06] <sas171> crimsun: ok, im trying that. thank you for the help
[05:06] <dewbie> or so I thought
[05:06] <pegasus1234> madpilot, what do i do after accessing the instructions on ubuntu homepage??
[05:06] <Madpilot> pegasus1234, instructions for what?
[05:06] <dewbie> am I alone in this assertion?
[05:06] <Shadowline> Ploug: wait 4-5 days and Dapper will be the stable version
[05:06] <nutterpc> and I found Flash & Java easier to get going on Ubuntu x64 than first thought
[05:06] <pegasus1234> downloading firestarter...
[05:07] <issaker> zexr0 it wont lemme get update unless im root
[05:07] <Madpilot> pegasus1234, Applications menu->Add Applications, search for firestarter, install it
[05:07] <nutterpc> everyone on the forums said it was basically a case of going 32bit to get flash & java
[05:07] <nutterpc> I didn't
[05:07] <helpneeded> nutter if you get a chance check the link in the pm
[05:07] <nutterpc> and both are working perfectly
[05:07] <nutterpc> I don't see a pm helpneeded
[05:07] <pegasus1234> sounds like a pen and paper job, as this is my first download on linux
[05:07] <MorbidHunger> so wats this baby really do?

[05:10] <issaker> how do i update ubuntu in ubuntu?
[05:10] <dewbie> I think everyone has totally ignored me
[05:10] <Madpilot> pegasus1234, you don't need to download stuff off the web in Ubuntu - use Add Applications or Synaptic, let it handle the installs from the online repositories
[05:10] <nutterpc> dewbie, no ones ignored ya
[05:10] <issaker> it wont let me do anything if im not root
[05:10] <MorbidHunger> i got this running easy ubuntu

[05:10] <Madpilot> issaker, what are you trying to do?
[05:10] <dewbie> I have a bit of a technical issue
[05:11] <issaker> update breezy to dapper
[05:11] <dewbie> also
[05:11] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell issaker about upgrade
[05:11] <nutterpc> lemme have a bit of a think about that prob helpneeded
[05:11] <helpneeded> cool ...
[05:11] <nutterpc> dewbie, what sort of technical prob?
[05:12] <kholerabbi> Does anyone know a Desktop search, like Google's, for ubuntu?
[05:12] <sas171> crimsun: hm, it wants kernel-source package (cant find kernel source tree) what should i install?
[05:12] <Madpilot> issaker, Ubuntu doesn't use root - use sudo and your own user pw - and when it asks for a pw in the GUI, use your own user pw there too
[05:12] <sas171> kholerabbi: deskbar
[05:12] <crimsun> sas171: linux-headers-$(uname -r)
[05:12] <kholerabbi> cheers
[05:12] <issaker> oh
[05:12] <dewbie> I have a verizon wireless internet card
[05:12] <dewbie> PCMCIA
[05:12] <nutterpc> not recognizing?
[05:12] <sas171> thx
[05:12] <crimsun> sas171: if you're on breezy, you'll also need gcc-3.4 and build-essential
[05:12] <dewbie> it won't run at boot
[05:12] <nutterpc> ahh
[05:12] <sas171> crimsun: im on dapper
[05:12] <nutterpc> sounds like a job for ndiswrapper
[05:12] <nutterpc> :)
[05:12] <crimsun> sas171: if you're on dapper, you'll just need build-essential in addition
[05:12] <dewbie> only when I type pppd call 1xevdo
[05:13] <nutterpc> hehe
[05:13] <Madpilot> issaker, read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo if you haven't already
[05:13] <dewbie> problem is I think I have two different driver modules loading at boot and it won't pick the right one
[05:13] <issaker> thanks madpilot
[05:13] <dewbie> it fails 3 or 4 times then about 5 minutes aftr the finish of boot, it will connect
[05:14] <neoncode> After all that... problem solved...
[05:14] <nutterpc> what modules have u got set to load at startup?
[05:14] <dewbie> I have the /var/log/messages
[05:15] <neoncode> For anyone who was following my complaints of crappy resoloution before... The soloution.. My monitor cable was loose.
[05:15] <dewbie> lp
[05:15] <dewbie> mousedev
[05:15] <dewbie> psmouse
[05:15] <dewbie> sbp2
[05:15] <dewbie> usbserial vendor=0x106c product=0x3701
[05:15] <nutterpc> hmms ok
[05:15] <dewbie> neoncode good thing to check before hand :P
[05:15] <Madpilot> neoncode, heh. That's always tech support question number 1: Is it plugged in? Are you sure? ;)
[05:16] <Honzo> hello everyone.  I have a few questions for whoever wants to answer them
[05:16] <dewbie> the usbserial thing is (I think) correct
[05:16] <dewbie> I checked it before and after plugging (inserting) the card
[05:16] <Madpilot> Honzo, welcome to #ubuntu - and please just ask, don't ask to ask
[05:17] <Honzo> alright
[05:17] <neoncode> I was trying to plug a usb cable into the back of my computer and I pushed on the front of the computer for support. My hand sliped and I hit the power button. I didnt want it to turn off so I held it down while I was thinking and i forgot that holding down the power button cuts the power. I guess I knocked the monitor cable
[05:17] <Honzo> would ubuntu be easy for me to jump into from windows?
[05:17] <nutterpc> Honzo, relatively so
[05:17] <NickGarvey> neoncode: ouch
[05:17] <Honzo> i used to use red hat, but it was a little to complicated for me to understand installing programs and such
[05:18] <nutterpc> Honzo, depends what hardware you use
[05:18] <helpneeded> wants to move from windows  but cant get it installed  lol
[05:18] <ben_underscore> anyone know anything about banshee and connecting up an ipod on breezy?
[05:18] <vinboy> hi
[05:18] <Honzo> well i have a custom computer right now... athlon 2500
[05:18] <Honzo> 512 mb memory
[05:18] <vinboy> how do I uninstall the nvidia driver?
[05:18] <dewbie> installing it is easy, working out the kinks... after installing it on a cutting edge, brand new laptop is the problem
[05:19] <NickGarvey> good luck
[05:19] <Honzo> how compatible is all my hardware? will i have any driver problems you thing?
[05:19] <Honzo> *think?
[05:19] <Honzo> it's pretty generic stuff
[05:20] <NickGarvey> Honzo: I have an athlon 3200+ and it works fine
[05:20] <NickGarvey> 512 RAM
[05:20] <dewbie> once I get my video installed (another small) problem, everything but the ACPI and the biometric scanner will work flawlessly
[05:20] <sas171> crimsun: ok, its compiled now. How can I change the sound config now?
[05:20] <nutterpc> Honzo, would need to know all your hardware in ur system to be able to tell if you'd have a smooth transition
[05:20] <crimsun> sas171: unload all the alsa modules, blacklist snd, reboot.
[05:20] <Honzo> alright. lemme check some of my stuff
[05:20] <dewbie> any ideas
[05:21] <whiter> I MIGHT HAVE ONE
[05:21] <Honzo> i have a radeon 9200+
[05:21] <whiter> i might have one*

[05:24] <crimsun> sas171: eh, just blacklist snd by doing this: echo snd |sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[05:24] <crimsun> sas171: then reboot
[05:25] <dewbie> TonyKite, its the same as the first user created
[05:25] <ZeXr0> TonyKite : google Ubuntu Livecd root password
[05:25] <TonyKite> there was no user created tho
[05:25] <crimsun> sas171: sorry, that should read: echo "blacklist snd" |sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[05:25] <nutterpc> helpneeded, so are you on a different machine?
[05:25] <nutterpc> and have that laptop near you?

[05:28] <nutterpc> the Function Keys (F1, F2, etc etc) press then, see what options it gives you
[05:28] <sonojacker> for mpg files

[05:29] <TonyKite> bad superblock
[05:30] <sonojacker> ... is anyone watching DVD's in DApper AMD64?
[05:30] <nutterpc> dewbie, I know about patience being a virtue, took me about 5-6hours or so to get Ubuntu x64 working with everything I normally use, and that includes Flash & Java
[05:30] <nutterpc> and also a bit of speed optimizations to it as well
[05:30] <dewbie> lol
[05:30] <ZeXr0> That's out of my knowledge
[05:31] <siimo> hi i just started my computer and updated my breezy system (just security updates etc)  and then GDM gave an error message about some theme not found .. so i rebooted and now my computer will not start anymore... not even POST beep and nothing on screen.... is it dead? :/
[05:31] <TonyKite> is there a way to probe the kernel to see which fs's it supports?
[05:31] <nutterpc> siimo, try a CMOS reset
[05:31] <siimo> nutterpc: as in remove the CMOS battery?
[05:31] <nutterpc> there should be a cmos reset jumper on the mobo
[05:32] <nutterpc> near the cmos battery
[05:32] <Madpilot> removing the coms battery would also work, though ;)
[05:32] <siimo> all fans are spinning and theres no error beeps... just that screen wont start and system is not booting AT ALL
[05:32] <nutterpc> yer :P
[05:32] <helpneeded> sorry cant find teh disk re writing another
[05:32] <nutterpc> pull the power cord out when u do it too siimo
[05:32] <siimo> ok and if that doesnt work what do i do? probably the PSU?
[05:32] <nutterpc> leave it sit for about 30seconds
[05:32] <MorbidHunger> siimo, that always works
[05:33] <nutterpc> then plug the power back in
[05:33] <siimo> its my sisters computer so shes gonna start bitching at me soon as soon as she needs it :S
[05:33] <nutterpc> try that, see if it works
[05:33] <MorbidHunger> tell her to piss off
[05:33] <nutterpc> lol
[05:33] <MorbidHunger> i do that all the time at school
[05:34] <dewbie> fakeroot doesn't work either in the commandline... am I missing something?
[05:34] <dewbie> bash: fakeroot: command not found
[05:34] <nutterpc> have to admit one thing tho, Ubuntu x64 does lag a bit when you first install it
[05:34] <nutterpc> after you cut out some of the crap, she's running like greased owlpoo :)
[05:34] <dewbie> trying to install java while I wait
[05:35] <TonyKite> actually it worked heh
[05:35] <TonyKite> it was defaulting to 44bsd
[05:35] <yancheng> in Makefile, how i can specific "All .o file in xxx directory"??
[05:36] <MorbidHunger> my comp still has no sound..
[05:36] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, what soundcard>?
[05:37] <TonyKite> what's "disklabel" equivalent to in ubuntu?
[05:37] <Michael`123> Hello. I have two hard drives: /dev/sda and /dev/hdb. The MBR is apparently on /dev/hdb, but it needs to be moved to /dev/sda. I Googled it, but I didn't find much. Apparently Windows has a method for doing that, but I don't know...I am trying to get GRUB to install properly, so I need to get the MBR moved...
[05:37] <MorbidHunger> ensoniq
[05:37] <nutterpc> chipset?
[05:37] <mjg> Is there a link explaining what "Karma" is in Launchpad? Thanks.
[05:37] <Versed> upgraded the g4 450 tonight to dapper from breezy, runs real nice, seems faster.
[05:37] <MorbidHunger> i dont remmeber
[05:37] <nutterpc> need to know the chipset MorbidHunger
[05:38] <MorbidHunger> id have to take it out and restart
[05:38] <MorbidHunger> :(
[05:38] <MorbidHunger> ill brb
[05:38] <nutterpc> hang on
[05:38] <Versed> only thing I didn't care for is the lame assed gnome version of xchat, installed the regular one, was no big deal.
[05:38] <nutterpc> have u got ssh running?
[05:38] <helpneeded> nutter this is the text based install cd ????
[05:38] <siimo> nutterpc: ok did a CMOS reset gonna reconnect and try now... BRB
[05:38] <MorbidHunger> ssh?
[05:38] <sas171> crimsun: I made it, but i see (hear =)) no changes
[05:38] <nutterpc> ssh MorbidHunger is secure shell
[05:38] <sas171> crimsun: how can I check what modules are loaded?
[05:38] <nutterpc> allows someone to remotely connect to help fix problems
[05:39] <crimsun> sas171: lsmod
[05:39] <MorbidHunger> how do i check if its running?
[05:39] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, bring up a prompt
[05:39] <nutterpc> sudo su
[05:39] <nutterpc> then ur password
[05:39] <matti> Michael`123: And, what you want to do?
[05:39] <MorbidHunger> i got that..
[05:39] <matti> Michael`123: Install grub on sda?
[05:39] <nutterpc> and type /etc/init.d/sshd status
[05:39] <nutterpc> should tell you what its doing
[05:40] <MorbidHunger> bash: /etc/init.d/sshd: No such file or directory
[05:40] <sas171> crimsun: snd is still loaded...
[05:40] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, install ssh
[05:40] <MorbidHunger> ubuntu detects the card amd everything
[05:40] <TonyKite> how do you get eth0 to run DHCP on a live machine?
[05:40] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, if u can install ssh, I'll see what I can do to help ya
[05:40] <crimsun> sas171: that's not as important as snd_intel8x0 and snd_ac97_codec /not/ being loaded
[05:40] <MorbidHunger> thanx mate
[05:40] <Michael`123> matti, Yes, install GRUB on sda
[05:40] <sonojacker> hello crimsun. I know this is a package related question but: do you know how can we access libxine-extracodecs for mp3 audio in xine based players?
[05:41] <eggzeck> MorbidHunger, it's not ssh you need to install
[05:41] <eggzeck> MorbidHunger, it's the ssh server
[05:41] <matti> Michael`123: If you want move contant of the hdb MBR, you can use dd, but this is not very good idea. Either way, you can instsall on sda, and then chainload Windows as well.
[05:41] <eggzeck> MorbidHunger, sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[05:41] <LinuxBenny> I got a problem with my Linux perhaps maybe someone can help me with.
[05:41] <sEbaKiLLeR> hi
[05:41] <nutterpc> helpneeded, what options pressing the Function keys do you get to choose from
[05:41] <sonojacker> what happened LinuxBenny?
[05:41] <matti> Michael`123: OK, have /boot partition or /boot on root partition? ;] 
[05:41] <patch> know someboy where can I get MBrola ?
[05:42] <sas171> crimsun: they are both there too
[05:42] <TonyKite> hrmm eth1 worked
[05:42] <Michael`123> matti, I'm sorry?
[05:42] <matti> s/instsall/install/
[05:42] <sEbaKiLLeR> anyone know why ubuntu update Xserver?
[05:42] <crimsun> sas171: then unload them, blacklist snd_ac97_codec and snd_intel8x0
[05:42] <sEbaKiLLeR> security, performance?
[05:42] <LinuxBenny> will you see i got this problem i can't install anything. For one reason or not the one program i need is locked because i am not loged in as the Root. What i need is the password so i can get into the root and use the program i need.
[05:43] <TonyKite> which ftp program can you use on livecd?
[05:43] <Michael`123> matti, Here is what happened: sda was the slave, hdb was master, but hdb was changed to slave, but the MBR remains on hdb, and hence on GRUB install, the MBR evidently is written on sda, but apparently Windows overrides it or something
[05:43] <TonyKite> ftpd rather
[05:43] <Dr_Willis> LinuxBenny,  what program?
[05:43] <siimo> nutterpc: now it has a long beep and then beeps 3 times and beeps again and nothing happens :S
[05:43] <sas171> crimsun: I added "blacklist snd" should i remove it again?
[05:43] <MorbidHunger> LinuxBenny: sudo su
[05:43] <nutterpc> siimo, you have a hardware problem now
[05:43] <crimsun> sas171: doesn't matter.
[05:43] <siimo> nutterpc: what is it likely to be?
[05:43] <matti> Michael`123: So, system on hdb boot always as first, right?
[05:44] <LinuxBenny> it is the kynaptic program'
[05:44] <nutterpc> siimo, videocard
[05:44] <Michael`123> matti, The data on the hdb MBR always boots, yes (although what it actually boots is on sda)
[05:44] <Dr_Willis> LinuxBenny,  'sudo whateverprogram'  is the normal way to run somthing as root.
[05:44] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc it installed it somewhere else
[05:44] <siimo> nutterpc: thanks will try
[05:44] <matti> Michael`123: As "sda" you mind some SATA controller?
[05:44] <nutterpc> okies MorbidHunger
[05:45] <Michael`123> matti, Serial ATA hard drive, yeah
[05:45] <TonyKite> Does anyone know of an ftpd program on livecd ?  I
[05:45] <LinuxBenny> will why can i not log in as root isn't that my right as the Pc owner?
[05:45] <TonyKite> I've mounted my freebsd drive, i just want to test the speeds on my network using livecd
[05:45] <Dr_Willis> TonyKite,  theres a slax variant that has several servers on it.
[05:45] <dewbie> wtf make-jpkg can't be found ugh
[05:45] <nutterpc> LinuxBenny, are you trying to run as root instead of sudo su?
[05:45] <TonyKite> dr-willis, slax = inetd ?  or xinetd equiv ?
[05:45] <ZeXr0> TonyKite sudo -s apt-get install ftpd
[05:45] <matti> Michael`123: OK, take a little experiment - plug off PATA HDD for a second, and try if boot code (or for shot sda) will boot.
[05:46] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc: what else should i do?
[05:46] <LinuxBenny> will i can't run the program i need i am not the most Linux friendly this is my first Linux and i don't know much.
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> TonyKite,  slax is a live cd.  - that has a ftp server.. :P most all the live cd's can work as a FTP CLIENT.
[05:46] <Dr_Willis> TonyKite,  I missread what you asked. lol.
[05:46] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, if you can get me the chipset of that soundcard, I'll see what I can dig up
[05:46] <dewbie> I can't find make-jpkg in any of the repositories nor anywhere else
[05:46] <Michael`123> matti, Ah, good idea. I will go try -- be back in ~10 min
[05:46] <matti> Michael`123: I've similar problem on my desktop machine - when any PATA is plugged, he always boot first. And I've PCI SATA controller...
[05:47] <MorbidHunger> alright
[05:47] <MorbidHunger> bvrb
[05:47] <matti> Michael`123: If this will work, the seatch BIOS for SCSI or non-ATA in menu, where the boot-order is placed.
[05:47] <nutterpc> LinuxBenny, try bringin up a prompt, type in sudo su, when it asks for a password, enter your normal password you use to login, and hit enter
[05:47] <dumaiso> anyway of installing intel 537ep modem on ubuntu?
[05:47] <TonyKite> ZeXr0, E: cound't find package ftpd
[05:47] <matti> s/seatch/search/
[05:47] <T`> anyone here uses bcm43xx based wifi card in their laptop? i don't think mine is working.. it says softMAC connected, but dont think i can send any packets.. no dhcp working ,etc.
[05:47] <nutterpc> then try running the program again
[05:47] <TonyKite> network is up too
[05:47] <LinuxBenny> thats not working
[05:48] <nutterpc> 0_o
[05:48] <matti> Oh, he didn't seen that... damn ;] 
[05:48] <TonyKite> sweet!!  vsftpd is there
[05:48] <TonyKite> hot damn
[05:48] <TonyKite> got ftp working :)
[05:48] <linux_newbie2> I am having problems playing CDs in Ubuntu...system sounds play and sound from DVDs plays, but when I try to play a CD with CD player it looks like it is playing but no sound comes out of the speakers
[05:48] <ZeXr0> TonyKite sudo -s apt-cache search ftp
[05:48] <ZeXr0> okay
[05:48] <LinuxBenny> the program i need can only be accessed when ithe whole thing is loged into the root
[05:48] <nutterpc> LinuxBenny, that sounds a bit odd
[05:48] <nutterpc> sudo su allows you to run as root user
[05:48] <TonyKite> i'm surprised how tight ubuntu is
[05:49] <LinuxBenny> you could just give me the password for the root login to. Since it is my right as a PC owner, remember i own the PC not you ubuntu.
[05:49] <nutterpc> LinuxBenny, did you create a normal user account?
[05:49] <LinuxBenny> yes
[05:49] <nutterpc> for you to login with?
[05:50] <nutterpc> use that password
[05:50] <nutterpc> when you enter sudo su, and it asks for a password
[05:50] <TonyKite> last nub question :... service vsftpd restart = what in ubuntu ?
[05:50] <pally> where does .serverauth.4795 come from?
[05:50] <nutterpc> enter that one
[05:50] <LinuxBenny> i got that far i just need to access that kynaptic program.
[05:51] <matti> Can some not registered user open a query to me? I need to check, if /umode -E works ;] 
[05:51] <nutterpc> so Synaptic isn't running properly?
[05:51] <TonyKite> is there a "service" kinda program on ubuntU to restart apps easily?  like.. service vsftpd restart ?
[05:52] <siimo> nutterpc: same beeping comtinues with video card taken out too...
[05:52] <siimo> or is it meant to
[05:52] <Schalken> nutterpc, what makes you think there isn't a driver for SiS 661/741/760/761?
[05:52] <matti> TonyKite: I never saw such.... :< BTW, what is wrong with /etc/init.d? :)
[05:52] <nutterpc> Schalken, there might be, not sure tho
[05:52] <sas171> crimsun: ok, the moduls are unloaded and nvsound is loaded now, but i cant get teamspeak and et mixing... =(
[05:52] <nutterpc> siimo, try plugging in a different vid card
[05:52] <siimo> Schalken: i have a 760 and do NOT get it trust me
[05:53] <Schalken> nutterpc, still cant get opengl to work. i have the xserver-xorg-drvier-sis package installed
[05:53] <Schalken> simmo, what? why?
[05:53] <MorbidHunger> its a ct4749
[05:53] <LinuxBenny> yes the kynaptic program is not working at least it won't open for me.
[05:53] <siimo> it doesnt support openGL on linux
[05:53] <TonyKite> where does ubuntu start apps from ?  i'm used to /usr/local/etc/rc.d and 'service <app>'
[05:53] <siimo> which chip do you have exactly
[05:53] <Schalken> simmo, arghhh! curses!
[05:53] <nutterpc> LinuxBenny, something sounds like its not working somewhere
[05:54] <siimo> if u got a agp slot stick a card in there for opengl
[05:54] <nutterpc> another way to install programs LinuxBenny is via apt-get
[05:54] <nutterpc> from command prompt
[05:54] <matti> TonyKite: /etc/init.d/ probably.
[05:54] <linux_newbie2> can someone help me get audio CDs playing?
[05:54] <Schalken> simmo, lspci just says SiS 661/741/760/761 PCI/VGA Video Adapter
[05:54] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc: its a ct 4749
[05:54] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, rightyo
[05:54] <matti> TonyKite: Just ls this dir.
[05:54] <nutterpc> gimme a few minds MorbidHunger
[05:54] <MorbidHunger> alrighjt
[05:54] <MorbidHunger> im searching for linux drivers
[05:56] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, it sounds like it might be a PCI128 to me
[05:56] <Schalken> siimo, you saying theres no chance of onboard graphics using OpenGL so I should get an AGP graphics vard (my motherboard has an AGP slot)
[05:56] <Schalken> ?
[05:56] <sas171> crimsun: and whats worser, i cant hear sounds on teamspeak, only some strange noise inplace...
[05:56] <Schalken> card*
[05:56] <siimo> Schalken: yes if you have 760GX
[05:56] <MorbidHunger> thats not what it says on the card
[05:56] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, I know, just sounds like it
[05:56] <nutterpc> touch wood
[05:56] <nutterpc> lol
[05:56] <Schalken> siimo, i have "661/741/760/761" thats all i know
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> interesting
[05:57] <MorbidHunger> what should id o
[05:57] <siimo> Schalken: what motherboard?
[05:57] <Schalken> Gigabyte something....
[05:57] <Schalken> ill check the model
[05:57] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, checking something
[05:57] <Michael`123> matti, I am back. I unplugged the PATA drive, booted up, and this HP boot configuration thing came up. I've never seen it before...
[05:58] <Boelcke> Can anyone suggest how to set a particular partition as root? (Doing install of ubuntu to make a dualboot system.) It won't let me pick it!
[05:58] <Michael`123> matti, It said if you are running Unix, you need to press F10, I did, but I wasn't really sure that to do, so I exited, and the computer booted into WinXP
[05:58] <Schalken> my moethrboard is a GIGABYTE GA-8S661FXM-775 with a SiS 661FX chipset
[05:58] <matti> Michael`123: So, it boot up?
[05:58] <Soir> Boelcke: doing a normal install?
[05:58] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, can't find much on that card on alsa-project.org atm
[05:59] <matti> Michael`123: Hmm... HP?
[05:59] <Michael`123> matti, It didn't show GRUB, but I don't know what the whole HP thing was. Perhaps there is no MBR at all on sda?
[05:59] <MorbidHunger> bummer
[05:59] <Michael`123> matti, It is an HP computer, I just got it actually
[05:59] <matti> Michael`123: Try to open a query to me ;] 
[05:59] <Boelcke> Soir, I have XP installed in hda1 (ntfs).  Setup an ext3 in hda5, but it won't seem to see that I want that as root.
[05:59] <MorbidHunger> this is so pathetic
[05:59] <linux_newbie2> Boelcke: are you in the partition editor in the setup?
[05:59] <siimo> Schalken: i'd get a cheap nvidia card if i were you maybe 2nd hand off ebay if you dont want to spend too much
[06:00] <sas171> crimsun: hm... and i have no sound in totem (
[06:00] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2, yes, I am.
[06:00] <NF4> Hello I was wondiner if any was able to get lmsensors to work properly under nf4  amd64
[06:00] <MorbidHunger> maybe ill go buy a sound blaster audigy
[06:00] <linux_newbie2> Boelcke, select the partition and hit enter
[06:00] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, what modules have you tried loading so far to get sound running
[06:00] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2, yep, I'm there.
[06:00] <siimo> any brb i need to try putting this machines gfx card into the broken one like nutterpc suggested
[06:00] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: then go to the Mount As line and hit enter
[06:01] <Schalken> simmo, hmmm i was gonna buy a mate's ATI 9250 for $20 (AUD) but I couldnt find any linux drivers for it at the time
[06:01] <MorbidHunger> dont know
[06:01] <Hit3k> Hi I have a wireless connection and its set up but when I close "Network Settings" it doesnt save the configuration
[06:01] <siimo> Schalken: thats perfect.. drivers for it are built into xorg
[06:01] <siimo> anyway i have to leave
[06:01] <MorbidHunger> all i wanted to do was watch a dvd and play some music
[06:01] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2: There's a Use As, a Mount point, and Mount options.
[06:01] <nutterpc> the only other thing i can think of MorbidHunger is now trying stepping thru all the modules that you've tried loading
[06:01] <Schalken> simmo, well, it is a shame that he sold it to someone else :(
[06:01] <helpneeded> nutter i know your busy helping others if you get time whenever you get a chance im ready ... thanks
[06:02] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: what does it say next to mount point?
[06:02] <matti> Michael`123: Dude, alive?
[06:02] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc: its just stupid
[06:02] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2: I've got Use As=Ext3, MountPoint=/media/hda5
[06:02] <Michael`123> matti, Yes sir?
[06:02] <nutterpc> I asked u earlier what options it gave you ;)
[06:02] <Schalken> lol, im gonna see whats on offer on ebay
[06:02] <emptyshell> I have a 200 gig HD that was in my old p3. Is there a way to boy something that will let me use it via USB on my laptop?
[06:02] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: ok, select the mount point line and hit enter
[06:02] <MorbidHunger> emptyshell
[06:02] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! Yay.
[06:02] <Michael`123> matti, I sent you a message. What do you suggest I do now?
[06:02] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, as the saying goes, there's more than one way to skin a cat
[06:02] <MorbidHunger> yes
[06:02] <MorbidHunger> im not trying to skin a cat
[06:02] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: yeah, not exactly intuitive :)
[06:02] <matti> Michael`123: OK, the -E didn't work, damn.
[06:02] <MorbidHunger> just trying to watch a damn movie
[06:03] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2, thanks so much...
[06:03] <Michael`123> matti, what does -E do?
[06:03] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: glad I could help someone :)
[06:03] <nutterpc> eg MorbidHunger, I'm pretty sure we should be able to find a way somehow to get sound working
[06:03] <MorbidHunger> it should just work..
[06:03] <MorbidHunger> hold on
[06:03] <MorbidHunger> ill go grab a beer
[06:03] <linux_newbie2> can anyone help me get audio CDs playing? *please*
[06:03] <MorbidHunger> i dont feel like pissing people off here by ranting
[06:03] <MorbidHunger> linux_newbie2 i got that same prob
[06:04] <Boelcke> Hey, one more partitioning questino then:  I'm using a big FAT32 partition as my share-space -- should I mount that as /home?
[06:04] <nutterpc> helpneeded, what options did the livecd give you when you chucked it in
=== Michael`123 is now known as Technel
[06:04] <Boelcke> Um, my CD plays fine.  What's the issue?
[06:04] <linux_newbie2> MorbidHunger: only audio CDs or all audio for you?
[06:04] <linux_newbie2> The CD player appears to play the CD, but no sound comes out
[06:04] <MorbidHunger> all audio
[06:04] <MorbidHunger> i got the same symptoms
[06:04] <linux_newbie2> System sounds and DVD audio work fine for me
[06:04] <helpneeded> hung btewwn 40- 51% a few times so downloaded text based install

[06:04] <linux_newbie2> yeah
[06:04] <Schalken> boy i just love some of the pictures that come on video card boxes
[06:05] <User828> i a ubuntu newbie is there a fix for airport extreme yet?
[06:05] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, do you have the cd audio cable running from the cd drive to the soundcard?
[06:05] <helpneeded> i can reburn live cd if you want ?
[06:05] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2: When you double click on the little speaker (top right in gnome), are all your volumes turned up?
[06:05] <nutterpc> would be good helpneeded :)
[06:06] <helpneeded> or the text based instalkl is  in at the min
[06:06] <helpneeded> cool ...
[06:06] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: everything except PC speaker
[06:06] <nutterpc> helpneeded, rightyo
[06:06] <User828> is there a fix for airport extreme?
[06:06] <Boelcke> linux_newbie2: PCM seems to control my volume.
[06:07] <nutterpc> press the function key F2 to see what options it gives you helpneeded
[06:07] <User828> anyone please
[06:07] <linux_newbie2> Boelke: PCM and Master are at 80%

[06:09] <PyroticShadow> Any printer/Scanner Guru's here?
[06:09] <Schalken> whats the best way to find out of a graphics card comes with good, fully supported Linux drivers (for XORG)? I dont want to buy a card just to find out its about as unsupported as my onboard graphics.
[06:09] <TonyKite> holy shit.. ubuntu kicks freebsd's ass... my freebsd machine caps out at 1-2MB/sec with the network.. either the driver or something else is screwed.. with UBUNTU livecd... it easily jumped to 8MB/sec
[06:10] <TonyKite> going 11MB/sec now
[06:10] <TonyKite> freebsd *sux*.. the older 4.* rocked but the 5.* and 6.* suck
[06:10] <T`> hmm.. i'm loading the bcm43xx module.. but i see no logs.. just one saying some interrupt was hooked on ACPI
[06:10] <nutterpc> try seeing if ubuntu will load with the resolution lowered helpneeded, eg: try 640x480x16
[06:10] <T`> isn't it supposed to spit out more info?
[06:10] <Hit3k> Can anyone help me with my wireless problem my Network settings are saving when i configure the wireless network
[06:11] <PyroticShadow> <-- Attempting to get his 'scanner' to work, the printer, works, great.
[06:11] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, can you bring up a command prompt
[06:11] <MorbidHunger> yes sir
[06:11] <nutterpc> sudo su, enter ur password
[06:12] <nutterpc> and try running alsamixer
[06:12] <nutterpc> see if it loads
[06:12] <dewbie> ok
[06:12] <PyroticShadow> Annnnnnnnnnybody, know what their talking about when it comes to Scanners and Printers... annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnybody?
[06:12] <dewbie> anyone have any ideas on why I can't find make-jpkg
[06:12] <nutterpc> PyroticShadow, not sure dude, people are having fun atm here wit sound issues
[06:12] <dewbie> its NOT in the multiverse repository even thogh EVERYONE says it is
[06:12] <nutterpc> hehehe
[06:13] <PyroticShadow> nutterpc, Oh joy, Anything I can do?
[06:13] <Hit3k> Can anyone help me with my wireless problem my Network settings are saving when i configure the wireless network
[06:13] <PyroticShadow> nutterpc, I'm just on a simple fix, and can't figure it out...
[06:13] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: did it work?
[06:13] <PyroticShadow> hit3k, if they are saving, what's the problem? :-)
[06:13] <nutterpc> PyroticShadow, if there's a way u can help someone else out while you wait and see if someone can help you with yours, makes life easier
[06:13] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, yeah, i moved like near 60 gigs to unallocated drive
[06:13] <MorbidHunger> its up
[06:13] <dewbie> I can't install java without it
[06:14] <Hit3k> PyroMithrandir, I meant ARNT saving
[06:14] <dewbie> so Im screwed
[06:14] <Hit3k> er
[06:14] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, going to install linux later on today on that partition
[06:14] <Hit3k> PyroticShadow,*
[06:14] <nutterpc> someone in here may know about scanners and whatnot, but might be busy
[06:14] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: good
[06:14] <Hit3k> silly Tab key
[06:14] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, =), thanks
[06:14] <PyroticShadow> nutterpc, yea' I know how that is, but I also take into persepctive, sombody who is on Ubuntu for their first day, could probably know a hell of alot more, than I do, being on Ubuntu, goin on Month #2...
[06:14] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, rightyo, whats it saying for the soundcard
[06:14] <admiral_proFTW> Pyromithrandir:  what up
[06:14] <admiral_proFTW> Taru: np
[06:14] <Taru> admiral_proFTW, ^^

[06:15] <nutterpc> there we go
[06:15] <admiral_proFTW> Pyromithrandir:
[06:15] <nutterpc> :)
[06:15] <PyroticShadow> nutterpc, I was a "Windoze-aholic"...because I use to 'game' alot.. but you seem busy, I'll shush..
[06:15] <admiral_proFTW> Always idle on IRC
[06:15] <dewbie> :(
[06:15] <dave__> hello.  I'm having difficulty enabling s-video on a laptop... can anyone help me?
[06:15] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, check down the bottom, for the volume level on Master & PCM
[06:15] <nutterpc> what does it say
[06:16] <MorbidHunger> pcm is at 100
[06:16] <nutterpc> is it muted?
[06:16] <MorbidHunger> nope
[06:16] <Boelcke> Installing Ubuntu on a second PC -- how can I copy all the setup stuff I've done on the first?  What files should I copy over other than sources.list
[06:16] <nutterpc> what about the other options
[06:16] <nutterpc> what are they set to
[06:17] <Shadowline> Boelcke: the contents of your home directory...including any hidden files...
[06:17] <PyroticShadow> Boelcke, only learn more, by re-doing all the setup stuff you did on the first one, by doing it on the second one.. learning experince.. first hand, and second hand.. you might find more options on the second time around.. ;)
[06:17] <Schalken> Boelcke, most of the little setup stuff (like app settings) is stored in hidden directories in your home folder
[06:17] <admiral_proFTW> how many desktops do you guys use?
[06:17] <Schalken> i have 1
[06:17] <dewbie> all of them
[06:17] <Boelcke> PyroticShadow, I'm trying to make this simple and painless for my wife...
[06:17] <dewbie> :P
[06:18] <Schalken> plus one crappy old computer
[06:18] <admiral_proFTW> Schalken: just oneZ
[06:18] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, what are the other volume sliders set to?
[06:18] <admiral_proFTW> dewbie: i think you know what i meanz I have 4
[06:18] <Boelcke> Shadowline, Schalken, thanks...
[06:18] <PyroticShadow> Boelcke, how nice of you, ignore my comments, I' truely should re-name myself, SarcasmBot.. :)
[06:18] <PyroticShadow> Boeclke, But, Good-Luck anywho!
[06:18] <dewbie> of course

[06:19] <dave__> hello
[06:19] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, seems like its all setup correctly
[06:19] <NickGarvey> I spent a while getting this to work with someone earlier, and it did on the live cd, but I can't seem to get it working now
[06:19] <NickGarvey> my wireless card can scan and such, but it cannot connect to anything
[06:20] <NickGarvey> it shows up as eth1, but not wlan0, and when it showed up as wlan0 on the live cd, it worked
[06:20] <MorbidHunger> yup
[06:20] <NickGarvey> eth1 has never worked, it can only scan
[06:20] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc thats the confusing part
[06:20] <Schalken> say i have a gigabyte gfx card (which i dont) with an nvidia chipset, would drivers for that card be provided by gigabyte or nvidia?
[06:20] <PyroticShadow> NickGarvey, mine shows up as ath0, for my wireless.
[06:20] <NickGarvey> although
[06:20] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, indeed
[06:20] <PyroticShadow> Schalken, nVidia, most likely.
[06:20] <dewbie> my wireless is 1xevdo
[06:20] <dewbie> heh
[06:21] <dewbie> pppd
[06:21] <adicts> hey i am installing an nvidia driver and i was wondering what the difference is between linux IA32 and IA64 are, and which one i should use
[06:21] <MorbidHunger> nutterpc everything shows up fine, but im getting nothing
[06:21] <linux_newbie2> ubotu: !upgrade
[06:21] <ubotu> linux_newbie2: What? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[06:21] <dewbie> a pain but it works
[06:21] <Schalken> pyroticshadow, oh okay, thanks
[06:21] <linux_newbie2> !upgrade
[06:21] <ubotu> methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
[06:21] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, try seeing if you can get ssh installed, I can take a look if you'd like
[06:21] <dave__> does ubuntu use xorg or xfree86?
[06:21] <PyroticShadow> adicts, IA32, is for a 32Bit processor, Probably yours, and IA64, is for a 64 Bit processor..
[06:21] <MorbidHunger> it is installed
[06:21] <PyroticShadow> dave..........xorg
[06:21] <dewbie> xorg
[06:21] <Schalken> dave__, pleaple say corg
[06:21] <PyroticShadow> Schalken, no problem.
[06:21] <adicts> thanks alot pyrotic
[06:21] <Schalken> lol
[06:21] <corey> is there a better more customizabl email/tasks/calender suite then evolution?
[06:21] <Schalken> im always beaten
[06:21] <sas171> as I try to install lebesd0 it asks me to remove ubuntu-desktop, what should I do?
[06:21] <PyroticShadow> adicts, anytime.
[06:21] <dave__> thanks
[06:22] <nutterpc> hmms
[06:22] <PyroticShadow> dave__anytime
[06:22] <MorbidHunger> i dont know where its installed to
[06:22] <dewbie> still waiting for an answer to where I can find make-jpkg
[06:22] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, check in /init.d/ for any ssh related services
[06:22] <PyroMithrandir> admiral_proFTW, sup?
[06:22] <PyroticShadow> dewbie, I'd love to help you, but I have not the slightest inclination,of what in sam hell you are talking about.. :-)
[06:23] <MorbidHunger> bash: cd: /init.d: No such file or directory
[06:23] <dewbie> when I try the command
[06:23] <kholerabbi> how do I install deskbar on ubuntu 5.1 (and whats universe?)
[06:23] <dewbie> fakeroot make-jpkg jre-1_5_0_04-linux-i586.bin
[06:23] <nutterpc> MorbidHunger, try this: ls /etc/init.d/
[06:23] <admiral_proFTW> PyroMithrandir: your prom date was just her...after her prom. actually, go to kubuntuofftopic
[06:23] <dewbie> it says make-jpkg not found
[06:23] <PyroticShadow> dewbie, you trying to install Java?
[06:24] <dewbie> obviously its jre1_5_07
[06:24] <dewbie> yes
[06:24] <PyroticShadow> dewbie.. frusteration and smartass remarks, get no help.
[06:24] <PyroticShadow> !tell dewbie about java
[06:24] <MorbidHunger> says nothing about ssh
[06:24] <mrmoen> hello, im looking to install lighttpd or apache2 (worker) with php and mysql support. if anyone has some experience with this and knows a good way to do this please let me know...
[06:24] <nutterpc> hmm ok MorbidHunger
[06:25] <nutterpc> go into Synaptic, do a search for ssh and see if everything is installed
[06:25] <dewbie> thanks
[06:25] <PyroticShadow> dewbie, no problem, p.s., next time, patience is a virtue.
[06:25] <dewbie> except
[06:25] <IcemanV9> nickrud: heya, remember i asked about oracle + swap space a few days ago? problem solved. oracle installed in less than 5 minutes. no problem whatsoever when oracle is running while i multitasking. it was wicked! just thought to let you know. :D

[06:26] <LorandKA> need one help. can somebdy give me the url for that auto mounting script?
[06:26] <helpneeded> crashes later on
[06:26] <dewbie> !javadebs
[06:26] <ubotu> In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-java5-jre is in multiverse
[06:26] <LorandKA> i am using kubuntu
[06:26] <nutterpc> that doesn't sound right helpneeded 0_o
[06:27] <nutterpc> if its crashing during install
[06:27] <nutterpc> very odd
[06:27] <PyroticShadow> dave__, you on Ubuntu right now?.. or are you on Windoze?
[06:27] <LorandKA> please
[06:27] <dave__> ubuntu... not a dual boot laptop
[06:27] <T`> in all these ubuntu wiki's they show System | Administration | <BLAH>
[06:27] <T`> where is this??
[06:27] <T`> i use xfce
[06:27] <nutterpc> if a mate of mine with the same laptop was awake, I'd ask him to bring round his one, and I'd try running the ubuntu livecd over it
[06:27] <PyroticShadow> dave__, Ok, I use to know the command to check it... let me double look before I give you wrong directions.
[06:27] <T`> is there a way to get to those config tools?
[06:27] <admiral_proFTW> T: omg KDE is better
[06:28] <dewbie> than?
[06:28] <IcemanV9> dave__: lspci |grep -i vga
[06:28] <PyroticShadow> IcemanV9, Thanks.. :-)
[06:28] <helpneeded> i know it will read all of these files   starts to install and config ... but  at this point i usualy get to a certain pont and  i get whats in the post in th forum ....
[06:28] <MorbidHunger> about !paste
[06:28] <PyroticShadow> IcemanV9, I was googling.. and as soon as I was typing, I noticed you got to it quicker than I did... :-)
[06:28] <MorbidHunger> !paste
[06:28] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[06:29] <dewbie> so...
[06:29] <nutterpc> helpneeded, sounds like there *may* be another problem there
[06:29] <IcemanV9> PyroticShadow: heh. trying to help.
[06:29] <nutterpc> have u got any other livecds on hand at all?
[06:29] <dewbie> still can't find make-jpkg so Ill wait
[06:29] <PyroticShadow> IcemanV9, that makes two of us.. on the "TRYING" train.
[06:30] <helpneeded> yep teh rc candidate but it hangs
[06:30] <dave__> thanks...
[06:30] <IcemanV9> dave__: does it tell you what you have? ATI? nvidia? i810?
[06:30] <helpneeded> between 40- 5X%
[06:30] <nutterpc> helpneeded, what I could suggest is find another small livecd, and see if your laptop will run from that, if it does, then we know ubuntu has a problem, and have something to go by
[06:30] <IcemanV9> dave__: there are plenty of wiki's on those graphic cards
[06:31] <PyroticShadow> dewbie, installing Java is easier than downloading that...one second please...
[06:31] <dave__> ati mobility radeon u1
[06:31] <PyroticShadow> !Tell dave__ about ati
[06:31] <helpneeded> you meran install another live cd ?
[06:31] <dave__> do I need the proprietary driver or is the open source one good enough?

[06:33] <nutterpc> try fiddling round some more with the cli video options at boot from the livecd
[06:33] <dave__> I haven't used IRC in, probably eight or nine years... how do I see what was msged?

[06:44] <scotth> Hi, I'm having a problem getting my dell smartstep 100n configured to run the latest dapper live cd.  I get this strange error about no video bios modes for chosen depth.  Anyone have an idea on how to get it to run?
[06:44] <nutterpc> brb all, need a coffee
[06:44] <dave__> five or six different packages
[06:44] <dave__> how do I fix it?
[06:44] <NF4> dose any one use lmsensors
[06:44] <PyroticShadow> dave__ wish I could help you
[06:45] <PyroticShadow> L8R3z~ all
[06:45] <dave__> sol huh?  thanks anyway
[06:45] <dewbie> in the conf Ive changed everything to the correct resolution, however it won't use them, if its not using that conf which one is xorg using?
[06:45] <Schalken> scotth, at what point does it show this error?
[06:45] <mrmoen> if anyone is familiar with installing lighttpd on ubuntu i could use some help getting started
[06:45] <Rug> Anybody familiar with iptables & DSL?  I have 3 different firewalls, all setup the same but one of them only allows about 50% of the websites I check to work.
[06:45] <scotth> Schalken, trying to start the xserver... the blue screen of x not working shows me it
[06:46] <Schalken> scotth, can you get into a terminal?
[06:46] <dave__> I'm going to restart x and see if that helps... thanks for everything
[06:46] <scotth> Schalken, yup
[06:46] <james_xxx> i am trying to install a linksys wusb54g wireless adapter.... from forums i can tell that others have done it. would anyone in here have any clues?
[06:46] <NickGarvey> dave_: did you apt-get update and apt-get upgrade, and apt-get dist-upgrade
[06:46] <NickGarvey> james_xxx: whats not working
[06:47] <james_xxx> NickGarvey, nothing is working
[06:47] <dave__> not apt-get dist-upgrade, but I did get the other two... sad thing is apt-get update tells me to run apt-get update
[06:47] <NickGarvey> james_xxx: heh, any progress at all? have the drivers?
[06:47] <NickGarvey> dave__: haha yup, you have a bad repository
[06:47] <issaker> hey all
[06:47] <Schalken> scotth, try running 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' (without the quotes) from the terminal and pay attention to the video configuration part
[06:47] <scotth> Schalken, in fact I started an ssh server and I'm running ubiquity from this machine over ssh... kinda hoping the installed system will work with my lappy...
[06:47] <dewbie> actually there aren't even any monitor frequencies listed in the xorg.conf
[06:47] <dave__> so, what do I do?
[06:47] <NickGarvey> dave__: comment out ones that aren't legit for now
[06:47] <james_xxx> NickGarvey, i downloaded a driver that i think is the right one, but my install attempts have gone nowhere
[06:48] <NickGarvey> dave__: know how to edit /etc/apt/sources.list?
[06:48] <s|k> oooh
[06:48] <issaker> guys, when i upgrade from breezy to dapper, should i remove obsolete packages?
[06:48] <scotth> Schalken, yeah, been there and it still doesn't care no matter if I use i810 or vesa or what color depths I choose
[06:48] <NickGarvey> james_xxx: need ndiswrapper?
[06:48] <s|k> they released picasa for ubuntu
[06:48] <dave__> I can sudo gedit, but what do I put?
[06:48] <s|k> http://picasa.google.com/linux/download.html
[06:48] <issaker> obsolete packages anyone?
[06:48] <Madpilot> s|k, it's Picasa-thru-Wine-sort-of-for-Linux....
[06:48] <james_xxx> NickGarvey, i am trying to avoid ndiswrapper. my understanding is that there is a way to do this without it. but.... it is probably above my newbie head
[06:48] <s|k> Madpilot: I installed it, it found all my pictures
[06:49] <helpneeded> wonders if nutterpc is still here ?
[06:49] <NickGarvey> james_xxx: oh okie then
[06:49] <Xenguy> s|k: what is so special about picassa - I've never heard of it until today?
[06:49] <s|k> Madpilot: and, it works almost exactly like it did on windows
[06:49] <Madpilot> s|k, cool
[06:49] <NickGarvey> james_xxx: have any webpages on it that I could read and interpret for you?
[06:49] <james_xxx> NickGarvey, yes, lemme look them up again. brb
[06:49] <issaker> is it a good idea to remove obsolete packages after an upgrade?
[06:49] <s|k> uh oh
[06:49] <LorandKA> can somebody tell me where can i find htat script, that mounts automatically all the fat32 partitions?
[06:49] <s|k> it is finding all my icons
[06:49] <s|k> :(
[06:50] <s|k> oh noo
[06:50] <s|k> hehe
[06:50] <dave__> when you say a bad repository, do you mean the website I'm trying to download from?
[06:50] <andrejkw> Hmm
[06:50] <andrejkw> I got a prob
[06:50] <andrejkw> I installed mozilla-mplayer
[06:50] <NickGarvey> dave__: when you run apt-get update, it loads a list of the stuff on the websites listed in that file
[06:50] <Schalken> issaker, personally i would remove them, but it shouldnt make a difference
[06:50] <Some_Person> i just ran ScanModem
[06:50] <Some_Person> what driver do i use?
[06:50] <NickGarvey> dave__: but if one of those sites are bad, then the entire thing will complain
[06:50] <issaker> what are they anyways schalken?
[06:50] <andrejkw> But when I try to listen to examples of pronounciations on www.m-w.org
[06:50] <andrejkw> It never finishes, and cuts halway through
[06:50] <dave__> so comment out the site?
[06:51] <NickGarvey> andrejkw: but it starts?
[06:51] <Schalken> issaker, i dont know, just packages synaptic considers obsolete for dapper, i spose
[06:51] <NickGarvey> dave__: yeah, you know how to do that?
[06:51] <dave__> seems to be a pound sign
[06:51] <issaker> oh
[06:51] <NickGarvey>  yessir

[06:53] <andrejkw> Ok appearently, mplayer cuts on all wav's
[06:53] <NickGarvey> dave__: did you comment out the wine repository?
[06:53] <Schalken> max_, if you cant change the screen res in the settings (system -> prefs -> screen resolution), see if you can add it when you do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
[06:53] <NickGarvey> andrejkw: so its a mplayer thing?
[06:53] <NickGarvey> andrejkw: could try totem or something

[07:23] <Apostle^> a snake behind me hisses, what my damage could have been
[07:23] <GTroy> but I still can't install this program
[07:23] <frank__> GTroy: what are you trying to do exactly?
[07:24] <matheus>  HymnToLife, Im trying to ping localhost or 127.0.0.1 and stay stilled
[07:24] <Eleaf> hmm..
[07:24] <GTroy> install a program called xmms-infopipe
[07:24] <ronlybonly> What do you think, is it worthwhile to upgrade from Flight 7 to the Dapper Release Candidate?
[07:24] <GTroy> frank__, never mind, I found it in synaptic
[07:24] <Flannel> ronlybonly: it's just a normal upgrade, via package manager.  and, #ubuntu+1 for dapper
[07:25] <frank__> GTroy: that's what I was gonna say ;)
[07:25] <matheus> HymnToLife, the problem does after I run the pppoeconf tool
[07:25] <HymnToLife> matheus> is the lo interface up ?
[07:25] <rredd4> frank__ dapper-alternate-i386.iso  ?  using a p3 dell laptop
[07:25] <frank__> ronlybonly: just use synaptic to do an upgrade
[07:25] <frank__> rredd4: yeah. alternate is just the install CD
[07:26] <matheus> HymnToLife, I don't know... where can I see that?
[07:26] <rredd4> frank__  why don't they provide a 686 iso
[07:26] <HymnToLife> matheus> ipconfig
[07:26] <HymnToLife> does lo appear in the list ?
[07:26] <HymnToLife> ifconfig** sorry
[07:26] <ronlybonly> Flannel, I know it's a "normal" upgrade, but since I'm on dial-up, I need to borrow a friend's internet connection to download the iso, then to an upgrade from that.
[07:26] <frank__> rredd4: to limit the number of images I guess. you can install the 686 kernel after you install
[07:26] <matheus> HymnToLife, bash: ipconfig: command not found
[07:27] <Schalken> owuld anyone recommend a graphics card with linux drivers for usual desktop use and the occasional gaming?
[07:27] <Flannel> ronlybonly: heh, alright.  Ask in #ubuntu+1, they'll be able to give you specifics.
[07:27] <frank__> ronlybonly: oh... maybe you should wait until dapper is released then
[07:27] <HymnToLife> matheus> it's iFcongif, my mistake
[07:27] <ronlybonly> i was just wondering if it was worth the hassle or if i would be better off waiting for my shipit order to arrive.
[07:27] <rredd4> frank__  ok, thanks for your help!!
[07:27] <Flannel> Schalken: nvidia has released linux drivers, so... anything nvidia will be good.
[07:27] <HymnToLife> ifconfig* damn
[07:27] <frank__> rredd4: no problem
[07:27] <Flannel> ronlybonly: right, but this is a breezy support channel, ask in #ubuntu+1, they're dapper users/support.
[07:28] <ronlybonly> thanks
[07:28] <Schalken> Flannel: does it have to be an nvidia chipset (for eg, ona gigabyte card) or a full nvidia card?
[07:28] <matheus> HymnToLife, UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST
[07:28] <rredd4> dewbie  did you follow what frank__ said to me, upgrade to dapper, this will fix your problem
[07:28] <frank__> ronlybonly: From what I've heard shipit is far from instantaneous.  I'd wait until June 1st and use your friends connection to download the released version
[07:28] <rredd4> dewbie  did you follow what frank__ said to me, upgrade to dapper, this will fix your problem
[07:28] <Dewbie> whats the command to configure xorg again?
[07:29] <Flannel> Schalken: nvidia cards have nvidia chipsets.
[07:29] <Dewbie> not yet
[07:29] <ronlybonly> k.Flannel: Good to know. thanks, i'll check there.
[07:29] <rredd4> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:29] <Dewbie> Im going to do one thing at a time
[07:29] <vinboy> hi
[07:29] <HymnToLife> Dewbie> sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:29] <vinboy> where can I find my system bootup log file?
[07:29] <Dewbie> as java isn't all that important
[07:29] <Schalken> Flannel: yeah but will a gigabyte card with an nvidia chipset have the same good Linux driver support?
[07:29] <ronlybonly> frank_: that's probably what i'll end up doing.
[07:29] <Dewbie> sound and the correct resultion are...
[07:29] <Dewbie> thanks Hmn
[07:29] <Flannel> Schalken: erm, gigabyte card?
[07:30] <Schalken> Flannel: yeah
[07:30] <matheus> HymnToLife, ??
[07:30] <Schalken> you know
[07:30] <Schalken> www.giga-byte.com.au
[07:30] <HymnToLife> matheus> I don't really know then...
[07:30] <NickGarvey> how can I check what arch a file is?
[07:30] <NickGarvey> if firefox is 64 bit, then I can't use flash
[07:30] <HymnToLife> is everything working fine until you run pppoeconf ?
[07:31] <Flannel> Schalken: ah.  Well, if they use nvidia drivers, then yes.  If they use modified nvidia drivers, not necessarily.
[07:31] <matheus> HymnToLife, I usely use modem as router
[07:31] <Schalken> Flanne: hmm well I'll have to find out then
[07:31] <matheus> HymnToLife, And I change to brigde mode
[07:31] <harold> k
[07:32] <matheus> HymnToLife, the internet connection is ok
[07:32] <harold> Nice name.
[07:32] <dave__> how do I determine which version of xorg is installed?
[07:32] <matheus> HymnToLife, I change again to router mode
[07:32] <rredd4> frank__ will dapper fix my problem with screen resolution.  On my laptop, when I change from 1600 x 1200 to 1024 x 768 it makes the display not full screen
[07:33] <matheus> HymnToLife, now the ethernet not connecting in the boot time
[07:33] <ubuntu> hello everyone
[07:33] <harold> hi, ubuntu
[07:33] <rredd4> frank__  nv driver
[07:33] <matheus> HymnToLife, Im go to menu system, administration, net... to activate ethernet
[07:33] <frank__> rredd4: I don't know
[07:33] <ubuntu> excuse me, do you know about Shell programming
[07:33] <issaker> how do i reinstall grub? i repaired window's boot.ini, now the grub's boot thing just vanished
[07:34] <frank__> rredd4: did you try the nvidia driver?
[07:34] <matheus> HymnToLife, and now I can't access localhost or 127.0.0.1
[07:34] <harold> issaker, check out the ubuntu wiki
[07:34] <harold> there's a document in there.
[07:34] <issaker> ok
[07:34] <HymnToLife> and you can access it before actiating your eth ?
[07:34] <harold> I could find it for you, if you want?
[07:34] <rredd4> frank__  I tried the nv driver and vesa in dpkg-reconfigure
[07:34] <matheus> not too
[07:34] <issaker> thatd be very sweet of you
[07:34] <dave__> does breezy use xorg 6.8?
[07:34] <issaker> on top of not yelling RTFM
[07:34] <matheus> HymnToLife, no
[07:35] <harold> hhaha.
[07:35] <ubuntu> thanks harold
[07:35] <issaker> =D
[07:35] <harold> I'm not that kind of person :D
[07:35] <frank__> !tell rredd4 about nvidia
[07:35] <rredd4> ok, ty
[07:35] <HymnToLife> matheus> could you pastebin your /etc/hosts please ?
[07:35] <frank__> rredd4: you can try the proprietary nvidia driver too. I don't know if it will help
[07:35] <rredd4> ok

[07:38] <matheus> ok

[07:39] <TonyKite> installing rather
[07:39] <harold> Just type server when you first install
[07:39] <NoUse> !tell TonyKite about server
[07:39] <harold> and then internet
[07:40] <harold> press enter*
[07:40] <harold> Gosh. I'm horribly dislexic.
[07:40] <harold> ..
[07:40] <rredd4> matheus some people are running slow machines, and it crashes them when someone pastes a lot of info in here. Thats why it is more polite to use pastebin

[07:43] <rredd4> matheus  I did it one day, someone told me to, and I got booted
[07:43] <harold> I could kill his connection if I wanted to.
[07:43] <rredd4> matheus i was a newbie
[07:43] <matheus> rredd4, what is newbie ?
[07:43] <Flannel> TonyKite: you can specify server install with the desktop ISO
[07:44] <rredd4> matheus someone new to linux
[07:44] <harold> I'm somewhat knew to linux :/
[07:44] <harold> Like, 5 months.
[07:44] <Flannel> TonyKite: at the initial boot prompt, type "server" (this is on the text-mode install, erm, "alternate" if you're using dapper, onbreezy and previous it's default ISO)
[07:44] <harold> What I said ^.
[07:44] <matheus> HymnToLife, sorry... but I can't find where is pastebin... :/

[07:49] <matheus> HymnToLife, Ok! now I know... sorry
=== deus_ is now known as linux_newbie2
[07:49] <HymnToLife> the file seems to be OK though, I can't see where the problem is
[07:51] <matheus> HymnToLife, Im going to restart my computer....
[07:51] <matheus> HymnToLife, I will back... holdme
[07:51] <V3ro> Hi!
[07:52] <V3ro> If I have installed the manpages-es, SHould I have configurate it?
[07:55] <frank__> V3ro: I don't know. man pages are probably not widely translated though
[07:55] <ScurveyFrog> I'm having problems setting up my nvidia card in Ubuntu
[07:56] <ScurveyFrog>  it's an Nvidia Geforce4 440 Go
[07:56] <Olde> Damn.............just read Dapper Drake not to be released til July 1st
[07:56] <harold> Question: I want to run a remote desktop, but I'm behind a linksys router. Any idea on how to get past the passworded prtection provded by default on the router?
[07:56] <frank__> Olde: where did you see that?
[07:56] <ScurveyFrog> when I use the "nvidia" driver, I get colored bars on the last inch on the right of the screen
[07:56] <Flannel> Olde: correct, but you could try the release candidate, it's fairly stable.
[07:56] <Flannel> Erm, Olde, JUNE 1
[07:56] <Olde> google
[07:56] <ScurveyFrog> and a repeat of the top inch of the screen at the bottom of the screen
[07:56] <ScurveyFrog> I've tried using both Ubuntu and SUSE with the same results
[07:57] <matheus> HymmToLife, Im back!
[07:57] <ScurveyFrog> I've tried changing my ModeLine, using legacy drivers, and using "IgnoreEDID"
[07:57] <matheus> HymmToLife, look
[07:57] <ScurveyFrog>  this is the 64MB card and it's on a Dell Latitude c840
[07:57] <Olde> okay.. will try it
[07:57] <NoUse> harold I would use SSH port forwarding
[07:57] <matheus> HymmToLife, I restart the pc
[07:57] <ScurveyFrog> I had the same problem in Windows until I downgraded the driver to 53
[07:57] <harold> NoUse: how would I do that? I don't have a password for the router--it's my dads.,
[07:57] <ScurveyFrog> but I don't know how to compile an old driver in Linux, it doesn't like my kernel
[07:57] <matheus> HymmToLife, And before I turnon the eth
[07:58] <ScurveyFrog> any ideas?
[07:58] <matheus> HymmToLife, I try to ping localhost
[07:58] <NoUse> harold, if you don't have the password for the router, you are kinda out of luck
[07:58] <harold> I'll ask my dad, then. He's asleep right now.
[07:58] <matheus> HymmToLife, and... "connect: Network is unreachable"
[07:58] <Olde> bbl
[07:58] <NoUse> !tell harold about ssh
[07:58] <harold> Thanks.
[07:58] <d00by> how do I get more packages to show up in the package manager
[07:58] <d00by> i just installed
[07:58] <NoUse> harold read the links ubotu sent you, you'll need to forward TCP port 22 to your ubuntu PC
[07:59] <ScurveyFrog> you add sources to your /etc/apt/sources.list
[07:59] <matheus> HymmToLife, are you there?
[07:59] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: maybe find the same version of the driver that worked on windows for linux at nvidia.com and install the driver from that package maybe
[07:59] <ScurveyFrog> I've tried it, but I can't compile it
[07:59] <NoUse> harold then use SSH to tunnel ports so like connecting to port 5900 on the SSH client with go securely through the SSH connection and connect to the server port 5900
[07:59] <harold> Yea. I see.
[07:59] <TonyKite> can you have samba use 3 drives, and if the windows user is trying to store data on the share and it can't fit on the first drive, it'll try the second.. or the third ?
[08:00] <ScurveyFrog> does anyone know how to compile old drivers short of downgrading my system?
[08:00] <d00by> how do I get more packages to show up in the package manager
[08:00] <ScurveyFrog> dOOby: add more sources to /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:01] <ScurveyFrog> find them on google by searching "sources.list"
[08:01] <matheus> HymmToLife, hello man !
[08:01] <frank__> !tell d00by about sources
[08:01] <matheus> :)
[08:01] <frank__> d00by: ScurveyFrog: searching google for random sources is definitely not a good idea
[08:02] <eggzeck> !easysource
[08:02] <ubotu> For an easy to use custom sources.list creator, visit http://ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
[08:02] <ScurveyFrog> can anyone help with my nvidia problem?
[08:03] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: did you check the ubuntuforums?
[08:03] <ScurveyFrog> yes, nothing there
[08:03] <bigfoot1> how can i learn more about a partciluar package (in terminal)?
[08:03] <eggzeck> ubotu tell ScurveyFrog about nvidia
[08:03] <ScurveyFrog> I've searched forums and google for many hours before coming here
[08:04] <roryy> bigfoot1: apt-cache show package-name-goes-here
[08:04] <rredd4> eggzeck nice website
[08:05] <bigfoot1> roryy: thanks
[08:05] <bigfoot1> i tried taking a screenshot of a realplay file but it only takes a zoomed up part of it
[08:05] <bigfoot1> what's wrong?
[08:05] <bigfoot1> how can i take a pic of the screen?
[08:05] <bigfoot1> i tried using gnome-screenshot
[08:06] <rredd4> bigfoot1  look under system then take screenshot
[08:06] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: what was the version of nvidia drivers that did work well?
[08:07] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, sudo apt-get install ksnapshot
[08:07] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, then: killall gnome-panel
[08:07] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, it can even take shots of windows
[08:07] <bigfoot1> actually, i was wrong. the screenshot just gives a black/blank screen for the realplay window
[08:07] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: it was 53 point something
[08:07] <bigfoot1> rredd4: is that different from using gnome-screenshot (PrintScreen button)?
[08:08] <rredd4> ? not sure
[08:08] <ScurveyFrog> I want to try the 53.36 for linux, but I can't get it to install
[08:08] <chainlynx> hey, ubuntu noob here: I'm trying to run eclipse.  I can do so just fine from the command line both as admin and not; however, double clicking on the icon gives me this error: A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)
[08:08] <chainlynx> must be available in order to run Eclipse. No Java virtual machine
[08:08] <chainlynx> was found after searching the following locations:
[08:08] <chainlynx> /home/chainlynx/Desktop/eclipse/jre/bin/java
[08:08] <chainlynx> 'java' in your current PATH  What's wrong?
[08:08] <matheus> hello
[08:08] <rredd4> chainlynx please do not flood
[08:08] <bigfoot1> eggzeck: are you a kubuntu user?
[08:08] <chainlynx> sorry
[08:08] <NoUse> !tell chainlynx about eclipse
[08:09] <harold> !eclipse
[08:09] <ubotu> to install eclipse please see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EclipseIDE
[08:09] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-5336.html
[08:09] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, NO, I use only gnome or xfce, and that doesn't mean you can't use KDE progs
[08:09] <Schalken> Does anyone know whether a Gigabyte graphics card with an nVidia GPU requires an nVidia or Gigabyte driver?
[08:09] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: install build-essential, and source linux-source
[08:10] <frank__> use synaptic and do a remove completely on nvdia-glx
[08:10] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: I've been to this page many times, when I run the binary it tells me that I need the correct kernel-source. When I install the kernel-source and the nvidia-kernel-source and the nvidia-kernel-source-legacy, I still can't compile
[08:10] <bigfoot1> eggzeck: and it takes screenshots of stuff that gnome-screenshot and gimp can't aquire?
[08:10] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: did you install build-essential?
[08:10] <ScurveyFrog> let me see
[08:11] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, it's never given me any problems.
[08:11] <frank__> ScurveyFrog: make sure you do remove completely on nvdia-glx
[08:11] <roryy> usually on ubuntu you don't install any kernel-source* packages.  You probably *will* need linux-headers-$(arch)
[08:12] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: currently no, but I just reinstalled Ubuntu after trying to get it to work in SUSE, so I don't know if I did before. I will try it and get back to you in a minute
[08:12] <rredd4> frank__ i will be happy when dapper is on US sites, it would have been done by now!
[08:12] <bigfoot1> eggzeck:  you were able to take snapshots of stuff like realplayer screen?
[08:12] <frank__> rredd4: oh the image you mean.. yeah those don't get mirrored I think
[08:12] <rredd4> nope
[08:13] <eggzeck> bigfoot1, I don't use realplayer... It doesn't hurt to try ;)
[08:13] <rredd4> frank__ my sources.list will not be US either?
[08:14] <frank__> rredd4: your sources.list will be the country you choose in the install
[08:14] <rredd4> ok
[08:14] <rlaager> Those pop-ups in the GNOME panel. What package is responsible for drawing them? I need to file a bug.
[08:15] <Dewbie> I finally have a higher resolution
[08:15] <Dewbie> not the one native to this screen but higher none-the-less
[08:15] <frank__> rlaager: with azureus?
[08:15] <SpaceInvader> help
[08:15] <[Ex0r] > hello there guys
[08:15] <Madpilot> rlaager, file it against gnome-panel, it'll get sorted from there if needed
[08:16] <Dewbie> next thing sound
[08:16] <Dewbie> woohoo
[08:16] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: no luck, it still won't compile
[08:16] <[Ex0r] > I was looking to try out ubuntu, but had a few questions
[08:16] <bigfoot1> eggzeck: it doesn't do anything different from gimp or print-screen
[08:16] <HymnToLife> !justask
[08:16] <ubotu> - Ask your question and we'll try to answer it.
[08:16] <bigfoot1> it just gives me a blank screen
[08:16] <SpaceInvader> when install truecrypt for Ubuntu?
[08:17] <ScurveyFrog> the earliest one that I can get to compile is 71 point something, and it still has the same problem
[08:17] <[Ex0r] > Is there alot of hardware support for ubuntu?
[08:17] <frank__> Dewbie: sound in dapper has probably improved
[08:17] <d00by> is gambas the closest thign to visual basic ubuntu has?
[08:17] <ScurveyFrog> [ExOr] : yes, most hardware is well supported
[08:17] <[Ex0r] > alright, including onboard lan and sound ?
=== frank__ is now known as frank23
[08:18] <rredd4> frank__ is dapper somewhat stable now? I know that june 1 is the stable version...
[08:18] <bdmp> Can some one please help me with this. 2 months going and no solution... http://drupal.org/node/57522
[08:18] <bdmp> oops
[08:18] <bdmp> wrong channel
[08:18] <ScurveyFrog> rredd4: I personally have had no stability problems, nor have any of my friends
[08:18] <rredd4> ok
[08:19] <[Ex0r] > and another question i've got... how easy is it to install stuff on ubuntu? Does it have a package manager and etc ?
[08:19] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: do you have any more ideas?
[08:19] <Flannel> [Ex0r] : yeah, it uses apt.
[08:19] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , very easy
[08:19] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: what error did you get when you ran the nvidia installer?
[08:20] <[Ex0r] > ah, so it is similar to debian's apt-get tool ?
[08:20] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: it said that it can't find a kernel-source and that I should install one from rpm's
[08:20] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , it IS debians apt get tool , ubuntu is based on debain
[08:20] <ScurveyFrog> it allows me to specify a path
[08:20] <[Ex0r] > oooh, I see.
[08:20] <[Ex0r] > I am starting to like ubuntu more and more :)
[08:20] <ScurveyFrog> but I don't know what to put, if anything
[08:21] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: which kernel are you running?
[08:21] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: 386, 686?
[08:21] <ScurveyFrog> 2.6.15-23
[08:21] <ScurveyFrog> 686
[08:21] <[Ex0r] > i think im going to load it up in vmware and try it out before installing it
[08:21] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: install linux-source and linux-headers-686
[08:21] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: it was the same with 386
[08:21] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , ;)
[08:22] <rredd4> [Ex0r]   i was a sarge user, got tired of not being the latest software.  Ubuntu is better
[08:22] <RancidLM> hey all i installed the latest nvidia drivers from building it from the kernel source but every time afterboot i have to keep -reinstalling the drivers.. is thier a way to fix this?
[08:22] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: okay, will try
[08:22] <[Ex0r] > anyone of you know any software that can run windows software from within linux? I've got a couple games I wish to play.
[08:22] <[Ex0r] > rredd4- me too :)
[08:22] <Kr0ntab> sup people
[08:22] <Dewbie> lol
[08:22] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , cedega , and / or wine
[08:22] <Dewbie> windoze games in linux..
[08:22] <Dewbie> without direct x support..
[08:23] <rredd4> lol
[08:23] <imbrandon> cedega has dx9 support dreamless
[08:23] <imbrandon> err Dewbie
[08:23] <frank23> RancidLM: use synaptic to do a remove completely on nvidia-glx
[08:23] <[Ex0r] > imbrandon- does that work only for games?
[08:23] <rredd4> no
[08:23] <Dewbie> time to get those windoze loving companies to make us linux compatible software
[08:23] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: okay, I'm going to try again
[08:23] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , no, wel cedega is centered on games, wine is any windows app
[08:23] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: see ya in a few
[08:23] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: ok
[08:23] <Frogzoo> [Ex0r] : wine
[08:23] <[Ex0r] > and it runs them without problems ?
[08:23] <Dewbie> like pong <3
[08:24] <RancidLM> [Ex0r] : cedega or winex is what ur looking for  thiers tutorials on my site http://linux.strangegamer.com
[08:24] <imbrandon> [Ex0r] , for the most part yes [Ex0r]

[08:27] <imbrandon> heh
[08:28] <cya> Hello
[08:29] <cya> I am running into frequent Kernel Panics on my Dell Inspiron 3800 and was wondering if anyon here could decrypt a Kernel Panic message to tell me whether it's the result of a hardware failure or not.
[08:29] <Eleaf> hmm
[08:29] <cya> I have typed up the entire Kernel Panic display screen.
[08:29] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: okay, it started to build this time, so we've made progress, but it quit in the middle
[08:29] <kspath> !tell cya about paste
[08:29] <RancidLM> frank23: it has been removed and im still getting this problem
[08:30] <ScurveyFrog> frank_: I looked at the nvidia-install.log, and there was a whole slew of errors, and it ended up with "nvidia.ko failed to build!"
[08:30] <frank23> RancidLM: you need to reinstall at every reboot?
[08:30] <RancidLM> frank23: yup my x-says thiers a error and i have to keep re-compiling the driver
[08:31] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: not sure...  did it say it was missing something?
[08:31] <frank23> RancidLM: check in /etc/init.d/  if there is a script called nvidia or nvidia-glx or something like that
[08:31] <cya> I have posted my Kernel Panic output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14717  Can anyone help me with this issue?
[08:32] <frank23> cya:  when does that happen?
[08:32] <cya> frank23: When I use the laptop, it either freezes up, or during boot, it displays Kernel Panic.
[08:32] <RancidLM> frank23: ya nvidia-glx
[08:33] <dli> cya, using an ubuntu livecd ?
[08:33] <frank23> cya: not sure. either unstable hardware or buggy driver I'd say...
[08:33] <cya> frank23: Initially, I thought it was a hdd failure so I replaced the hdd but I am still encountering this problem and am afraid it might be another hardware failure.  The only problem is I do not know which hardware is at fault.
[08:33] <matheus> HymnToLife, are you there??
[08:33] <cya> dli: I tried both Breezy and Dapper full installs.
[08:33] <AlmtyBob> how can I zip every file in a directory into individual zips?
[08:33] <dli> cya, try an ubuntu livecd
[08:34] <AlmtyBob> like pkzip type zips
[08:34] <matheus> HymnToLife, hello
[08:34] <dli> cya, or try memtest86
[08:34] <cya> dli: You suggest I load up the LiveCD and run memtest?
[08:34] <frank23> RancidLM: you have to get rid of nvidia-glx.  since it came with the nvidia-glx package you can just remove it...  or try apt-get remove --purge nvdia-glx before
[08:34] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: I can't find any specific file that it's missing
[08:34] <dli> cya, yes
[08:34] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: maybe I can send you the nvidia-install.log, it's hard to make sense of
[08:35] <cya> dli: Ok, will do.
[08:35] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: I can look at it if you want...
[08:35] <cya> dli: I am a bit skeptical though because I did swap out the RAM too.
[08:35] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: how can I send it to you?
[08:35] <matheus> hello... who knows to I get eth start at boot time ?
[08:35] <Mysta> hey guys, is 6.06 not available on torrents??
[08:35] <disinterested_pe> ok, im installing firefox 1.5.0.3 browser ive got the files all listed in terminal does anyone know the next cmd?
[08:35] <dli> cya, just do it
[08:36] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: can you just paste it here? paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[08:36] <cya> dli: I was just wondering whether someone would be able to interpret the output and determine which specific hardware (motherboard, RAM, hdd, etc.) was at fault.
[08:36] <cya> dli: I am running Memtest86 atm.
[08:36] <dli> cya, leave it run for a while
[08:37] <RancidLM> frank23: groovie i removied it ill find out soon if it worked :)
[08:37] <cya> dli: Alright, thank you.  I am kind of hoping it is the RAM as it is easiest to replace in a notebook.
[08:37] <frank23> RancidLM: it will ;)
[08:37] <byrneseyeview> Mysta: Google sez http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/ubuntu/releases/dapper/?fl=u
[08:37] <rredd4> will serpentine burn iso's?
[08:37] <Frogzoo> matheus: if it's just eth0, you should just edit /etc/network/interfaces to match your network settings
[08:37] <Mysta> byrneseyeview: what'd you type to find it?
[08:37] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: okay, it's there under ScurveyFrog
[08:37] <dli> cya, memtest86 reported ram errors may be something else
[08:38] <byrneseyeview> dapper torrent ubuntu
[08:38] <laserline> How do I delete a file that is in multiple directories... i.e i want to delete all those stupid Thumbs.db in my Music folder that windows created
[08:38] <cya> dli: Can you elaborate on that?  I'm sorry, I have never used memtest86 before, although I have seen it on multiple occasions on install CD's.
[08:38] <crimsun> rredd4: no, but nautilus will.
[08:38] <RancidLM> frank23: Groovie Thanks!
[08:38] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: oh... I forgot
[08:38] <rredd4> crimsun is that a console app?
[08:38] <dli> cya, for example, a buggy mobo can give you ram errors also
[08:39] <Dewbie> ok onto sound
[08:39] <dli> cya, cpu overheating
[08:39] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: you need to install gcc-3.4  and  type  export CC=gcc-3.4  before running the installer
[08:39] <Dewbie> erm that can't be good
[08:39] <Dewbie> lol
[08:39] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: okay
[08:39] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: breezy, right?
[08:39] <crimsun> rredd4: no
[08:39] <Dewbie> anyone good at making sound work?
[08:40] <Rug> eat a lot of beans
[08:40] <Rug> oh, not that sound?
[08:40] <matheus> Frogzoo, thanks... Im goint to restart to see if take effect
[08:40] <crimsun> Dewbie: #ubuntu-sound-help
[08:40] <Dewbie> ahhh
[08:40] <ScurveyFrog> no, dapper
[08:40] <Frogzoo> mathieu: sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0 - same thing
[08:40] <cya> dli: What will memtest86 be able to tell me?
[08:40] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: does that make a difference?
[08:40] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: then I'm not sure. what compiler was the kernel compiled with in dapper?
[08:41] <Frogzoo> frank23: 3.4
[08:41] <cya> dli: Will it narrow down possibilities for hardware failure, or will it confirm suspicions regarding a hardware failure?
[08:41] <Frogzoo> frank23: sorry - dapper - not sure
[08:41] <dli> cya,  no, it reports ram errors
[08:41] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: I don't know either
[08:41] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: should I just try it anyway?
[08:42] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: yeah. try it
[08:42] <ScurveyFrog> okay
[08:42] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: the export CC=gcc-3.4 didn't work
[08:43] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: what did it say?
[08:43] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: command not found
[08:43] <disinterested_pe> im guessing no one knows the next cmd for installing firefox 1.5.0.3?
[08:43] <cya> dli: Thanks for your help, I will run this overnight then, seems like it will take some time.
[08:44] <Madpilot> disinterested_pe, best way to get FF1.5 is to wait four days, then update to Dapper when it's released
[08:44] <kspath> cat /proc/version  OR  strings /boot/* | grep gcc
[08:44] <dli> cya, also try another livecd, say, knoppix, gentoo,
[08:44] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: oops, nevermind, it worked. I'm just used to putting sudo in front of almost everything
[08:44] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: export CC=gcc-3.4       it's all in one line
[08:44] <kspath> ScurveyFrog: cat /proc/version  OR  strings /boot/* | grep gcc
[08:44] <disinterested_pe> madpilot ive already got all the files open in a terminal
[08:45] <disinterested_pe> i installed them from the desktop
[08:45] <cya> dli: I don't think I have run Ubuntu LiveCD long enough to encounter the problems I do run into after installing, but I take it that it would most likely occur in LiveCD also.
[08:45] <vinboy> hi
[08:45] <ScurveyFrog> kspath: it says gcc version 4.0.3
[08:45] <Kakurady> How can I run an executable file in a tarball?
[08:45] <cya> dli: I will take that suggestion too and obtain more LiveCD's to test in case Ubuntu isn't liking my system for some reason.
[08:45] <rredd4> crimsun synaptic says nautilus is installed, I don't see it in my menus
[08:45] <vinboy> wat is the difference between aptitude and apt-get?
[08:45] <disinterested_pe> but it didnt say anything about installing them
[08:46] <ScurveyFrog> kspath: frank23: is that what I should use?
[08:46] <Kakurady> Apt-get is a command-line utility.
[08:46] <crimsun> rredd4: that's because it's already running
[08:46] <Hit3k> anybody here good with wireless?
[08:47] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: the installer said you needed to use 4.0.3?  that is what is used by default
[08:47] <matheus> hello men!!!!
[08:47] <rredd4> !tell Hit3k about ndiswrapper
[08:47] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: that's the version that was listed when I typed cat /proc/version
[08:47] <matheus> who tells me about /etc/network/interfaces ?
[08:47] <Hit3k> rredd4, I dont need ndiswrapper I have it all set up but it wont connect or turn on my card
[08:48] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: it's very possible that the nvidia kernel module just doesn't build using gcc-4
[08:48] <disinterested_pe> madpilot u dont know what i should do next?
[08:48] <Frogzoo> matheus: guilty!
[08:48] <Madpilot> disinterested_pe, I don't even use Firefox, so I've no idea
[08:48] <disinterested_pe> the next cmd?
[08:48] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: should I try it with 3.4?
[08:48] <matheus> Frogzoo, very thanks!!!!!
[08:48] <disinterested_pe> ook ty
[08:48] <slycer> can i update my version of ubuntu?
[08:48] <Madpilot> disinterested_pe, seriously, wait four days
[08:48] <Frogzoo> matheus: yw enjoy
[08:48] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: I don't think it will work. you can try though
[08:48] <matheus> Frogzoo, I went to go insany.......
[08:48] <ScurveyFrog> okay, why not?
[08:48] <dli> slycer, yes, update your sources.list, and dist-upgrade
[08:48] <disinterested_pe> im not running dapper until i get the cd's
[08:49] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: see ya in a few
[08:49] <Frogzoo> matheus: lol
[08:50] <cya> slycer: If you have 5.10, you can use gksudo "update-manager -d"
[08:50] <slycer> now i'am installing some updates, from the update manager
[08:50] <matheus> Frogzoo, I had a problem becose run the pppoeconf tool, and I edit interfaces file and just remove the lines that pppoeconf add
[08:51] <CharlesE> I have a few questions, I know I should google these questions but I really dotn have the time. I want to know if you can mount network drives to folders my idea is to have a lamp server and share the folers for things such as /var/ftp /var/www  also i would like to know if the widescreen bug has been fixed if it has all 3 of my computers will be running ubuntu
[08:51] <cya> slycer: http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc#head-13e42de40d3e6a8ef0b94d9b8441b8466d449471
[08:51] <matheus> Frogzoo, and all it's beautifull now
[08:51] <Frogzoo> matheus: yes - pppoeconf is annoying
[08:51] <daniel1994> hallo
[08:51] <daniel1994> ich hab ne frage
[08:51] <Frogzoo> matheus: splendide
[08:51] <Frogzoo> !de
[08:51] <ubotu> Deutschsprachige Hilfe fuer Probleme mit Ubuntu, Kubuntu oder Edubuntu finden Sie in den Kanaelen #ubuntu-de, #kubuntu-de oder #edubuntu-de
[08:52] <matheus> Frogzoo, thanks... im going...
[08:52] <MistaED> CharlesE: widescreen bug? i'm running one with no probs
[08:52] <daniel1994> ich wollt fragen ob jemand einen convertert5 kent mit dem ich mp4 dateien ins 3gp umwandeln kann
[08:53] <kspath> !tell daniel1994 about de
[08:53] <CharlesE> MistaED, In the old version there was a bug that did not let you use widescreen even if xorg had it set I could never get it working on my laptop in widescreen :(
[08:53] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: didn't work
[08:53] <daniel1994> kann mir jemand die frage in deutsch beantwqorten
[08:53] <Frogzoo> CharlesE: take a look at samba or nfs
[08:53] <kspath> daniel1994: nein kein
[08:53] <daniel1994> ich muss dass wissen
[08:54] <daniel1994> weil ich will mir videos aufs handy machen
[08:54] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: it asked if I wanted to ignore the fact that it was a different compiler than what I made the kernel with, but it failed anyway
[08:54] <MistaED> CharlesE: that's odd, what video chip?
[08:54] <CharlesE> Frogzoo, I am already networked :) it was soo easy with ubuntu but I just want to know if you can mount the network folders to other folders
[08:54] <Frogzoo> daniel1994: -> #ubuntu-de
[08:54] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: I don't know. that driver came out January 26, 2004 and gcc-4 probably wasn't released then
[08:54] <kspath> daniel1994: /join #ubuntu-de
[08:54] <slycer> thanks
[08:54] <CharlesE> MistaED, It was a common problem at the time i beleive It was an intel video card and 14" monitor
[08:54] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: yeah
[08:55] <daniel1994> kann mir bitte jemand die frage in deutsch beantworten?
[08:55] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: do you think there's a way to get the current driver working?
[08:55] <kspath> daniel1994: /join #ubuntu-de
[08:55] <Madpilot> daniel1994, /join #ubuntu-de
[08:55] <daniel1994> ach egal ich frrag meine tante
[08:55] <CharlesE> MistaED, there were also lots of other problems on the operating system wtih incompatabilitys when i ran the dapper livecd those are fixed (but could nto select widescreen although i assume thats because i cant edit xorg.conf in livecd)
[08:56] <roryy> he'll ask his aunt? *puzzled*
[08:56] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: I would think so but I have no idea. Try to google for it but don't use ubuntu as a search term. just linux in general
[08:56] <Frogzoo> CharlesE: of course, but symlinks might be easier as well as faster
[08:56] <MistaED> CharlesE: oh fair enough this runs an nvidia card, although with the nv driver i could never get a widescreen res working
[08:56] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: I have, I've tried everything I can think of on google
[08:56] <dli> ScurveyFrog, what's the issue?
[08:57] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: does the latest nvidia driver on windows have the problem?
[08:57] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: the best I could come up with was a short forum discussion between two people having the same problem
[08:57] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: yes
[08:57] <MistaED> once nautilus/gnome vfs can mount network folders to the filesystem i'll be a happy man
[08:57] <frank23> ScurveyFrog: that might a sign of 'special' Dell hardware
[08:57] <rredd4> crimsun I figured it out, insert blank cd, right click on iso and select write to disc.   that was easy!
[08:57] <ScurveyFrog> dli: the problem is that with the current nvidia drivers, I get multicolored lines on the last inch on the right side of my screen
[08:58] <MistaED> if that's possible now, that would be awesome to know
[08:58] <ScurveyFrog> dli: and a repeat of the top inch of the screen on the bottom inch of the screen
[08:58] <rredd4> why is Nvidia such a pain in the ...
[08:58] <dli> ScurveyFrog, did you ever try the newest binary driver, "NV*.run", from nvidia.com ?
[08:58] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: I know, I hate Dell, but unfortunately I need to work with what I've got
[08:58] <ScurveyFrog> dli: where do I get that?
[08:59] <cya> http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html
[08:59] <dli> ScurveyFrog, the current version should be, 1.0.8762
[09:00] <dli> ScurveyFrog, you need the package: linux-headers for your kernel version, sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[09:00] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I've tried installing it from Synaptic, would it turn out different running it from the site?
[09:00] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I have that file
[09:00] <dli> ScurveyFrog, do what I said
[09:00] <ScurveyFrog> dli: the linux-headers file
[09:00] <dli> ScurveyFrog, that's a package, not just a file
[09:00] <cya> ScurveyFrog: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074&highlight=nvidia+latest Use Method 2
[09:01] <ScurveyFrog> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-'uname -r'
[09:01] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I know, I just got it off synaptic
[09:01] <cya> ScurveyFrog: http://www.albertomilone.eu/europeo/latest_nvidia_dapper.html if you are on Dapper.
[09:02] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I just tried it again and it said I have it

=== HellDragon` is now known as HellDragon`sleep
[09:02] <cya> ScurveyFrog: Try following one of those guides depending on which version of Ubuntu you are running.
[09:03] <cya> ScurveyFrog: Method 2 is what you should follow for latest drivers.
[09:03] <dli> cya, whatever the version, get linux-headers, and try the binary from nvidia.com
[09:03] <Dewbie> which is better vesa or vga?
[09:03] <Dewbie> as a driver
[09:04] <ScurveyFrog> cya: okay, I think I've been through this one before, but I'll try it again
[09:04] <cya> dli: I just pointed him to some how-to guides that were posted for appropriate versions of Ubuntu.  They includes steps that instruct to download headers.
[09:04] <cya> ScurveyFrog: You are sure it's not a monitor issue?
[09:05] <dli> cya, ubuntu should try to support all hardware, but recommend intel video cards
[09:05] <matheus> Im back!!! :)

[09:07] <cya> dli: Thanks again for the help.

[09:26] <matheus> encompass, in ubuntu, mandrake my card dont record... I try suse live-cd and it works... maybe is the driver
[09:27] <encompass> well, ubuntu has newer drivers
[09:27] <encompass> it may be just a default setting somewhere
[09:27] <encompass> the other thing is to check if you get anything at all... liek with audacity

[09:32] <johannes__> when someone is offering to send me a file in msn it crashes. HELP!
[09:32] <l__> pez,  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[09:32] <dli> johannes__, if you just want file transferring in msn, use gaim
[09:33] <matheus> tuskernini, in the sip provider that I use, I can success only in kphone (for make calls only), and xten all works
[09:33] <Dewbie> use gaim
[09:33] <Dewbie> msn for linux is like not good
[09:33] <johannes__> dli i want to chat and sometimes file transfers
[09:33] <tuskernini> python -V
[09:33] <johannes__> dli i did exactly that
[09:33] <dli> johannes__, don't expect any support here, when you choose kopete 0.12
[09:33] <matheus> tuskernini, but I don't like the xten appearence
[09:33] <Dewbie> lol
[09:33] <Dewbie> wait
[09:33] <dli> johannes__, for chatting, can you try ekiga ?
[09:34] <matheus> tuskernini, ekiga have i good nice look
[09:34] <tuskernini> matheus, have you used ekiga.net and did it work fine?
[09:34] <johannes__> dli 1. is ekiga better 2. no support because kopete is kde?
[09:34] <dli> johannes__, or, use ekiga for chatting, and gaim for files
[09:34] <dli> johannes__, you can run gnome programs in kde, and vice versa
[09:35] <matheus> tuskernini, I use a sip provider in brazil becose I get better price for calls here
[09:35] <johannes__> dli i know kopete is stylisher and has more features anyway thx
[09:35] <dli> johannes__, ekiga can do voice/video chatting

[09:38] <[Yatta] > morning, anyone here have lirc running on them machine??
[09:38] <dli> johannes__, you can run skype in ubuntu
[09:39] <[Yatta] > i'm trying to free up com1 so lirc_serial can use it

[09:39] <[Yatta] > i've edited /var/lib/setserial/autoserial.conf to no avail
[09:39] <matheus> tuskernini, no works (sip provider for call to phone)
[09:39] <johannes__> does ekiga cost something? i mean the calls
[09:39] <johannes__> dli
[09:39] <matheus> johannes__, only pc-to-phone
[09:40] <Flannel> ekiga IS gnomemeeting.
[09:40] <Flannel> and, yes, you can use it to NetMeeting, because they both use the same protocols (it's standardized, so any compliant client can talk to ekiga)

[09:41] <berto-> hi everyone.  does anyone know about the debian/ubuntu build system?  how do these projects automatically build the distro from source?
[09:42] <Flannel> berto-: what?
[09:42] <matheus> tuskernini, could not connect... my provider is realy bad....
[09:42] <ScurveyFrog> frank23: I finally finished the walkthrough that cya sent me to, and it didn't change anything
[09:42] <Flannel> berto-: which projects are you talking about?
[09:42] <dli> ScurveyFrog, you downloaded the .run from nvidia.com ?
[09:42] <matheus> tuskernini, I only get success in linux using xten
[09:42] <ScurveyFrog> dli: yes
[09:43] <disinterested_pe> i cant get my webcam to work
[09:43] <berto-> flannel: i'm sure someone isn't behind a keyboard constantly building all packages from newly developed source.  there must be a build system grabbing sources from a repository and building the distribution.
[09:43] <dli> ScurveyFrog, and it runs correctly?
[09:43] <ScurveyFrog> dli: yes
[09:43] <ScurveyFrog> dli: no errors
[09:43] <berto-> flannel: so i'm looking for more information on the build system that automates this process.
[09:43] <Flannel> berto-: oh, you mean as X's new version gets released, packaging it into a deb?
[09:43] <dli> ScurveyFrog, and " rmmod nvidia && modprobe nvidia" ?
[09:44] <Flannel> berto-: erm, where X is some random program
[09:44] <ScurveyFrog> dli: ERROR: Module nvidia is in use
[09:44] <berto-> flannel: right.
[09:44] <tuskernini> matheus, what is your provider adress?
[09:44] <l__> how do you change the root passwd in ubuntu?
[09:44] <matheus> tuskernini, vono.net.br
[09:44] <monsterb> Hi - Can anyone recommend a good news reader - rss ??
[09:44] <Flannel> !tell l__ about root
[09:45] <berto-> flannel: but, not just for one package, but for the entire distro.  some machine somewhere is constantly building packages when new source is found.
[09:45] <protocol2> how do I tell if my video card is installed correctly in ubuntu?
[09:45] <KenSentMe> monsterb: i use akkregator
[09:45] <disinterested_pe> monsterb you should no news is good news
[09:46] <ScurveyFrog> dli: any ideas?
[09:46] <stjepan> how to install enlightement in ubuntu?
[09:46] <Flannel> berto-: no, I believe it's not done en masse, but rather by each package maintainer.  This page might give you some pertinant information: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperResources
[09:46] <monsterb> thx
[09:47] <dli> ScurveyFrog, you have to quit X, and do that
[09:47] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay
[09:47] <tuskernini> matheus, look here: http://gpfreitas.com/tmp/Ekiga-Vono.html
[09:47] <Quintok> stjepan: sudo apt-get install enlightenment should do it.
[09:48] <matheus> tuskernini, cool....
[09:48] <stjepan> Quintok, there's no package "enlighement"
[09:48] <matheus> tuskernini, I go to use ekiga now
[09:48] <Flannel> stjepan: you need to add universe
[09:48] <tuskernini> matheus, looks like you should remove a audio codec...
[09:48] <tuskernini> my brazilian is not so good... :-)
[09:49] <matheus> tuskernini, ?
[09:49] <matheus> tuskernini, is portuguese
[09:49] <tuskernini> matheus, in brazil its brazilian... in portugal its portu... i know..
[09:50] <matheus> tuskernini, the language that we speak
[09:50] <tuskernini> i know its the same lang... have lots of port.. freinds
[09:50] <stjepan> Flannel, I did
[09:50] <Flannel> stjepan: then enlightenment is there
[09:50] <tuskernini> matheus, but i also know that it is pronounced way diffirente
[09:50] <matheus> tuskernini, yes... it is
[09:51] <tuskernini> non fala portugesh
[09:51] <tuskernini> matheus, now go and figure out ekiga... strongs
[09:52] <Quintok> stjepan: make sure you do an apt-get update
[09:52] <matheus> tuskernini, first I need to install ekiga in my system
[09:52] <matheus> tuskernini, where can I get .deb package ?
[09:52] <stjepan> Quintok, I did
[09:53] <ScurveyFrog> dli: it told me that the module doesn't exist
[09:53] <Quintok> stjepan: well I may not be certain it's in the universe but I can see it right here, only other possibility is the multiverse.
[09:53] <stjepan> here's my sources list: http://pastebin.com/740786
[09:54] <dli> ScurveyFrog, that's why, you messed up
[09:54] <Flannel> Quintok: it's in universe, I just checked.
[09:54] <matheus> ubuntu 5.10 is breezy or dapper ?
[09:54] <Bilford> bb
[09:54] <johannes__> who has an idea about the macbooks and ubuntu? would that work? i didnt get brighter by looking for that in the web
[09:54] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I'll go through the steps again, but I'm confident I did them right
[09:55] <Flannel> Oh.  Dapper.  stjepan, it might be named something differently in dapper.  This is a breezy support channel.   #ubuntu+1 for dapper help.
[09:55] <dli> ScurveyFrog, okay, you are right
[09:55] <stjepan> Quintok, if I try to install enlightenment via apt-get, it says nothing. If I try to install it via synaptic, it says: http://pastebin.com/740788
[09:55] <ScurveyFrog> dli: sorry, I didn't mean it like that
[09:55] <googler> anyone know where to get good documentation about postfix?
[09:55] <dli> johannes__, I remember macbook has some booting problem, don't know it's solved or not
[09:55] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I'll try again
[09:56] <KenSentMe> googler: postfix.org?
[09:56] <Flannel> stjepan: erm, and yeah.  It's still "enlightenment" (in universe) on dapper.  So, this should still work.
[09:56] <stjepan> Flannel, but I can't install it :(
[09:56] <johannes__> dli with dualboot or with only linux as installation
[09:56] <googler> thx KenSentMe
[09:56] <Quintok> stjepan: universe is commented out.
[09:56] <matheus> now I must go
[09:56] <matheus> good night for all
[09:56] <dli> johannes__, I mean grub doesn't load with macbook
[09:56] <KenSentMe> googler: you say you are a googler, but you can't use google for this?
[09:56] <tuskernini> matheus, i will have alook
[09:56] <Flannel> Quintok: no, that's universe security.  universe is a few lines up.
[09:57] <googler> :)
[09:57] <dli> johannes__, but macbook really sucks, if you have to money buy a decent thinkpad :)
[09:57] <Flannel> stjepan: It's most likely a packaging mistake.  Ask in #ubuntu+1, and file a bug at launchpad.
[09:57] <Quintok> flannel: lol, good eyes I have
[09:57] <googler> i didn't find something valued
[09:57] <stjepan> Quintok, ok, now I uncommented security-universe
[09:57] <johannes__> dli i read with the fedora it would work..you may be right its heavy but it looks nice
[09:57] <Quintok> stjepan: shouldn't make a difference... I'll post my sources.
[09:57] <stjepan> btw, is it safe to use security universe?
[09:57] <tuskernini> get ekiga here http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=5&path=ubuntu/breezy_i386
[09:57] <dli> johannes__, thinkpad looks better, and it supports linux better
[09:58] <Flannel> stjepan: why wouldn't it be?
[09:58] <stjepan> ok, tnx
[09:58] <Quintok> stjepan: http://pastebin.com/740793
[09:59] <stjepan> tnx
[09:59] <johannes__> dli what do you think about the sony vaios with dualcore? i know they are not so strong (material) but nice features
[09:59] <dli> johannes__, don't touch sony
[09:59] <dli> johannes__, if you want a japanese one, try fujitsu
[09:59] <stjepan> Quintok, omg, you're mixing dapper and breezy repositories ?!
[09:59] <Flannel> Quintok, stjepan, it's a packaging mistake if thats the error you get.  Ask in #ubuntu+1, and check/file at launchpad.
[09:59] <protocol2> is there a way to gets specs of my system via console?
[10:00] <johannes__> ok dli but why?did you have one?
[10:00] <stjepan> Flannel, ok,tnx
[10:00] <dli> johannes__, sony looks good, and that's all, and it's doesn't support linux well
[10:00] <dli> johannes__, no, but I have seen a few broken ones
=== dreamthief is now known as dreamthief|away
[10:00] <Quintok> stjepan: that's only for freecontrib

[10:02] <berto-> flannel: thanks.
[10:02] <Flannel> johannes__: ubuntu wiki has a laptop page, if you want to check specific models.

[10:10] <ScurveyFrog> dli: in step 7 on method two, it says to go to point 13, but there is no point 13
[10:11] <crazy_penguin> morning all!
[10:11] <dli> ScurveyFrog, for testing, check your kernel version: uname -a ; check your linux-headers version: ls -l /usr/src ; download the .run file from nvidia.com ; run it
[10:12] <dli> ScurveyFrog, and " rmmod nvidia && modprobe nvidia "
[10:12] <ScurveyFrog> dli: uname -a gives me  2.6.15-23-686
[10:13] <ScurveyFrog> dli:  linux-headers-2.6.15-23-686
[10:16] <Naxo> hello goomorning at all
[10:16] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I still get the error
[10:16] <Quintok> ScurveyFrog: did you stop gdm before you attempted to install the nvidia driver? (./nvidia-installer bit)
[10:16] <SurfnKid> hi
[10:17] <ScurveyFrog> Quintok: yes I did
[10:17] <SurfnKid> does anyone have a Truemobile 1300 Wifi card on Ubuntu
[10:17] <ScurveyFrog> dli: ERROR: Module nvidia does not exist in /proc/modules
[10:17] <SurfnKid> Im a newb :)

[10:18] <ScurveyFrog> dli: returns nothing
[10:18] <farous> anyone remember how to report the fps with glxgears
[10:18] <Quintok> ScurveyFrog: I'm pretty sure it doesn't say anything
[10:18] <dli> ScurveyFrog, " rmmod nvidia ; lsmod |grep nvidia "
[10:18] <ScurveyFrog> Quintok: I didn't use ./nvidia-installer bit, I used sudo sh followed by the .run file
[10:19] <ScurveyFrog> dli: do I need to stop gdm first?
[10:19] <dli> farous, glxgears -printfps
[10:19] <SurfnKid> maybe i need to look in the forums
[10:19] <ScurveyFrog> before the rmmod?
[10:19] <dli> ScurveyFrog, yes, stop X

[10:25] <SurfnKid> but Fedora Core didnt do the trick
[10:25] <T`> grr.. no one knows sudo enough :(
[10:26] <dli> ScurveyFrog, " modprobe nvidia "
[10:26] <T`> SurfnKid, what trick?

[10:26] <ScurveyFrog> dli: again an empty response
[10:26] <dli> ScurveyFrog, lsmod | grep nvidia
[10:27] <roryy> T`: read 'man fstab' -- there is a 'user' option which can be used.  See, e.g., the cdrom or floppy entries in /etc/fstab
[10:27] <SurfnKid> I need to get off thinking microsoftly
[10:27] <ScurveyFrog> dli: nvidia               4553044  12

[10:27] <Dewbie> aka WYSIWYG editors
[10:28] <SurfnKid> i used dreamweaver
[10:28] <dli> ScurveyFrog, for testing only, " X -configure ", you may have to edit /root/xorg.conf.new after this command
[10:28] <T`> roryy, but its not in fstab..
[10:28] <Dewbie> I need it linux based
[10:28] <SurfnKid> oops
[10:28] <SurfnKid> i forget we're onlinux world
[10:28] <Dewbie> and free
[10:28] <tmroland> bluefish,nvu,screem
[10:28] <T`> roryy, i am talking about the user using "mount /dev/blah localdir'
[10:28] <T`> roryy, without sudo
[10:28] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay, what am I looking for?
[10:28] <dli> ScurveyFrog, you have to change " /dev/mouse " to " /dev/input/mice "
[10:28] <Dewbie> screem is html
[10:28] <tmroland> bluefish,nvu
[10:29] <ScurveyFrog> dli: using X-configure?
[10:29] <dli> ScurveyFrog, first, " X -configure "
[10:29] <dli> ScurveyFrog, you add sudo when needed
[10:30] <ScurveyFrog> dli: X-configure: command not found
[10:30] <dli> ScurveyFrog, copy my command
[10:30] <scoopex> where can i find qdesigner/kdevelop for ubuntu/kubuntu ? the package repositories doesn`t seem to contain i.e. a package named kdevelop....
[10:30] <SurfnKid> hey T thanks for th ehelp
[10:30] <SurfnKid> im gonna crash ill figure this out tomorrow
[10:30] <papillo1> Hi guys, I just instaled with synaptic the 686-smp packages to take the advantages of my PIV with HT, but the systems freezes after 3-5 minutes of running. Someone with my problem too?
[10:30] <roryy> T`: sorry, i'm not familiar with configuring sudo.  assuming you don't trust your users enough to give them 'sudo' rights anyway, i'm not sure you should allow them to do arbitrary mounting anyway.
[10:30] <Quintok> ScurveyFrog: to run X -configure you'll need to stop X
[10:31] <ScurveyFrog> Quintok: okay
[10:31] <T`> roryy, hmm.. well may be i should say they should be able to mount a few devices without perms
[10:32] <stjepan> anyone here uses engage?
[10:33] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay, I did that
[10:33] <ScurveyFrog> dli: no change
[10:33] <dli> ScurveyFrog, edit the file /root/xorg.conf.new
[10:34] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay
[10:34] <tmroland> ubuntu is so nice.. running on my powermac g5.. 2cpu and smp kernel :)
[10:34] <tmroland> too fast
[10:35] <ScurveyFrog> dli: that's weird, that file isn't there even though it told me it was creating it
[10:36] <ScurveyFrog> dli: I'm editing it, should it be empty?
[10:36] <mekanzoo> Hello... how do I make application auto start on boot?
[10:37] <dli> ScurveyFrog, no, it's an xorg.conf file
[10:37] <ScurveyFrog> dli: that's what I thought, it's not there at all
[10:37] <ScurveyFrog> dli: let me try again
[10:37] <dli> mekanzoo, Menu: System -> preferences -> sessions
[10:39] <ScurveyFrog> dli: it put it in my home directory
[10:39] <dli> ScurveyFrog, I c, my fault
[10:40] <dli> ScurveyFrog, edit it, replace /dev/mouse with /dev/input/mice
[10:40] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay
[10:40] <ScurveyFrog> dli: done
[10:41] <dli> ScurveyFrog,  then, test it, " X -config /path/to/xorg.conf.new "
[10:41] <ryle> how can I make a program run on startup?
[10:41] <ScurveyFrog> dli: do I need to leave X?
[10:41] <dli> ryle, Menu: System -> preferences -> sessions
[10:42] <kahuuna> ubuntu is beautiful, I love you guys
[10:42] <dli> ScurveyFrog, yes
[10:42] <ryle> dli: is there an actual config file located somewhere where these startup programs are stored?
[10:43] <mekanzoo> dli: thanks... but will it automatically start when I turn on the pc?
[10:43] <CharlesE> Does dual monitor support still have to be done thru xorg.conf or are there tools for this in dapper to do it
[10:43] <kekn> how?
[10:43] <dli> mekanzoo, no, that's for gnome sessions
[10:44] <dli> mekanzoo, for rc daemons, try, " System -> admin -> services "
[10:45] <shaun_> anyone there?
[10:45] <ScurveyFrog> dli: it brought me to a gray screen with an X for a cursor, and just sat there. It still had all the same graphical anomalies
[10:46] <Quintok> ScurveyFrog: was that using /etc/init.d/gdm start?
[10:46] <dli> ScurveyFrog, backup your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf , cp the new one over it, try to start gdm again
[10:46] <Dewbie> bluefish is more of what I was looking for thanks
[10:46] <shaun_> ANYONE CARE TO HELP A FRUSTRATED NUB WITH INSTALLING APACHE 2 ON UBUNTU?   TECHNICALLY ITS ALREADY INSTALLED. JUST DONT KNOW WHERE TO GO

[10:47] <ScurveyFrog> dli: okay, will do
[10:47] <shaun_> not screaming... trying to get attention
[10:47] <Quintok> by screaming.
[10:47] <shaun_> caps are too loud for you all?
[10:48] <dli> shaun_, because most people here are volunteers, so, the way you ask may well define how well you could receive help
[10:48] <Dewbie> do you give stray children in the grocery store attention when they scream?
[10:48] <Dewbie> buy them stuff
[10:48] <Dewbie> perhaps?
[10:48] <shaun_> lol,  once again.. not screaming.
[10:48] <gordonjcp> shaun_: most of us have scripts that filter out all-caps lines
[10:49] <ScurveyFrog> dli: everything is the same

[11:17] <triplah> i have all the repo's uncommented and i still can apt-get flashplayer or sun-j2re1.5

[11:17] <triplah> ok thanks
[11:17] <shaun_> protocol,   what is "it" that you are refering to,  #2.. how will I get used to it if I dont know what "It" is
[11:18] <Madpilot> triplah, for Flash & Sun Java: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[11:18] <Schalken> can anyone recommend to me a graphics card with linux support?
[11:18] <triplah> Madpilot: thanks
[11:18] <SurfnKid> wish i could help mate, sorry
[11:18] <Quintok> shaun_, pretty much to get anything done in ubuntu you need to use sudo.  protocol2 means that you'll get used to using it
[11:18] <Madpilot> triplah, and for an up to date sources.list, go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
[11:19] <protocol2> shaun, sudo is used in the terminal or console with a command making you root
[11:19] <Madpilot> shaun_, have you see the wiki's page on sudo?
[11:19] <l> can someone help me with this erro? http://pastebin.com/740843
[11:19] <shaun_> Madpilot: not yet.   i guess it might be comparable to Dos?
[11:19] <protocol2> another words you will need it to do a lot of administrative tasks
[11:19] <Madpilot> ubotu, tell shaun_ about sudo
[11:19] <triplah> Madpilot: great, thanks

[11:52] <IFlo> I tried the Ubuntu and Kubuntu Live CD (6.06 RC) and installed them. But in both i have after the install no connection to the internet. When I use the live CD I can surf in the internet.
[11:52] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, manners are strongly encourage in Ubuntu channels ;)
[11:53] <Madpilot> encouraged, even...
[11:53] <SurfnKid> coywolf, i installed debian last week, dam thing didnt do what i wanted it, sound didnt work initially...  now, ubuntu configured all the devices, now i just need to finish the wireless card and im done
[11:53] <kettenschutz> are u using a router @ IFLO ?!
[11:53] <SurfnKid> madpilot yeah :)
[11:53] <Quintok> I think it's important, many distro's can be very... "RTFM".
[11:53] <kettenschutz> mhh whatever, thx @ quintok :)
[11:53] <SurfnKid> thats why, all the efnet junkies are so bitter it sucks
[11:53] <IFlo> @kettenschutz yes. But i have no connection to it too
[11:53] <SurfnKid> oh well, their loss
[11:54] <kettenschutz> look @ your networksettings @q IFlo
[11:54] <coywolf> SurfnKid, how to move from debian to ubuntu?
[11:54] <SurfnKid> boot from the DVD
[11:54] <Quintok> coywolf, you need to download it and install it
[11:54] <SurfnKid> delete the linux partition, repartition
[11:54] <SurfnKid> install the whole thing
[11:54] <SurfnKid> whoala
[11:54] <kettenschutz> and put the ip in a manually way
[11:54] <SurfnKid> and im still running my WinXP on the sid
[11:54] <SurfnKid> e
[11:55] <IFlo> @ kettenschutz: I dont know what to do there...
[11:55] <coywolf> Quintok, can i upgrade my sid to it?
[11:55] <kettenschutz> ok u are using KDE or GNome?
[11:55] <SurfnKid> surprised everything is still in one piece, no mistakes or anything, im proud of myself for the first time
[11:55] <SurfnKid> ok anyway, back to this sudo issue.. grrrrr :@
[11:55] <SurfnKid> :P
[11:55] <IFlo> @ kettenschutz: I tried both
[11:55] <kettenschutz> IFlo, do u know which IP your router got?! normally 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1
[11:55] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, what howto are you following?
[11:56] <IFlo> 192.168.0.1
[11:56] <SurfnKid> oh madpilot
[11:56] <SurfnKid> i just remembered, after 2 sudo commands it did ask for pwd
[11:56] <kettenschutz> then give your networkcard the IP 192.168.0.2 or 0.3 ...0.4 ...
[11:56] <Quintok> coywolf, I would suggest you don't.  be smoother on the other end to start again
[11:56] <SurfnKid> um...  http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25683
[11:56] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, sudo remembers your password for a while, then times out
[11:56] <kettenschutz> but in KDE u have to click the administrationbutton @ the network settings first
[11:57] <SurfnKid> running the step 3. code
[11:57] <SurfnKid> ah i see
[11:57] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, that's an old howto - it's from Ubuntu 5.04, current is 5.10...
[11:57] <SurfnKid> crap
[11:58] <kettenschutz> IFlo, got i ?!
[11:58] <kettenschutz> **it
[11:58] <IFlo>  kettenschutz: ok, i try that later. (And it doesnt matter that i have no connection to my router)
[11:58] <IFlo> ?
[11:58] <SurfnKid> you know what i love about c-span
[11:58] <Madpilot> SurfnKid, do another search on your card type (or just on 'Broadcom') in ubuntuforums, there's likely a newer howto
[11:58] <SurfnKid> those who testify chew up the senators
[11:59] <kettenschutz> IFlo, the Problem is, u cant have an connection to your router if it cant find your card
[11:59] <kermitX_> best free entertainment on television? ;)
[11:59] <SurfnKid> ok i am
[11:59] <kettenschutz> sometimes the DHCP mode wont work "fine", so you have to manually configure your card
[11:59] <SurfnKid> there's probably an easier solution i can probably run myself
[11:59] <Madpilot> anyway, I need to get off this box. Have fun, everyone.
[11:59] <SurfnKid> kettenschutz, yes i had that problem dhcp didnt do anythin
[11:59] <SurfnKid> thanks for the help Mad
[12:00] <SurfnKid> manually set ip #
[12:00] <[lastnight] > anyone here use mutt on ubuntu?
[12:00] <SurfnKid> your butt
[12:00] <SurfnKid> :P
[12:01] <kettenschutz> IFlo, configure your networkcard for yourself at the IP: 192.168.0.2, then open a new terminal and type: ping 192.168.0.1, if your router "answers", all is good
[12:01] <IFlo> stange is that I have a connection to the internet when i run the liveCD. And when I use Fedora Core 5 I have a connection to the internet too
[12:01] <[lastnight] > any luck displaying messages in arabic (ubuntu , mutt)??
[12:01] <[lastnight] > i've been unable to do so
[12:01] <kettenschutz> maybe the DHCP support on the LiveDisc are even better (maybe newer ver.?)
[12:01] <kettenschutz> change ur ip and see what u've done :)
[12:02] <rati> can someone pls help me ?
[12:02] <[lastnight] > also, with postfix, how can you do smtp auth (doesnt seem to be any ideas in main config file)

[12:06] <rati> he didn't :S
[12:06] <rati> but the eggdrop didn't :S
[12:06] <[lastnight] > well then you configured it wrong
[12:06] <gordonjcp> rati: is anything listening on that port?
[12:06] <rati> gordonjcp the eggdrop joined mirc
[12:06] <[lastnight] > manymore, just drop your eggdrop on some cheap shell server
[12:06] <rati> but when i wanna join it's dcc

[12:09] <lotuspsychje> i got a problem too
[12:09] <Jeeves_Moss> gordonjcp:  one sec.  waiting for the system to come up
[12:09] <lotuspsychje> i want to change the mac adress on boot
[12:10] <gordonjcp> Jeeves_Moss: you know that dmesg will tell you the boot messages?
[12:10] <lotuspsychje> i can change it already with macchanger
[12:10] <lotuspsychje> but everytime i boot it gets my ip again
[12:10] <CokeNCode> W: Couldn't stat source package list http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy-backports/multiverse Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_multiverse_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)
[12:10] <Jeeves_Moss> gordonjcp:  I had shut down the virtual system thinking I was done with it, then I decided to check here.  one sec for the error.
[12:10] <lotuspsychje> so any way to bootup mac adress changing?
[12:11] <Jeeves_Moss> all: "package apache is not available, but is referred to by another package."
[12:11] <lotuspsychje> try apache2
[12:12] <Frogzoo> lotuspsychje: yes - define pre-up in /etc/network/interfaces
[12:12] <CokeNCode> damn errors ...
[12:12] <lotuspsychje> tnx frogzoo
[12:12] <Jeeves_Moss> lotuspsychje:  Is it easy to cluseter?  (I'm trying it on virtual systems to see if I can load balance it with out a reverse proxy.  I'd like to use something that is dynamicaly load balanced with out a controler)
[12:12] <[lastnight] > rati - sunni ?
[12:13] <lotuspsychje> Frogzoo: i can add the line ifconfig hw eth0 ...macadress?
[12:14] <enkrav> how can I play an audio cd saved as an iso image on disk?
[12:14] <speedsix> Hi, bit of an obscure probelm. I'm trying to get Mythfrontend to start on login, easy enough but I need it to start on my second monitor. I can get this to work by adding the command 'mythtfrontend -display :0.1' to the startup list. Problem is it seems maybe the overlay doesn't start in time and all I get in myth is a blue screen when I try to watch tv. If I close it and start it manually it's fine.

[12:18] <granden> I found this
[12:18] <granden> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/forum/server/apache2/SSL?highlight=%28apache%29
[12:18] <granden> Where is the cert signed?
[12:18] <granden> I want it to be signed by a third part
[12:18] <rekrutacja> please help i have problems with getting up wifi card 3CRSHPW196 (atmel)
[12:18] <Jeeves_Moss> granden:  thanks.  I'm looking for a way to load balance 2 seprate clusters.  That way I can provide failover protection.
[12:19] <granden> Jeeves_Moss: What?
[12:21] <Jeeves_Moss> granden: basicly taking 2 HTTP servers (dual NICs), the servers are clustered (2 servers per cluster, NIC1=cluster 1, NIC2=cluster2).  The diddern't NICs are on differen't switches.  The clusters are headless (the servers balance out dynamicly using a token) to take requests.  And the 2 differen't clusters are balanced as well.  That way, if a switch goes down, I still have a running cluster.
[12:21] <granden> I dont know
[12:21] <granden> How to do it, why asking me? :)
[12:22] <Jeeves_Moss> Granden:  no idea.  didden't know if you knew.
[12:22] <lotuspsychje> hmm how do i add a line to etc/network/interfaces?
[12:22] <granden> Jeeves_Moss: Ok :) Sorry I dont know I would like to accomplish that as well
[12:23] <rati> guys plssssssssssssss
[12:23] <rati> no one will help me ?
[12:23] <lotuspsychje> lol
[12:23] <rati> how can i open on the putty ssh the port 3623 for telnet :(
[12:23] <rati> pls anyone give me the command
[12:24] <Jeeves_Moss> granden:  when I find a way, I'll let you know.
[12:24] <lotuspsychje> ssh connects 23 right?
[12:24] <lotuspsychje> not sure if it can connect on other port rati
[12:24] <rati> lotuspsychje standard 22
[12:24] <Isaiah_the_Marty> how do you install realplayer if you dont have root?
[12:24] <lotuspsychje> oh
[12:25] <lotuspsychje> you must have root to install programs
[12:25] <rati> Isaiah_the_Marty i have root :S
[12:25] <lotuspsychje> lol
[12:25] <rati> lotuspsychje i have root on the server :S
[12:25] <rati> i just need to know how to open the telnet port
[12:25] <rati> to make my eggdrop works
[12:25] <lotuspsychje> telnet on server?
[12:25] <speedo_> g' day guys
[12:25] <Jeeves_Moss> granden: That set up ~should~ work for up to 8 servers per secondary cluster, and up to 32 main clusers (8 systems in smaller clusters).  Then depending on how you mix and match the cross overs from the NICs, you should be able to suffer >60% switch failure.
[12:25] <Abo> where can I find new fonts for ubuntu?

[12:35] <lotuspsychje> isaiah
[12:35] <lotuspsychje> did u set the rootpassword?
[12:35] <tubbie> T`, whats is a VM?
[12:35] <binks120> no games here thats for the xbox
[12:35] <lotuspsychje> in the first place?
[12:35] <T`> tubbie, www.vmware.com
[12:35] <tubbie> I don't use vmware
[12:35] <Isaiah_the_Marty> the first time i installed it asked me
[12:35] <lotuspsychje> no
[12:35] <tubbie> the P4 is more responsive
[12:36] <Chousuke> Isaiah_the_Marty: no it doesn't
[12:36] <lotuspsychje> first ubuntu shell session
[12:36] <Isaiah_the_Marty> then i installed redhat for a bit and formatted
[12:36] <lotuspsychje> u need to set the rootpassword
[12:36] <Chousuke> Isaiah_the_Marty: it asks for your own
[12:36] <Chousuke> !sudo
[12:36] <ubotu> from memory, sudo is a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[12:36] <tubbie> is vmware free?
[12:36] <binks120> no
[12:36] <T`> tubbie, yes
[12:36] <Chousuke> as in beer
[12:36] <binks120> well not free
[12:36] <Isaiah_the_Marty> it says password i type mine in and it just goes back to the command line
[12:36] <lotuspsychje> sudo passwd
[12:36] <T`> binks120, it is
[12:36] <Frogzoo> tubbie: consider kqemu
[12:36] <reiki> there is a free VMware product right now. It's a beta but it gets you in
[12:36] <Isaiah_the_Marty> but not as root
[12:37] <T`> binks120, vmplayer, vmserver
[12:37] <lotuspsychje> Isaiah: sudo passwd
[12:37] <Chousuke> ... no
[12:37] <T`> tubbie, vmplayer is pretty much the best hypervisor out there.. no doubts
[12:37] <Chousuke> lotuspsychje: that's not recommended. :/
[12:37] <lotuspsychje> why?
[12:37] <binks120> vmware isnt free
[12:37] <Chousuke> because you can use sudo
[12:37] <Isaiah_the_Marty> k
[12:37] <Isaiah_the_Marty> thanks lotuspsychje
[12:37] <reiki> VMWare workstation 5.5 is what I use and it was about $100(USD) with education discount (I work at a university)
[12:37] <Chousuke> ..
[12:37] <T`> binks120, dude i'm runnning 2 vmplayers now.. its free
[12:37] <lotuspsychje> well
[12:38] <binks120> wtf is vmplayer
[12:38] <lotuspsychje> if you got a good pass
[12:38] <reiki> vmware PLAYER is free
[12:38] <Chousuke> don't run "sudo passwd".
[12:38] <Isaiah_the_Marty> now its as root
[12:38] <binks120> he said vmware
[12:38] <T`> vmplayer does everything VM workstation does
[12:38] <T`> except snapshots
[12:38] <reiki> you want to CREATE VMs you can't do that with player
[12:38] <T`> reiki, are you kidding?
[12:38] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i want to get media working
[12:38] <exmethix> Hallo @ all!!! I need help! Could anybody of you tell me what this is? http://welt2.ameisenwelten.de/?ak=uw&pick=792
[12:38] <Chousuke> sudo passwd enables root login, which is not needed on Ubuntu
[12:38] <reiki> kidding about what?
[12:38] <T`> reiki, there are many tutorials all over the place showing how to do that
[12:38] <lotuspsychje> so?
[12:38] <T`> reiki, i just made a few VMs today :)
[12:38] <lotuspsychje> i will be asked for root pass when su
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> no sweat
[12:39] <Chousuke> lotuspsychje: so, if you don't have a good reason to enable root login, you shouldn't.
[12:39] <reiki> T' oh... ok you can cobble together a VM outside and then use it in player. I just found it a lot easier to just get Workstation
[12:39] <binks120> so is it pos to rum vmplayer and have osx x86 inside
[12:39] <T`> reiki, i think workstation is nice for pro users. who like snapshots, copy-on0write, etc..
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> why sould not?
[12:39] <Chousuke> because it's useless
[12:39] <T`> binks120, yup
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> its strong password
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> so
[12:39] <binks120> hmmmm well interesting
[12:39] <Chousuke> you could just as well use sudo
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> yes
[12:39] <T`> binks120, but you need a modded osX i think.. because they make sure osX doesn't run in any VM
[12:39] <lotuspsychje> and also su
[12:39] <T`> binks120, apple makes sure that is..
[12:40] <Chousuke> which is a more "ubuntu-like" way.
[12:40] <lotuspsychje> whatever a user likes
[12:40] <Isaiah_the_Marty> can someone help me with setting up media
[12:40] <KenSentMe> exmethix: please don't do that. It's spam
[12:40] <binks120> any links to a tut on osxx86 inside vwplayer inside ubuntu lol
[12:40] <T`> binks120, there are many torrents out there who can give you the iso for that ;0
[12:40] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i cant get music or video working
[12:40] <lotuspsychje> xmms, kafeine
[12:40] <lotuspsychje> realplayer
[12:40] <lotuspsychje> whatever u like
[12:40] <Chousuke> realplayer?!
[12:41] <Chousuke> please.
[12:41] <T`> binks120, vmplayer is really simple to install .. just download their tar.gz.. and run this perl script inside it.. you will need kernel-headers package beacuse it compiles some kernel modules (which are OSS, so no license tainting)
[12:41] <reiki> legitimate VMWare SERVER for free... from VMWare...
[12:41] <reiki> http://www.vmware.com/products/server/
[12:41] <T`> reiki, yup
[12:41] <T`> reiki, server i never used, but a friend is running it at his lab in my univ
[12:41] <T`> reiki, he said its really nice.. :)
[12:41] <lotuspsychje> Chousuke: not everyone is a linux hardass
[12:42] <lotuspsychje> and likes other stuff too
[12:42] <Chousuke> lotuspsychje: I'm not one either
[12:42] <reiki> T' it's a convenient way to see a lot of features. Not sure if you'd ever get updates beyond the beta though... which is why I bought Workstation
[12:42] <Chousuke> but realplayer isn't even good software :|
[12:42] <reiki> with academic ID it was inexpensive
[12:42] <lotuspsychje> i would not use it too
[12:42] <lotuspsychje> but some ppl will
[12:42] <ompaul> !tell Isaiah_the_Marty about restricted formats
[12:42] <T`> reiki, i would say vmware is worth the money.. they make such good innovative software.. haven't found any other cmpany which does such quality stuff
[12:42] <Isaiah_the_Marty> can someone help me with media problems?
[12:42] <ompaul> !tell Isaiah_the_Marty about restrictedformats
[12:42] <granden> Hi, I have apache2 running with ssl now. But I get to different web roots using ssl and none ssl
[12:42] <ompaul> !tell Isaiah_the_Marty about easyubuntu
[12:43] <binks120> what media prob do u have
[12:43] <T`> reiki, i have free workstation, but i use vmplayer because i dont like cluttered look ;)
[12:43] <granden> But I use the same vhost except I copied the non ssl and added SSLEngine ON
[12:43] <granden> Anyoneg
[12:43] <T`> reiki, they have free CDs to students at a job fair in our univ.. hhe
[12:43] <Bajek> is gtk1 use utf-8 fonts ?
[12:43] <ompaul> Isaiah_the_Marty, read the messages from the channel bot ubotu cheers
[12:43] <Isaiah_the_Marty> thanks mate
[12:43] <lotuspsychje> so anyone know howto add a line to etc/network/interfaces
[12:43] <reiki> T' I have ONE piece of software used for collecting and displaying data from a piece of medical equipment I use every night to ... basically stay alive.. only runs in windows. I don't like dual booting. VMWare was perfect for this AND it was able to use a USB connected smart card reader
[12:44] <binks120> can anyone tell me whats wrong here and how to fix
[12:44] <binks120> ./grtsh: error while loading shared libraries: libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[12:44] <binks120> does it need root
[12:44] <T`> binks120, you need to install some java libs
[12:44] <binks120> i installed java from repos
[12:44] <Frogzoo> reiki: are you saying a windows crash will kill you?
[12:44] <T`> reiki, hehe yea.. i also love their USB hot plug.. its so awesome
[12:44] <reiki> T' so... it was worth it to me. And they just sent me mail about free virtualization "kit" and I wonder if it has a free workstation CD :)
[12:45] <T`> reiki, i had this scanner whcih had no linux drivers. so i used to use it in windows VM ;)
[12:45] <reiki> Frogzoo, no... I'm saying not having this medical equipment *could* kill me. The windows program just lets me read the data and make adjustments to the machine by reprogramming the smart card
[12:46] <Abo> anyone have installed subclipse on ubuntu?
[12:46] <T`> oh damn.. what kind of medical equipment is that!?
[12:46] <squiddle> Abo  yes
[12:46] <Frogzoo> reiki: ah, well that's rather different ;)
[12:46] <binks120> http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=595559&messageID=3146104
[12:46] <binks120> how do i do do this
[12:46] <Bajek> is gtk1 use utf-8 fonts ?
[12:47] <Abo> squiddle, can you tell me how to get javaHL and set it up?
[12:47] <Bajek> is gtk1 uses utf-8 fonts ?
[12:47] <rati> CAN ANYONE HELP ME AND TELL ME HOW DO I OPEN A TELNET PORT ON THE SERVER FROM MY ROOT ?
[12:47] <rati> CAN ANYONE HELP ME AND TELL ME HOW DO I OPEN A TELNET PORT ON THE SERVER FROM MY ROOT ?
[12:47] <rati> CAN ANYONE HELP ME AND TELL ME HOW DO I OPEN A TELNET PORT ON THE SERVER FROM MY ROOT ?
[12:47] <T`> binks120, have you googled on where you can get that library? its really simple to fix.. just find the package name and install.. thats it
[12:47] <rati> CAN ANYONE HELP ME AND TELL ME HOW DO I OPEN A TELNET PORT ON THE SERVER FROM MY ROOT ?
[12:47] <Frogzoo> rati: j!!!! bad rati
[12:47] <reiki> T' it's really kind of a lot more common than you'd think. It pressurizes my airway to keep me breathing. Otherwise, when I sleep, my airway closes and I stop  breathing
[12:47] <T`> rati, shut up.. dont flood
[12:47] <Hobbsee> rati: stop repeating.
[12:47] <reiki> always remember... breathing is your FRIEND! :)
[12:47] <binks120> rati dont shout
[12:47] <rati> am asking
[12:47] <rati> from 1 hour
[12:47] <rati> and no one help me
[12:47] <Hobbsee> rati: telnet address.of.telnet port#
[12:47] <Frogzoo> rati: I'm guessing there's no op about - usually you get kicked for that behaviour
[12:47] <rati> always sarcasm no more
[12:48] <reiki> rati, flooding won't get you an answer.. it will only get you kicked
[12:48] <Hobbsee> Frogzoo: i was being lenient - the next time it happens...
[12:48] <T`> reiki, ooh.. i knw someone who uses such a machine.. but i think its because he doesn;t breath enough oxygen while sleeping, so he feels tired in the morning
[12:48] <T`> reiki, so the machine i think puts more oxygen or something like that into the air he breathes..
[12:48] <rati> reiki then can u pls help me n tell me how ? all ports are closed i have root and i wanna open a telnet port on the server so i can login to it on telnet :S
[12:48] <lotuspsychje> how can i edit etc/network/interfaces??
[12:48] <Hobbsee> rati: telnet address.of.telnet port#
[12:49] <Isaiah_the_Marty> why is there a need for so many distibutions of linux if its free?
=== kefkouille is now known as gourdin
[12:49] <T`> rati, you have to install a telnet server
[12:49] <reiki> T' similar... when you stop breathing your oxygen saturation goes way down. ... probably should end this though as it's way off topic :)
=== l is now known as l__
[12:49] <T`> rati, telnetd
[12:49] <Isaiah_the_Marty> and how do the programmers who make linux get payed?
[12:49] <Hobbsee> Isaiah_the_Marty: ask that in #ubuntu-offtopic
[12:49] <T`> reiki, hehe ok
[12:49] <rati> Hobbsee but this is how i join to the port and ip ? but the port i already closed :S i wanna make a port so i can join it
[12:49] <Isaiah_the_Marty> meh
[12:49] <kayde> howw do i autommaticly add or remove program?
[12:49] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, its a matter of choice
[12:49] <Hobbsee> rati: you were told - a telnet server...
[12:49] <kayde> what the auto detect for ubuntu?
[12:49] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, you have 10k free items.. you can pick 1k of them to make a good distro
[12:50] <Hobbsee> Isaiah_the_Marty: some are emplyed by various companies, some are in the summer of code, etc
[12:50] <reiki> kayde: have you looked in Synaptic?
[12:50] <kayde> what the auto detect for ubuntu?
[12:50] <ryle> does anyone know where I can find the config file for keyboard shortcuts under gnome?
[12:50] <Isaiah_the_Marty> but how do all the distributors pay for it
[12:50] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, so everyone picks their own
[12:50] <squiddle> Abo  i don't recall exactly, ha dno problems i will look in my eclipse preferences. where exactly is your problem?
[12:50] <kayde> reiki, ?? what is that?
[12:50] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, pay what? software is free
[12:50] <Hobbsee> T`: hosting isnt though.
[12:50] <Hobbsee> !offtopic
[12:50] <ubotu> Non Ubuntu support related discussions may be carried out in the channel #ubuntu-offtopic. Editor/Language wars are welcome there!
[12:50] <reiki> kayde: System -> Administration -> synaptic package manager
[12:50] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i mean everything
[12:51] <gholen> How do i change a interface name, exemple, rausb0 to wlan0?
[12:51] <Frogzoo> rati: you need an entry in /etc/inetd.conf  - but really telnet is most ill advised - use sshd
[12:51] <kayde> reiki, thanks man, found it :)
[12:51] <reiki> np
[12:51] <Isaiah_the_Marty> the programmers who code ubuntu , companies, tech , shipping cost
[12:51] <Hobbsee> gholen: ifconfig?
[12:51] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, generally hosting is not that expensive, and the distro is distributed by free mirrors
[12:51] <kayde> reiki, im off ty
[12:51] <Isaiah_the_Marty> how is it payed for
[12:51] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, some distro maintainers take donations to cover expenses
[12:51] <reiki> glad to help... goodness know I've RECEIVED enough help here. Bout time I gave back SOMETHING :)
[12:51] <Isaiah_the_Marty> oh
[12:51] <Draconicus> If I upgrade from a 32bit system to a 64bit system, will I need to reinstall Ubuntu completely, or can I just change the kernel once I've booted the system?
[12:51] <Hobbsee> Isaiah_the_Marty: they're mostly unpaid.  see wiki.ubuntu.com/sabdfl
[12:51] <Isaiah_the_Marty> i had the cd's sent
[12:51] <T`> Isaiah_the_Marty, some distros are big companies which provide support for people who use their distro.. so they get lots of money that way
[12:52] <trpr42> Isaiah_the_Marty: #ubuntu-offtopic man.. companies selling various distros sell support services. corporate customers want a complete package which is what they try to provide
[12:52] <gholen> Hobbsee: Well, I want the alias set to wlan, but I dont know if that is done by ifconfig
[12:53] <rati> T` there is already a telnet server i just wanna open a port to join the telnet
[12:53] <Isaiah_the_Marty> alright thanks
[12:53] <Hobbsee> gholen: hmmm okay - not sure
[12:53] <Frogzoo> gholen: afaik - the name is embedded in the driver so you can't change the name
[12:53] <T`> rati, thats not called "opening" a port
[12:53] <T`> rati, thats called connecting to a port
[12:54] <T`> rati, or telnetting
[12:54] <T`> rati, telnet <host> <port>
[12:54] <rati> T` when u wanna connect to a port means the port is OPENED already
[12:54] <rati> i can't :S
[12:54] <T`> rati, why not?
[12:54] <rati> why no one is understanding me ?
[12:54] <rati> there is NO telnet port opened
[12:54] <rati> all closed
[12:54] <T`> because you dont make yourself understanable?
[12:54] <rati> i just wanna open one
[12:54] <Isaiah_the_Marty> god its so pretty
[12:54] <T`> you just said its open
[12:54] <rati> am not professional !
[12:54] <rati> noooooooooo
[12:54] <rati> it's not opened
[12:54] <Frogzoo> rati: you need an entry in /etc/inetd.conf  - but really telnet is most ill advised - use sshd    (it would help if you read previous replies)
[12:54] <Isaiah_the_Marty> my panties are wet
[12:55] <rati> i wanna open one
[12:55] <T`> rati, ok.. basically you run a telnet server.. which binds to a socket and listens for you to connect.. when you connect it will let you see the login shell
[12:55] <rati> Frogzoo man i am on sssh :S and from sshd the root i just wanna open the port 6323 so i can join it
[12:55] <Blippe> rati, the ports are opened, you just don't seem to have something listening on your computer on your opened ports

[12:58] <Techno_2> I've recently compiled a vanilla kernel, and added it to my grub list, but when it begins to load it says it cannout mount the root partition (I'm sure I've got it right) and that there is an unkown block (0,0). What does this problem mean?
[12:58] <trpr42> protocol2: you said it first ;)
[12:58] <Blippe> and you are able to connect to it normally?
[12:58] <protocol2> ok just trying to remember
[12:58] <skuttler> hi, i am using dapper and can't find where to put my WPA passphrase - anyone know
[12:58] <rati> Blippe yes to port 6667 it's joining
[12:58] <rati> but i wanna open another port :S
[12:58] <rati> when i put the ip
[12:58] <rati> and port 6667
[12:58] <rati> the telnet joins normal
[12:58] <rati> but i wanna join another port
[12:59] <Frogzoo> skuttler: dapper's in #ubuntu+1
[12:59] <Blippe> rati, do you have a firewall on the machine?
[12:59] <skuttler> cheers
[01:00] <rati> Blippe yes
[01:00] <rati> but the bot joined
[01:00] <rati> so it isn't from the firewall
[01:00] <rati> i just need to open a good port
[01:00] <rati> so i can join telnet
[01:02] <squiddle> OT omg http://radio.indymedia.org/news/2006/05/9797.php
[01:03] <Blippe> rati, you see, what people was arguing to you about was sematics, if your firewall is blocking a port, it is closed, if it is not, it is open, but an opened port doesn't have to have something listening on it. So if your telnet server/deamon is not configured to listen to the port, it doesn't matter if it is opened or not. If you want help to open a port, you're asking for help with your firewall, if you want help configuring telnet, you d
[01:03] <Blippe> on't want help to open a port
[01:04] <speedsix> I don't suppose anyone knows how to make the Adlib emulation in ubuntu use a particular alsa plugin (i.e spdif?)
[01:05] <Blippe> rati you still want help to open a port, or help configuring your telnet-deamon?

[01:09] <ubotu> sudo is, like, totally, a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.

[01:36] <andrejkw> Hiya guys
[01:38] <andrejkw> Why doesn't mozplugger associate itself with wav files in FireFox? When I do "about:plugins", everything else shows up except WAV. There is however a WAV entry in /etc/mozpluggerrc.
[01:40] <crazy_penguin> ompaul: did you look at the small movie clip with nelson mandela explaining the various aspects of ubuntu concept in the example package?
[01:41] <andrejkw> Can someone please help? This is driving me nuts.
[01:42] <ompaul> crazy_penguin, no -- I am about to power up the notebook and its all your fault ;-)
[01:42] <crazy_penguin> why?
[01:42] <crazy_penguin> what did i do?
[01:43] <andrejkw> Why doesn't mozplugger associate itself with wav files in FireFox? When I do "about:plugins", everything else shows up except WAV. There is however a WAV entry in /etc/mozpluggerrc.

[01:43] <crazy_penguin> sorry
[01:43] <ompaul> crazy_penguin, it is not a bad thing
[01:43] <Hexidigital> is anyone (running 2 different machines) notice a delay with certain packages in the updates?  (not a support issue, everything works... just curiosity)
[01:43] <ompaul> crazy_penguin, mind if I message you?
[01:43] <crazy_penguin> no
[01:43] <crazy_penguin> go ahead
[01:43] <bzerodi> btw, can that clip be had from somewhere on the net
[01:43] <bzerodi> ?
[01:44] <crazy_penguin> bzerodi: that was for me?
[01:44] <bzerodi> yes
[01:45] <crazy_penguin> it's in the example package installed by ubuntu
[01:47] <bzerodi> crazy_penguin: would that be 'example-content' ? If so, I don't see the movie on http://foodfight.org/movies/Ubuntu%20Fanpeople/

[01:50] <Jude> Anyone have any idea how to fix a broken mysql installation?
[01:50] <bzerodi> crazy_penguin: I'm using dapper. I looked on packages.ubuntu.com and apparently the package isn't in dapper (yet?)
[01:50] <crazy_penguin> bzerodi: and yes the package's name is example-content

[01:54] <Hexidigital_> hehe... everytime they update the ubuntu-artwork package, my OpenOffice icon on my toolbar changes... and i am confused...
[01:54] <Hexidigital_> ompaul:: do you know if bcm43xx is supported for dapper only, or breezy also?
[01:54] <picur> egy krds!
[01:54] <ompaul> Hexidigital_, I know nothing ;-) [no idea] 
[01:55] <andrejkw> Hexidigital_: use ndiswrapper

[01:55] <Hexidigital_> :) ok... i may have found a bug
[01:55] <Hexidigital_> no
[01:55] <strapal> igen
[01:55] <Hexidigital_> it works, andrejkw
[01:55] <Hexidigital_> i figured it out
[01:55] <Jude> Also, hoary != breezy. Anyway, thanks for that, ompaul. :)
[01:55] <ompaul> Jude, that command should work on both
[01:56] <ompaul> Jude, in fact that command should work on debian and ubuntu any version
[01:56] <Jude> ompaul: :D! I was just pointing out my mistake. I can never remember what I'm currently using.

[01:57] <Draconicus> Can somebody here help me with NFS?
[01:57] <ompaul> !nfs
[01:57] <ubotu> rumour has it, nfs is see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NFSClientHowTo and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NFSServerHowTo for information on installing and configuring NFS.
[01:58] <ompaul> Draconicus, I guess ^^^ might help you ;-)
[01:59] <pianoboy3333> Can anyone here help me with configuring X? I need the protocol "evdev" for my mouse, yet X complains it can't find it.
[02:00] <arcade> Draconicus: What exactly do you need help with, with NFS?
[02:00] <arcade> Draconicus: if it's something difficult, ask.  If it's just regular "how do I set up blahdiblah", refer to google and howtos ;)
[02:00] <pianoboy3333> !evdev
[02:00] <ubotu> Syntax error in line 1. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, pianoboy3333
[02:01] <bakaa> yo
[02:01] <Jude> ompaul: Thanks for your help... looks like that didn't do the trick, though. It won't stop the server... bha. Oh well, guess I'll just format and try again :)
[02:01] <ompaul> Jude, do this
[02:01] <ompaul> Jude, sudo /etc/init.d/my(tab) stop
[02:01] <Draconicus> arcade: Alright. Here's a question the wiki can't immediately answer: Is NFS fairly quick and simple to set up for somebody experienced with things like Samba?
[02:02] <ompaul> Jude, you asked how to remove so I took it that you had it stopped ;-)
[02:02] <Jude> ompaul: Well, it said it had stopped :)
[02:02] <Jude> ompaul: And there is apparently nothing my-related in init.d. Ack.
[02:02] <ompaul> Draconicus, did you read the server set up page?
[02:02] <arcade> Draconicus: Well, the terminology is different - but yes.
[02:02] <Hexidigital_> have a good day everybody...
[02:02] <Draconicus> ompaul: I'm reading it now.
[02:03] <arcade> Draconicus: Personally I find samba horribly difficult and filled with pitfalls, while NFS is quick'n simple
[02:03] <ompaul> Jude,  reboot and check it out, get dapper in 5 days and be much happier ;-)
[02:03] <Draconicus> arcade: I can set up samba in three minutes or less. What about NFS?
[02:03] <Jude> But then I'll loose my uptime! :( (What uptime? :D)
[02:04] <Jude> Is dapper in five days? I haven't been keeping track.
[02:04] <arcade> Draconicus: I can set up NFS in about 20 seconds ("vi /etc/exports ; /etc/init.d/nfs.server start")
[02:04] <Jude> I have every intention of just formatting a spare PC and installing dapper on that, so I guess I'll wait until then :)
[02:04] <arcade> .. or whatever the 'start' command is in ubuntu :D
[02:04] <Draconicus> arcade: Eww. You use vim? :P
[02:04] <arcade> Draconicus: Of course. :)
[02:04] <prxq> kernel-source is at 2.6.15.7-ubuntu1, while the installed kernel is 2.6.15-23. What gives?
[02:05] <samuel_> what is the latest version of gnome and how do i update ubuntu to it and is it stable
[02:05] <arcade> Draconicus: NFS is _very_ simple to set up.  One thing though, you need to have synchronized UIDs for all clients.
[02:05] <Draconicus> arcade: I can't even figure out how to do a line return in that thing. :P
[02:05] <Draconicus> arcade: I know this. That's no problem.
[02:06] <ompaul> Draconicus, msg me and I will give you a two minute run through in vim that will allow you do a basic edit in it
[02:06] <arcade> Draconicus: Then NFS isn't a problem at all.  It's just /mountpoint   IP(accesscontrol) .. on one line in /etc/exports to share that mountpoint to the ip's..
[02:07] <arcade> Draconicus: for example: /export/home  192.168.0.*(rw,root_squash,async)
[02:07] <arcade> and whoopsidoe, you've shared /export/home to the ip's, with read-write access, root is squashed, and 'async' means that the clients don't hang if the nfs-server is rebooted (but they'll get a stale nfs handle)
[02:08] <ompaul> arcade, whoopsidoe - is that a wiggles reference?
[02:08] <arcade> ompaul: If it was, it got ingrained into my language without me knowing the original reference.
[02:09] <ompaul> arcade, a .au kiddies tv show
[02:09] <arcade> ompaul: Definately a 'nope' then. :)
[02:09] <Jude> ompaul: ompaul == .au? :)
[02:09] <Jude> ompaul: We're going to take over the world, yeah!
[02:10] <captainredbeard> can someone point me in the direction of the best version of doom you can get for ubuntu? One that can be played full screen, with enchanced graphics?

[02:12] <mla> Hi all
[02:12] <DBO> hi mla
[02:12] <mla> Anybody have an idea about dvd support and totem with gstreamer 0.10 ?
[02:13] <Azrazel> Hey, I upgraded from Breezy to Dapper RC but now it hangs on "waiting for root file system" during bootup. Any ideas of how to fix it?
[02:13] <DBO> mla, dapper drake support is in #ubuntu+1
[02:13] <mla> ok thanks
[02:13] <DBO> Azrazel, same for you
[02:14] <Azrazel> Hmm... everybody seems to be occupied, but thanks anyway ;)
[02:14] <WarOfAttrition> I will avoid upgrading from breezy like the plague
[02:14] <procrastinator> is it a known issue that nautilus wants pmount to mount a drive instead of a partition (like, trying to mount sda instead of sda1)?
[02:15] <ompaul> procrastinator, I have not seen that on any of my boxes server or desktop 5.10 or dapper
[02:16] <ompaul> WarOfAttrition, that is your right, however be aware that 5.10 is not supported in just under a year, and dapper will be supported for more than 18 months
[02:17] <ompaul> WarOfAttrition, dapper 3 years on the desktop and 5 on the server
[02:17] <WarOfAttrition> ompaul|  I mean I will install fresh, not as an upgrade to the breezy install
[02:17] <ompaul> WarOfAttrition, either way back up your home directory before you start
[02:19] <WarOfAttrition> ompaul|  yeah, I am just going to copy my files, the config files I will do over
[02:20] <Evanescent> hi anyone here?
[02:20] <DBO> just us mice
[02:20] <Evanescent> i don't know if anyone can help me
[02:20] <DBO> we wont either until you ask a question =)
[02:21] <neck_> :)
[02:22] <Evanescent> but my ubuntu is showing my max available screen resolutiona as 1024 x 768 but my screen is capabable of 1280 x 1024, how can I change that?
[02:22] <Drac[Server] > What the hell? How am I supposed to use NFS with dynamic IP addresses?! I can't make them all static!
[02:22] <DBO> !fixres
[02:22] <ubotu> Help to fix the display resolution is available at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[02:23] <Evanescent> thanks i'll have a read
[02:23] <Sentenza> hi people
[02:23] <Sentenza> is there a french help channel pliz ?
[02:23] <DBO> Drac[Server] , you cant, NFS servers should have static IP's, you can configure your DHCP server to maintain static IP's
[02:23] <DBO> !fr
[02:23] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[02:23] <Sentenza> ty
[02:24] <arcade> Drac[Server] : Hm?
[02:24] <DBO> Drac[Server] , the only thing that needs a static IP is the server itself
[02:25] <arcade> Drac[Server] : dynamic addresse?  The only proper way to use NFS is if the NFS-server is on the same network segments as the clients, and then you share for the entire segment.
[02:25] <arcade> I'm sure you can do it in other ways, but NFS isn't a "secure" file sharing protocol :)
[02:26] <DBO> arcade, well according to slashdot, neither is SSH... because if someone else has root on your local box (duh.....)  =P
[02:26] <Subhuman> DBO, dont allow root ssh logins.
[02:27] <DBO> Subhuman, no thats not what they were talking about... but thanks for the tip?  (me doesnt even have root enabled...)
[02:27] <Subhuman> DBO, with ssh i always use it with fail2ban, stops most ssh/apache/ftp attacks.
[02:27] <crazy_penguin> has anybody any sugestion how to demux an avi file so that i can record/remove  the sound? what program could i use
[02:29] <WarOfAttrition> crazy_penguin|  native linux I dont, but I can say maybe try using wine. not sure if virtualdubmod will work there, but a while back that's what I used
[02:30] <crazy_penguin> Subhuman: excuse me for intruding. what is fail2ban?
[02:30] <crazy_penguin> WarOfAttrition: thx
[02:30] <DBO> it bans IP's that fail too many authentications
[02:30] <crazy_penguin> i will try it
[02:30] <crazy_penguin> DBO: oh. thx
[02:31] <DBO> which isnt really needed with SSH since you should be using a public key setup, not password
[02:31] <T`> anyone know if ubuntu will be moving to newer kernel?
[02:31] <T`> 2.6.17 or so?
[02:32] <Subhuman> DBO, but the idea with ssh is you can access a box remotely, and carrying arround keys all the time is annoying
[02:32] <T`> and when.. perhaps?
[02:32] <Quintok> T`, you can compile the vanilla kernel if you like... as for when ubuntu goes I dunno
[02:32] <T`> dont want to go thru that drama :/
[02:33] <WarOfAttrition> aren't the new kernels buggy?
[02:33] <DBO> Subhuman, there are fairly easy ways to deal with that
[02:33] <DBO> Subhuman, USB keychains being one of them (since you can also put passwords on those keys)
[02:34] <Subhuman> DBO, i know that.
[02:34] <DBO> Subhuman, i know you do... i dont really find it annoying considering how well it negates the effect of a man in the middle attack
[02:35] <Axolotl> Hi! I have a big sproblem, i try to install dapper rc on a new system with a ATI X850 graphic card. The X-server cannot start, so i cannot install. Any help would be appreciated, i am a complete linux noob :-)
[02:35] <Subhuman> but I'm jsut saying if im on holiday i dont want to be a total looser and bring a usb key with me, bad enough im using a secure shell to log in to my linux box you know ;)
[02:35] <DBO> !dapper
[02:35] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[02:35] <Subhuman> i gotta keep SOME social respect :D
[02:35] <Axolotl> ok, thanks :-)
[02:35] <DBO> Subhuman, social respect?  you want social respect?  bring four usb keychains, and wear them all at once... nothing says player like four usb keychains
[02:36] <Quintok> bit of usb bling? I like it.
[02:36] <Subhuman> my usb is already all polished down to make it all metal shiny but still no :P
[02:37] <Subhuman> all my local boxes i use keys, but i keep one box open to the outside world and im keep that password, just makes things easier.
[02:38] <WarOfAttrition> so the dapper release of june 1 is a sure thing now?
[02:39] <DBO> Subhuman, out setup is done such that one workstation has outside access via a key.  That workstation is the ONLY box that has access to the SSH servers on the other machines (controlled at the network layer) as well as using public keys and passphrases
[02:39] <DBO> our*
[02:41] <Subhuman> if your password is good enough and you change it frequently then it isnt an issue
[02:41] <Subhuman> imo anywya
[02:41] <darkteckno> if we already have dapper do we have to reinstall?
[02:41] <zoheb> guys, what the name of JDK package for Ubuntu ?
[02:42] <DBO> Subhuman, password authentication leaves you open to a man in the middle attack
[02:42] <DBO> darkteckno, no
[02:42] <darkteckno> great thanks!
[02:43] <darkteckno> Is there a live version of dapper RC?
[02:43] <DBO> all versions of dapper RC are a live version
[02:43] <Subhuman> true, but is someone THAT desperate to get into my box, that they will find the network im going to conect on, do an ARP attack, then steal my password for a limited access accout?
[02:44] <Subhuman> no, no1 is. so i dont worry about that crap.
[02:44] <darkteckno> thanks DBO
[02:44] <DBO> Subhuman, while the risk is tiny, the implications of such a breach (at least in my case) would be monstrous...  So the precaution is well headed
[02:44] <Quintok> Subhuman, maybe your evil lost long twin?
[02:45] <Subhuman> public/private key encryption is also vulnerable to mitm attacks
[02:45] <Quintok> long lost*
[02:45] <DBO> Subhuman, yes, but only if they can decrypt it... which they cant
[02:45] <Subhuman> I live in the same town as GCHQ "government communication headquaters" (in the UK), a guy came to my school and showed how RSA is vulnerable to mitm
[02:46] <DBO> we use DSA
[02:46] <Subhuman> same principle though.
[02:46] <Subhuman> a public key and private key
[02:47] <DBO> password authentication uses RSA and is at risk, but with public key no unencrypted traffic is ever sent and is not vulnerable
[02:47] <Subhuman> rsa is public key.
[02:48] <DBO> RSA is also used for password authentication
[02:49] <DBO> public key encryptions only mitm attack vector requires decrypting and re-encrypting the key (fast), which is just not do-able with todays computers
[02:49] <Subhuman> i just think it's overkill.
[02:50] <DBO> wait until your job and reputation depends on it =P
[02:50] <Subhuman> i have nothing that secret or illegal, no1 is after me, if they did get access, the ssh account on that box has little or no rights, so meh :P
[02:51] <skip_> help please...I'm trying to log in to XFCE and get an error /bin/sh: /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc: No such file or directory
[02:53] <DBO> skip_, are you able to log in via terminal?
[02:53] <skip_> DBO: haven't tried that yet
=== Baal is now known as _Baal_
[02:54] <DBO> skip_, try that and see if you can find out if that file really doesnt exist or if its just a perms issue
[02:54] <skip_> DBO: I can log in via terminal and also via gdm
[02:55] <DBO> skip_, see if you can find the file mentioned in the error?
[02:55] <skip_> DBO: the file doesn't exist...so how do I recover it?
[02:55] <crazy_penguin> Subhuman, DBO: where could i find some good howtos or docs on the exciting subject that you discussed earlier. i also want to set up a small network and i'm surrounded by hacker wanabies ho are trying out their skills on my back? some links/urls please if you have.
[02:55] <skip_> DBO: I've tried clean reinstalling xfce but no luck
[02:55] <TheFez> Anybody know who I can change the notification daemon theme?
[02:55] <DBO> skip_, sudo find / -name xinitrc

[02:56] <Nukeador> hi all
[02:56] <crazy_penguin> thx
[02:56] <crazy_penguin> :)
[02:56] <crazy_penguin> thx a lot:)
[02:56] <Subhuman> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdvancedOpenSSH that link, halfway down is about key authentication
[02:56] <Subhuman> brb
[02:56] <DBO> crazy_penguin, instead of RSA use DSA =)
[02:56] <Nukeador> ive just burn the new rc to a friend and he told me that the cd stop reading after a while in the instalation preccess, any idea?
[02:56] <crazy_penguin> ok
[02:56] <crazy_penguin> i will remember
[02:57] <WarOfAttrition> Nukeador|  faulty burn or drive?
[02:57] <DBO> crazy_penguin, just to avoid confusion, you generate the key on your client machine, and place it on the server (common mistake amoung first timers)
[02:57] <crazy_penguin> ok
[02:57] <crazy_penguin> DBO: thx :)
[02:57] <Nukeador> WarOfAttrition, the thing is that the same happen to me few days ago with other cd perfectly burned
[02:58] <WarOfAttrition> might be the drive then
[02:59] <hav0k> does anyone know anything about ati cards and drivers for linux?
[02:59] <Nukeador> they are 2 drives completelly diferent
[02:59] <DrStrangelove> hey, i am new to dapper drake and i wanted to compile a precomiled module for cisco vpn

[03:01] <gnomnain> do you know how can I know where it hangs exactly ( in which function ) for the bug #46685 ?
[03:02] <_Baal_> I have installed Dapper with XFCE without a login manager on a slow computer.  The problem I am having is that with this setup if I select reboot or shutdown I am taken to a console and it doesn't actually reboot or shutdown.  Does anyone know where the script is that the quit button uses so that I could modify it?
[03:02] <Bilford> do you defrag disks with Linux
[03:03] <DBO> Bilford, no need to, ext3 doesnt fragment like that silly windows stuff
[03:03] <neck_> exactly
[03:03] <Bilford> cool
[03:03] <h3sp4wn> Bilford: You can but you have to downgrade the filesystem to ext2 and only if it is totally necessary
[03:03] <rod> is there are a way to install totem-xine and totem-gstreamer next to eachtother?
[03:04] <ompaul> Bilford, I doubt if your machine ever gets to the point where it needs to be defragged
[03:04] <h3sp4wn> Bilford: e2defrag does it
[03:04] <ompaul> !chroot
[03:04] <ubotu> chroot is, like, totally, at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebootstrapChroot and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24575
[03:04] <ompaul> rod, ^^^
[03:04] <Bilford> I never defragged   Windows
[03:05] <rod> ompaul, the solution is to chroot?
[03:05] <ompaul> rod, they will not live with each other at all afik
[03:05] <DBO> rod, its a working solution =P
[03:05] <Bilford> seemed like it strained the hard drive to defrag it
[03:05] <rod> omrolf  its a bit much me things
[03:05] <Bilford> so hard drives like Linux better than Windows, right
[03:05] <DBO> Bilford, yes it is a long stream of writing and reading... but it shouldnt really hurt it
[03:05] <rod> im sure it will work though ^^
[03:06] <DBO> Bilford, yes, I suppose linux would be easier on the drives...
[03:06] <ompaul> Bilford, well if you let it run and windows is faster after - or that is how it used ot be
[03:06] <rod> ok any way to play dvd's with gstreamer 0.10 then, with css? the wiki doesnt answer that
[03:06] <ompaul> Ubuntu
[03:06] <DBO> you need the libcss* package
[03:06] <rod> i have that
[03:07] <slew> hi. i have some mp4 video files that worked fine in totem. i got a totem update and now they wont play, it says it cant find a decoder. anyone know what i need to make it work again?
[03:08] <DBO> slew, dapper/
[03:08] <DBO> ?
[03:08] <pianoboy3333> Can anyone help me with an xserver problem?
[03:08] <slew> dbo yes
[03:08] <jcmcbeth> Anyone know of a apache channel?
[03:09] <pianoboy3333> jcmcbeth: #apache ?
[03:09] <DBO> slew, dapper is at #ubuntu+1
[03:09] <Bilford> is anyone here not going to upgrade to Dapper
[03:09] <slew> ok, i'll try there.
[03:09] <jcmcbeth> pianoboy3333: it didn't exist when I checked :-/
[03:09] <pianoboy3333> jcmcbeth: what irc client are you using?
[03:10] <Bilford> Im already using Dapper
[03:10] <DBO> Bilford, hard not to do what I already did =P
[03:10] <jcmcbeth> pianoboy3333: x-chat
[03:10] <DBO> Bilford, in general, dapper has a much longer support cycle than bb, and I recommend people upgrade AFTER the final release
[03:10] <pianoboy3333> jcmcbeth: ok, click on where it said #apache when I msged you
[03:10] <pianoboy3333> I think you just misspeled it
[03:10] <Bilford> is anyone here still using Hoary Hedgehog
[03:10] <phex> Hello i've a problem with the live cd
[03:10] <Fracture> is there any official ubuntu artwork for printing on cd's ?
[03:11] <pianoboy3333> DBO: AFTER the release? what's the fun in that?
[03:11] <DBO> pianoboy3333, less tech support...
[03:11] <pianoboy3333> but more fun, blinking screens, crashing X's...
[03:11] <rod> you mean you get less tech support if you install after?
[03:11] <pianoboy3333> no, less if now
[03:12] <phex> hey i've a kernel panic
[03:12] <Bilford> if you install it now, you are the tech support
[03:12] <DBO> rod, no, if you install now I give you little sympathy, it is beta... if you install later thats a final install which means its supposed to work
[03:12] <DBO> phex, what version of ubuntu?
[03:12] <phex> 5.10
[03:12] <DBO> phex, whats the error message?
[03:12] <gholias> Hi guys, Im a new ubuntu user and need some help
[03:12] <DBO> gholias, sure, whats your problem?
[03:13] <gholias> I have 2 networks pci adapters on my pc
[03:13] <gholias> one for cable modem, and another to share conection with other pc
[03:13] <phex> Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init
[03:13] <gholias> the one with cable moden is detected and named eth0
[03:13] <DBO> phex, reboot to recovery mode
[03:13] <gholias> the other is detected, but dont is the eth1
[03:14] <rod> DBO, but if i install after you wont give me little but no sympathy?
[03:14] <gholias> how can i associate this card with eth1?
[03:14] <phex> how can i come into the recovery mode?
[03:14] <Bilford> reboot
[03:14] <DBO> rod, if you install after I will tech support you all day long
[03:14] <DBO> phex, there is an entry in GRUB to do that
[03:14] <ompaul> DBO, your call
[03:15] <rod> hehe DBO that's nice of you
[03:15] <rod> but il prolly be running dap +1
[03:15] <rod> ^^
[03:15] <h3sp4wn> gholias: Is there a fixed ip address signed to eth1
[03:15] <DBO> rod, well then, no sympathy =P
[03:15] <rod> lol
[03:15] <gholias> h3sp4wn, theres no eth1
[03:15] <phex> entry if the first boot failure then is there an entry?
[03:15] <Bilford> noo sympathy for the Dapper
[03:16] <DBO> phex, its the second entry in the bootloader
[03:16] <gholias> DBO, did you undestand my problem? my english is poor
[03:16] <DBO> gholias, is there a cable plugged into the second card?
[03:17] <phex> now i've the same problem it'S the ubuntu live cd
[03:17] <h3sp4wn> gholias: open a terminal and run ifconfig -a (to see whether eth1 is listed there)
[03:17] <gholias> DBO,  yes, and the ubuntu show me it at devices manager, but associate with ethx
[03:17] <Bilford> what are most LInux programs?  uncompiled C?
[03:17] <WarOfAttrition> 3 years of support for dapper??? wow
[03:17] <WarOfAttrition> that's probably longer than the rest of my life!
[03:18] <gholias> h3sp4wn, no, just eth0
[03:18] <DBO> gholias, please enter the command "ifconfig" into a terminal and put the output at pastebin
[03:18] <DBO> !pastebin
[03:18] <ubotu> Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
[03:18] <gholias> dbo ifconfig only shows eth0, not eth1
[03:18] <DBO> gholen, do "sudo ifconfig eth1 up"
[03:19] <phex> hm he have reboot
[03:19] <thmas> i am not able to log in again. it there any known bug?
[03:19] <gholias> DBO, root@servidor:~# ifconfig eth1 up
[03:19] <gholias> eth1: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
[03:19] <phex> and now i've the same problem
[03:19] <brainlessbob> How do I open a directory with space in the name with terminal?
[03:19] <DBO> gholen, put your kernel log in pastebin please
[03:20] <gholias> dbo how can i do this?
[03:20] <Draconicus> brainlessbob: Put a \ before a space or an unusual character.
[03:20] <Desh> Does anyone know how I can change my DPI on KDE?
[03:20] <DBO> brainlessbob, put the path in quotes
[03:20] <prxq> hi. How can I get the sources of the kernel that ships with dapper?
[03:20] <brainlessbob> thanks :D
[03:20] <phex> i mean has the kernel panic some boot something to do with the boot cd?
[03:20] <gholen> DBO:  Done, it does work now, but the interface name is rausb0, and yes, I have a wireless connection, thank you everyone!
[03:20] <prxq> i mean the patched one, not the plain vanilla sources
[03:20] <phex> talk i to walls?
[03:20] <phex> -.-'
[03:20] <DBO> gholen, i didnt mean to talk to you, was a mistake =P
[03:20] <gholias> gholen != gholias :)
[03:21] <Draconicus> brainlessbob: Quotes work, but they aren't as practical. Putting a backslash will do the trick: blah/blah place/spaced stuff/ = blah/blah\ place/spaced stuff/. Also, tab completion is your best friend.
[03:21] <phex> he DBO
[03:21] <DBO> gholias, "gedit /var/log/kernel" and put that in pastebin
[03:21] <gholen> gholias: Nice nick!
[03:21] <DBO> phexyou need to be a little patient
[03:21] <gholias> gholen you too
[03:21] <phex> ok ok
[03:21] <podge> david and gholias
[03:21] <DBO> phex, so even when you select recovery mode you still get a kernel panic?
[03:21] <thmas> i am not able to log in again. it there any known bug?
[03:21] <gholen> gholias: I know ^^
[03:22] <DBO> thmas, can you log in at VT?
[03:22] <thmas> what is VT ?
[03:22] <Jeldert> hi guys (and girls)
[03:23] <gholias> DBO, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14729
[03:23] <gnomnain> thmas: try Ctrl+Alt+F1 and log in
[03:23] <ompaul> Jeldert, hi people
[03:23] <Jeldert> I want to share date between Linux and Windows (on the same machine). All my music and movies are on a 100GB NTFS partition, but I cannot write to it from Ubuntu. What filesystem do you recommend?
[03:24] <ompaul> Jeldert, get some of that space and make it vfat
[03:24] <Jeldert> I tried a ext3 reader/writer for Windows XP, but it slowed my machine down
[03:24] <gnomnain> Jeldert: use vfat
[03:24] <podge> Jeldert: Which way? Windows to Linux or Linux to Windows?
[03:24] <Subhuman> Jeldert, IFSDrives is a good ext3 driver for windows
[03:24] <jhenn> is it possible to install without enabling 'restricted copyright'?
[03:25] <Jeldert> podge, I want to keep dual-boot (for gaming), but also want write access in both linux and windows
[03:25] <DBO> sorry, I lagged out, anything said in the past 3 minutes toward me I missed
[03:25] <ompaul> jhenn, in the future I believe it will be (as in a few months) but not that I know at this time
[03:25] <Evanescent> hi, how do i save a file that i have modified in nano?
[03:25] <sparkleytone> ctrl-x
[03:25] <ompaul> Evanescent, ctrl X
[03:25] <sparkleytone> then type the name
[03:25] <Evanescent> thanks
[03:25] <h3sp4wn> Jeldert: Try captive ntfs (suppost to be pretty stable)
[03:25] <sparkleytone> or leave it
[03:26] <sparkleytone> then enter
[03:26] <ompaul> !captivefs
[03:26] <DBO> !captive
[03:26] <ubotu> I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ompaul
[03:26] <ubotu> captive is, like, a project to use windows NTFS drivers under linux. It does not work properly with Ubuntu.
[03:26] <Jeldert> Subhuman, it slowed Windows down, startup took 10 minutes, opening explorer 2 etc
[03:26] <ompaul> h3sp4wn, ^^^^^^^^ up a line
[03:27] <DBO> -_-
[03:27] <Dr_Willis> 'dont make me stop this car!'
[03:27] <H080J03> say if you have the 32 bit version of ubuntu is there any way to swicht to the 64 bit kernal?
[03:27] <rgolden_> morning
[03:27] <phex> -.-
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> H080J03,  i say stick with 32bit for the forseeable future
[03:28] <ompaul> H080J03, what is your choice more desktop than db or something else?
[03:28] <DBO> phex, so even when you select recovery mode you still get a kernel panic?
[03:28] <H080J03> desktop
[03:28] <rgolden_> how can I install JRE in firefox in Breezy
[03:28] <DBO> gholias, "gedit /var/log/kernel" and put that in pastebin
[03:28] <DBO> !java
[03:28] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[03:28] <ompaul> H080J03, stay with 32bit
[03:28] <podge> Jeldert: I agree with the other guys.. create a FAT partition for you music etc.. that way Linux can both access..
[03:28] <H080J03> hmm k
[03:28] <rgolden_> thanks
[03:28] <phex> hm maybe my box is patient but i doesn't be so patient is there nothing what i can do?
[03:28] <h3sp4wn> H080J03: You can do it you have to build your own kernel - make sure you have 32bit compatibility in it and a 64 bit libc
[03:28] <ompaul> H080J03, unless you like pain
[03:29] <gholias> DBO, /var/log/kernel isnt a file
[03:29] <Dr_Willis> I just use that "let windows xp read/write ext3 file system" tool. and keep all my shared data on a ext3 drive
[03:29] <DBO> gholias, "gedit /var/log/kern.log" and put that in pastebin
[03:29] <H080J03> k
[03:29] <H080J03> i will just stick with 32bit
[03:29] <podge> Dr_Willis: Yeah.. basically take NTFS out of the equation.. it is annoying.. :(
[03:29] <Jeldert> podge, ok
[03:29] <H080J03> apt-get install kernel-image-2.6.11-9-amd64-k8
[03:30] <Dr_Willis> podge,  but i never can rember the url
[03:30] <H080J03> apt-get install kernel-image-2.6.11-9-amd64-k8
[03:30] <podge> Jeldert: Or follow the advice of Dr_Willis and move your music to an ext3 partition on Linux..
[03:30] <pianoboy3333> wtf is k8?
[03:30] <H080J03> hmm
[03:30] <Dr_Willis> www.fs-driver.org/  - lets XP read/write ext3
[03:30] <DBO> pianoboy3333, its the 64bit amd processors
[03:30] <H080J03> yea
[03:30] <DBO> H080J03, we are not your terminal =P
[03:30] <pianoboy3333> I thought k7 was AMD
[03:31] <DBO> pianoboy3333, thats the 32 bit AMD processors
=== spoopithy is now known as spoop
[03:31] <ompaul> pianoboy3333, k7 is below 64bit and less of the what the fine thing is that
[03:31] <Jeldert> Dr_Willis, tried that one, but it was slowing down my windows
[03:31] <phex> no one who can help me?
[03:31] <pianoboy3333> ompaul: is k8 in the mainstream repositories?
[03:32] <podge> Dapper is top quality.. works great on my nc8230..
[03:32] <DBO> phex, does booting to recovery mode result in a kernel panic as well???
[03:32] <Dr_Willis> Jeldert,  never seen thar at all
[03:32] <phex> yes
[03:32] <DBO> pianoboy3333, yes, but its 64bit, which means painful
[03:32] <pianoboy3333> heh
[03:32] <phex> i don't if this the recovery boot was because it's the live cd
[03:32] <DBO> phex, you are fairly hosed then...
[03:32] <DBO> phex, no no, a recovery boot
[03:32] <Dr_Willis> Jeldert,  in fact it seems faster to me then normal file operations  on XP
[03:33] <DBO> phex, when it gives you all the choices for what to boot when you turn your machine on
[03:33] <phex> so i'm a totally noob
[03:33] <DBO> the second choice says recovery mode
[03:33] <gholias> DBO, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14731
[03:33] <phex> he load the ubuntu live cd scernn
[03:33] <phex> screen
[03:33] <DBO> phex, did you install ubuntu to a hard drive yet?
[03:33] <phex> no i didn'T
[03:33] <phex> i want to test it
[03:34] <phex> before i install it
[03:34] <DBO> phex, ohhhh, we cant help you until its on a hard drive really...
[03:34] <phex> thats what i think
[03:34] <phex> all the time
[03:34] <g0dchild> how can i get the usb-flash device to mount on the directory specified in fstab?
[03:34] <DBO> phex, for whatever reason the live CD doesnt work for you, not much I can really do about that...
[03:34] <g0dchild> sometimes, for example, when i plug a device in it may show up as /dev/sdb or sdc
[03:34] <ompaul> phex,  choose a suitable image of todays software from cdimage.ubuntu.com
[03:35] <DBO> gholias, the kernel isnt seeing the thernet card...
[03:35] <DBO> gholen, what eth card is it?
[03:35] <h3sp4wn> phex: Try the dapper RC live cd (if you are using the breezy one)
[03:35] <gholias> DBO, realtek
[03:35] <phex> maybe you can explain what the bazaar is good for?
[03:36] <DBO> gholias, go look and see if you can find it in the hardware list
[03:36] <DBO> !hardware
[03:36] <ubotu> well, hardware is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport

[03:36] <h3sp4wn> gholias: Is it 2 ethernets cards built onto the board ?
[03:36] <gholias> dbo i can see it on hardware list
[03:36] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  yes
[03:36] <DBO> gholen, ooooh =P
[03:36] <phex> ok thank yoz
[03:36] <gholias> i can see both, but just one is eth0
[03:37] <gholias> the other isnt set any ethx
[03:37] <gholias> look this
[03:37] <gholen> DBO: It is a D-Link DWL-G122
[03:37] <DBO> gholias, yes, I can see that in your kernel log...  you are only getting 1 ethernet device detected, I think you have a driver issue

[03:38] <gnomefreak> but 2 turned into 4 here
[03:39] <gholias> gnomefreak, sorry again
[03:39] <DBO> gnomefreak, well its not his fault you have a small window =P
[03:40] <gnomefreak> DBO: my window is 86X23
[03:40] <speedo_> is there anyone who has installed xgl lib
[03:40] <gnomefreak> speedo_: #ubuntu-xgl for all you xgl needs or #ubuntu+1 you can try too
[03:41] <h3sp4wn> gholias: do you know the exact model of motherboard you have ? (I need to work out whether its one physical ethernet card with some sort of tagging or not)
[03:41] <gholias> DBO,  look, searching on google, i found a tutorial that said to add eth1 info at /etc/modprobe.conf, but this file isnt in my ubuntu
[03:42] <darkness_> can anyone tell me where to find the file ~/.themes dir ?
[03:42] <h3sp4wn> ~/
[03:42] <njan> darkness_, ~ means your home directory. Just cd ~/.themes
[03:43] <gholias> h3sp4wn, Im not sure, if i undestand what you said. I have one onboard card (its eth0) and another pci card (not with ethx)
[03:43] <njan> darkness_, if your home directory is /home/darkness, ~/.themes == /home/darkness/.themes
[03:43] <DBO> gholias, yes, use /etc/modprobe.d/aliases instead
[03:43] <h3sp4wn> gholias: I thought you said you had two ports on the motherboard
[03:44] <theine> gholias: maybe it's named differently? is there anything in the output of "ifconfig -a" that looks like a ethernet device?
[03:44] <Evanescent> Great, thanks for the help my screen resolution problem is resolved
[03:44] <Frogzoo> h3sp4wn: as long as the kernel has the right drivers, update /etc/network/interfaces should be all you need
[03:44] <WarOfAttrition> I think 1280x1024 is a distorted picture
[03:45] <Evanescent> though i've got a hell of a lot to learn about the terminal and the command line by the look of it
[03:45] <Frogzoo> !tell Evanescent about docs
[03:45] <sparkleytone> why does getting the damned jre or jdk for java have to be such a chore...
[03:45] <ravenlock> Hello,  My atheros based NIC can't seem to get a IP address from my DHCP server.  The card/setup is functioning fine otherwise.
[03:45] <Frogzoo> sparkleytone: it's pretty easy actually
[03:45] <Frogzoo> !java
[03:45] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[03:45] <sparkleytone> not installing
[03:46] <podge> !java
[03:46] <sparkleytone> actually getting
[03:46] <sparkleytone> ;)
[03:46] <theine> sparkleytone: on Dapper you just install the sun-java5-jre package and are done
[03:46] <gholias> theine, yes, just one card is an  ethernet device
[03:46] <sparkleytone> theine: so no more holy war against java in dapper?
[03:46] <theine> sparkleytone: there has never been one as far as I know
[03:46] <gholias> DBO, /etc/modprobe.d/aliases dont list eth0, should i add this line alias eth1 8139too?
[03:47] <theine> sparkleytone: sun-java5-jre is in the multiverse repo though
[03:47] <h3sp4wn> Frogzoo: What I was thinking was the motherboard just had one physical ethernet connection (but two ports) I have had to set that up before (but it isn't relevant seen as one of the cards is a pci (but not as he said before))
[03:47] <sparkleytone> the debian folks have had a java chip on their shoulders for a while now
[03:47] <Frogzoo> gholias: you won't see eth0 there - only the driver
[03:47] <gholias> DBO, 8139too is the modulo of realtek cards
[03:47] <sparkleytone> and while i don't blame them at all...java is just too important these days
[03:47] <Nukeador> Any1 have any idea to avoid cdrom hanging during the install with the desktop cd?
[03:47] <theine> gholias: and do you see anything that looks like a second ethernet card in the dmesg output?
[03:48] <DBO> gholias, do whatever your walkthrough tells you do, I havent configured one of those cards ever, I was just pointing you to the file you were looking for =P
[03:48] <WarOfAttrition> I just used automatrix to install java I'm sorry to say. Now I know how to do it, but a couple of months ago I just wanted it to work
[03:48] <Frogzoo> sparkleytone: blame the foss peeps who think their free implementation > the people who own java - go figure
[03:48] <Frogzoo> !automatix
[03:48] <ubotu> from memory, automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
[03:48] <darkness_> OK, could someone tell me how to manually extract a file into the ~/.themes fold?
[03:48] <Frogzoo> darkness_: install gnome-art
[03:48] <Frogzoo> !themes
[03:49] <sparkleytone> Frogzoo: nah...i blame sun for being so stupid with their licensing as much as i blame GPL-commies for being anal about it
[03:49] <Daemon> BRS ?
[03:49] <gholias> theine, how can i do this? dmesg |grep
[03:49] <Frogzoo> !tell darkness_ about themes
[03:49] <theine> gholias: I'd do "dmesg | less" and just browse through the output
[03:49] <podge> sparkleytone: Agreed. Sun should be opening the doors wide for Java on Linux.
[03:49] <h3sp4wn> 0000:00:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10) is probably the onboard one and 0000:00:08.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS) looks like the pci one
[03:49] <arrummzen> I have someone who borked their /etc/X11/xorg.conf file... does Ubuntu have some niffty tool to fix it for them?
=== Quintok is now known as Quintok|Away
[03:50] <darkness_> Frgozoo: Thanks. I'm just trying to get my desktop looking a bit better, so I'm trying to experiment with a OSX type look.
[03:50] <sparkleytone> arrummzen: dpkg-reconfigure xorg maybe?
[03:50] <sparkleytone> heh os x 'look' ... i just use os x ;)
[03:50] <WarOfAttrition> arrummzen|  either that or copy a backup
[03:50] <podge> sparkleytone: Shouldn't matter that it isn't Solaris. It should be about promoting Java on a growth platform.
[03:50] <theine> arrummzen: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[03:50] <gholias> h3sp4wn, right, you are right
[03:51] <ravenlock> anyone have any idea why I might not be able to get an ip address from my dhcp server with my atheros card (using madwifi)
[03:51] <sparkleytone> podge: i think it has less to do with solaris and more to do with the leverage that java gives them
[03:51] <arrummzen> WarOfAttrition: the backup didn't seem to work?
[03:51] <darkness_> Spakeleytone: Meh. I just don't have the money to fork out over it. Anyway, I like Ubuntu. I just don't like the brown.
[03:51] <kismet> Why if update  groups of a user by user-admin on the existing "Konsole" application I'm not able to see the update?
[03:51] <WarOfAttrition> go to the /etc/X11/ folder and see if there anything like xorg.conf.backup
[03:51] <gholias> theine, nothing on dmesg
[03:52] <arrummzen> WarOfAttrition: there is, but it didn't work.
[03:52] <sparkleytone> i don't understand the money argument...just...save it instead of buying new crap for your pc or building a new pc as soon as you get a couple hundred bucks
[03:52] <h3sp4wn> gholias: try sudo modprobe ne2k-pci
[03:52] <WarOfAttrition> arrummzen| copy the newest backup into xorg.conf , or do what theine said
[03:52] <h3sp4wn> gholias: try sudo ifup eth1
[03:52] <took77> moin
[03:52] <theine> gholias: ok, so the driver (if there is one) for you network card isn't loaded then
[03:52] <arrummzen> WarOfAttrition: I just recomended what theine to him.
[03:53] <h3sp4wn> gholias: It needs ne2k-pci to be loaded not the realtek one
[03:53] <darkness_> I have a job, and I do save money. But I need to save it for more important things. Anyway, like I said; I like my Ubuntu and don't really won't to try OSX at the moment. I just want ubuntu to look better, and I was pointed to this tut that I'm suing

[03:54] <gholias> h3sp4wn, ifup eth1 returns alias Ignoring unknown interface eth1=eth1.
[03:54] <WarOfAttrition> arrummzen|  but the quickest way to do it if you mess with xorg.conf a lot is to copy a backup into the current. or better yet, view the x errors you get at start up, and edit the xorg.conf with nano accordingly
[03:54] <darkness_> Theine: No, it isn't. I'm just experimenting with changing the hole look.
[03:54] <Frogzoo> !tell theine about themes

[04:22] <DBO> cya, do you have a cold basement perhaps you can retreat to?  see if cooling things down lets it run longer without errors

[04:22] <cya> DBO: You mean running it for another 8 hours?
[04:22] <ZoDiaC13> is there a page that explains some keystroke shortcuts that can be used in linux?
[04:22] <DBO> cya... well... uhhh.... yes =)
[04:23] <cya> DBO: Ah, perhaps I should just swap the RAM out with another laptop and run Ubuntu to see if I encounter any further issues.
[04:23] <DBO> cya, or you can do that =P
[04:23] <DBO> cya, my only concern is that laptops often encounter heat issues, its not exactly BAD hardware, just overheating hardware

[04:50] <gholias> h3sp4wn, eth1: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
[04:51] <runge> hi
[04:51] <lemur> miano:  you have to add the respositories to /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:51] <runge> I have changed screen, and ubuntu sets default resutution to 640x480. this screen can handle much more, but I get no choice. How do I change?

[04:53] <ompaul> odat, in dapper?
[04:53] <runge> only 640*480
[04:53] <HotDrive> can anybody tell me how can I copy files to a Root owned directory?
[04:53] <miano> thanks lemur, i'll try that
[04:53] <gholias> h3sp4wn, http://pastebin.com/741224
[04:53] <ompaul> HotDrive, care to tell us more about this directory what kind of format has the file system?
[04:53] <Healot> HotDrive: "sudo"(ku)
[04:53] <lemur> runge, perhaps you need to modify your /etcX11/xorg.conf
[04:54] <h3sp4wn> gholias: pastebin lshw
[04:54] <mike12123> does the new version of ubuntu have support of apm built in?
[04:54] <runge> lemur, well, maybe I should. though the only thing I changed was the monitor, did not touch any files. I just want to have same resulutions I had before
[04:54] <HotDrive> what is the copy command?
[04:54] <runge> HotDrive, cp
[04:54] <ompaul> HotDrive, by any chance is that a windows or dos drive?
[04:55] <HotDrive> its in ubuntu dapper
[04:55] <lemur> runge, the xorg.conf file determines when the xorg server sees.  If you changed monitors without updating the conf file, it may not be able to do much.
[04:55] <ompaul> HotDrive, it is a dapper system, so it is a linux drive not a windows one?
[04:56] <spike> hi, does anybody know if you can dump deconf-selection for a non installed package? I cant find how
[04:56] <HotDrive> I want to copy files from Desktop to /usr/share/...
[04:56] <runge> lemur, ah ok. thanks for the info :)
[04:56] <spike> I need to create some preseeding file and want to install packages not installed on this box
[04:56] <Falc> Hello. I cannot get the Ubuntu LiveCD working on my Toshiba L20-197.
[04:56] <lemur> spike:  apt-cache show pkg_name
[04:56] <spike> so I cant just dumb answers with debconf-get-selections
[04:56] <HotDrive> ...but the system tells me that I canot copy files because I don't havepermission...
[04:56] <spike> lemur: eh?
[04:57] <eggzeck> HotDrive, 'sudo'
[04:57] <Falc> The problem is that my laptop will not display anything, when I use vga=771(i think) then it will load and load up a scrambled text-based message stating: "Xorg could not start"
[04:57] <spike> lemur:  how does that help?
[04:57] <VincentMX> yo
[04:57] <lemur> spkie, I may not have understood your question
[04:57] <ompaul> HotDrive, okay so >> sudo 'cp filename /usr/share' << however it is not usual that you would do that what are you trying to install?
[04:57] <eggzeck> HotDrive, sudp cp /whatever /wherever
[04:57] <h3sp4wn> gholias: (I only need the network parts from lshw)
[04:57] <HotDrive> using sudo can I copy an intire directory from Desktop to another directory?

[04:59] <Techno_2> How and where do I get mkinitrd from?
[04:59] <spike> ompaul: I'm asking for debconf-get-selections on not installed packages
[04:59] <HotDrive> so: the directory in desktop is called ABC... sudo cp -r /Desktop/ABC /usr/share/PPP/ABC ?
[05:00] <eggzeck> Techno_2, apt-cache search mkinitrd
[05:00] <ompaul> spike,  debconf-show  ?

[05:02] <HotDrive> do I need to create the destination directory before copying?

[05:03] <ompaul> HotDrive, what are you actually trying to install we might actually know a way to do it -- sudo mkdir foo

[05:04] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  i be right back
[05:04] <shanky> lemur: I can see this in dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14734
[05:04] <VincentMX> is there ever going to come something like an ubuntu media center thing? It would be nice to have something using Freevo or MythTV, so you can have a user friendly kind of winmce
[05:04] <shanky> but anything else

[05:05] <HotDrive> ompaul -> I have a skin for aMSN in Desktop and I want to copy it to /usr/share/amsn/skins/
[05:05] <lemur> shanky does lspci say anything about unknown hardware?
[05:05] <ompaul> HotDrive, have you got amsn installed?
[05:05] <HotDrive> yes
[05:06] <shanky> lemur: no
[05:06] <HotDrive> I downloaded the skins in zip format and unziped them in Desktop

[05:06] <ompaul> HotDrive, so do this first, sudo updatedb then do this, locate amsn | grep skin
[05:07] <ompaul> HotDrive, that is to find it on your machine for sure
[05:07] <lemur> shanky: do you have any sda devices in /dev?  ls -l /dev/sda*
[05:07] <Techno_2> eggzeck: I tried that and there is no mkinitrd package?
[05:08] <HotDrive> now I just have to copy them to the /skins directory in amsn
[05:08] <elsie-dee> lemur: unfortunately that does not help me as i am looking to register a messenger protocol for use with gaim, not a file type
[05:08] <shanky> lemur: no, I haven't anything like /dev/sd*
[05:08] <ompaul> HotDrive, step 1 >>cd /usr/share/amsn/skins/<<
[05:09] <ompaul> HotDrive, got that done yet?
[05:09] <lemur> hmm, my sata drives on via hardware show up as /dev/sda* devices
[05:09] <HotDrive> yes
[05:09] <lemur> shannky: hmm, my sata drives on via hardware show up as /dev/sda* devices

[05:11] <ompaul> HotDrive, a lower case letter is different to an upper case letter when dealing with text on the command line
[05:12] <shanky> lemur: it could be that the hd is not already formatted?
[05:12] <HotDrive> well it copied the files but didn't stored them in a new directory
[05:12] <lemur> shanky: you should see an sda device in /dev if your kernel recognizes the sata drive
[05:12] <BuCKetHeaD27> can anyone tell me how to automatically download packages when installing a program?
[05:13] <ompaul> ubotu tell BuCKetHeaD27 about synaptic
[05:13] <HotDrive> I need to create the destination directory first and type the p command from there, right?
[05:13] <ompaul> BuCKetHeaD27, it happens when you use the tools provided
[05:13] <lemur> shanky: formatting does not matter
[05:13] <HotDrive> sorry -> cp command
[05:13] <ompaul> HotDrive, yes, from what you said already I took it you had done that
[05:14] <BuCKetHeaD27> i use synaptic. its just everytime i go to install a program it says a certain package is not installed. I then install it through synaptic. But isn't there a way to install them automatically?
[05:14] <rab> how can i tell the remaining space on my disk from the terminal

[05:23] <lemur> tdshiv, that file belongs to root, you must be root to replace that file
[05:23] <tdshiv> how do i become root?
[05:23] <lemur> sudo su -
[05:24] <lemur> or if you just use vi
[05:24] <EmxBA> gnomefreak: i remember you from yesterday....could you help me

[05:24] <lemur> ompaul, sorry
[05:24] <tdshiv> that was a huge help
[05:25] <tdshiv> thanks again
[05:25] <ompaul> lemur, what should be there if at all is sudo -i
[05:25] <lemur> won't happen again
[05:25] <ompaul> lemur, point them at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
[05:25] <gnomefreak> EmxBA: whats wrong?
[05:26] <EmxBA> gnomefreak: thanks god! you remember me
[05:26] <lemur> ompaul, good tip.  I first used sudo last week.  On BSD i have always su -l so...
[05:26] <EmxBA> igo on PM
[05:26] <gnomefreak> give me a few days i could forget ;)
[05:28] <lemur> afk, my children are fighting
[05:28] <kermitX_> let 'em go.... when it's all done, maybe you get lucky and have one less mouth to feed. ;)
[05:28] <varsendagger> i've been trying to go in through the web page but i'm not getting anything
[05:28] <varsendagger> twager, ^^^
[05:28] <HotDrive> the rm command cannot delete a directory, only files?
[05:28] <lemur> rm -r
[05:28] <twager> Hello..
[05:29] <Subhuman> hey, im getting this error"   libdrm-dev: Depends: libdrm2 (= 2.0-0ubuntu1) but 2.0-0ubuntu7 is to be installed ". i kno a apt-get remove libdrm2 && apt-get install libdrm2 will fix it, but libdrm2 is required by ALOT of packages, anyway to reinstall without having to remove all the things that depend on it?
[05:29] <leethal> how come the update manager tells me that there's no updates from a CD I burned 6 months ago?
[05:30] <twager> I get the same result...Maybe a glitch in the system...Tomorrow will tell..
[05:30] <varsendagger> waht is a .asx file
[05:30] <lemur> leethal, if you boot from a live cd the update manager is somewhat disabled
[05:30] <Subhuman> varsendagger, a movie file
[05:30] <varsendagger> twager, so you usually get it
[05:30] <varsendagger> Subhuman, thanks
[05:30] <Techno_2> How do I make the initrd file?
[05:31] <twager> It was ok a few days ago..
[05:31] <varsendagger> hey i have a script i want to run it when the system starts up and then roughly every 6 hours
[05:31] <varsendagger> twager, twager, must be a tweak in the system
[05:31] <lemur> varse dagger, crontab is your friend
[05:31] <HotDrive> It worked! thank you all for the help. sorry for th dumb questions but I'm using linux for 3 days, so... kind of newbie...
[05:31] <lemur> varsedagger, crontab is your friend
[05:32] <varsendagger> is that a program that i can run
[05:32] <paul_> Ive got a newbie question of course. How do you set screensavers in ubuntu? For that matter another app synoptic package manager throws an error saying no such file. Help please:)
[05:32] <lemur> hotdrive, everyone starts somewhere :)
[05:32] <linuxcrazy> ok guys, I have an Ubuntu problem
[05:32] <linuxcrazy> this guy had a ISA ethernet card, and now he knows that ISA and Ubuntu don't work
[05:32] <Draconicus> That's what this channel is for.
[05:32] <linuxcrazy> He has put a PCI card in
[05:33] <lemur> varsendagger crontab is a program.  If you like man pages, man crontab, man 5 crontab
[05:33] <Draconicus> linux_galore: They can. Just not really well with ethernet cards. Most ISA ethernet cards are 10Mbit. You don't want to use them anyway.
[05:33] <linuxcrazy> but he has to tell Ubuntu to take it, right?
[05:33] <linuxcrazy> right ok
[05:33] <mjr> (ISA stuff works, just probably not automatically. That's not the ISA way :)
=== IoFran is now known as Kokis
[05:33] <h3sp4wn> linuxcrazy: If it is a non pnp isa you have to specify the memory addresses it needs
[05:33] <varsendagger> lemur,
[05:33] <varsendagger> thanks
[05:34] <xerath_> Since i reconfigured locales to set my system locale to iso-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, the system (ie perl) complains about missing locale support every time I install new packages. I feel like I'm missing some localesupport.. Any idea where I can get this? (dapper rc server amd64)
[05:34] <Draconicus> linuxcrazy: I strongly suggest you just invest in a PCI ethernet card. They're not expensive, and they blow away ISA.
[05:35] <Blippe> what is the name of tht package which counted the number of ubuntu-installations?
[05:35] <EmxBA> linuxcrazy: ISA cards are old and almost are not in use anymore
[05:36] <Napoleon> Any ISP I've been with will give you a free ethernet card if you don't have one...
[05:37] <Napoleon> Well except back when it was dialup of course.
[05:37] <xerath_> dialup is so 1980s :p
[05:37] <Lord_Athur> hi all
[05:37] <xerath_> along with ISA hehe
[05:37] <paul_> oh well off to research more on my ubuntu problems. Later gators
[05:37] <h3sp4wn> 90's probably more than 80's
=== Kokis is now known as IoFran
[05:38] <Lord_Athur> I want to get some Ubuntu CDs at https://shipit.ubuntu.com/, but, will the be the version 6.04?
[05:38] <varsendagger> hey how do i change the mousover properties
[05:38] <piller> Is this the place to discuss possible dapper RC bugs?
=== carlos_ is now known as carlos
[05:40] <Lord_Athur> Please, could anyone answer my question?
[05:40] <lufis> Where did configuration editor go in dapper?
[05:40] <Napoleon> piller: #ubuntu+1
[05:40] <leethal> lemur: no, I'm on an installed ubuntu
[05:40] <PyroMithrandir> Lord_Athur, there won't be a 6.04
[05:40] <PyroMithrandir> there will be a 6.06
[05:40] <piller> Napoleon: thanks.
[05:41] <NickGarvey> the release numbers are based on the dates
[05:41] <Draconicus> lufis: Use the Alacart menu editor to enable all items in the "System Tools" menu.
[05:41] <PyroMithrandir> it will officially come out in a few days, but there is a stable release candidate out if you want to get that
[05:41] <NickGarvey> its being released in june 06, 06.06
[05:41] <lufis> Dracon, why in god's name was it removed anyway?
[05:41] <xerath_> Since i reconfigured locales to set my system locale to iso-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, the system (ie perl) complains about missing locale support every time I install new packages. I feel like I'm missing some localesupport.. Any idea what the packagenames would be? (dapper rc server amd64)
[05:41] <lemur> varsendagger: System -> Preferences -> Windows
[05:41] <Draconicus> lufis: Beats the hell out of me. I never figured that out either.
[05:41] <lufis> Dracon: Thanks ;)
[05:42] <Napoleon> NickGarvey: purposefully on 6/6/6 ?
[05:42] <Lord_Athur> so PyroMithrandir when may I try to get one (Drapper)? do you have a date?
[05:42] <Draconicus> lufis: You're very welcome. )
[05:42] <Draconicus> :)*
[05:42] <PyroMithrandir> you can get the release candidate now, Lord_Athur
[05:42] <nixuser> whats a good ap for converting mp3 to wav in ubuntu?
[05:42] <Lord_Athur> :)
[05:43] <lemur> leethal: then I would guess that it has somethign to do with /etc/atp/sources.list
[05:43] <Healot> nixuser> LAME
[05:43] <Draconicus> nixuser: Audacity. Be sure to install the appropriate libraries.
[05:43] <nixuser> lame is command line correct?
[05:43] <Lord_Athur> I've to go, many thanks to all
[05:43] <Napoleon> Lord_Athur: Dapper
[05:43] <nixuser> ok i thought about audacity, what are the appropriate libs?
[05:43] <Draconicus> nixuser: LAME is command line. Audacity is an extensive graphical mixer.
[05:43] <malbicho> hello all, im having a kernel panic anyone can help me?
[05:43] <nightshift> hi. i want to upgrade my Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger) to 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake), but when I execute the command: gksudo "update-manager -d", as the Ubuntu site instructs, I get the following message when the program wants to download and install the upgrade: "Could not calculate the update. An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade." Does anyone here knows how I can upgrade correctly?
[05:43] <lemur> nixuser use lame:  lame --decode some.mp3 some.wav
[05:44] <Draconicus> nixuser: lemur's advice is probably better.
[05:44] <NickGarvey> stop calling each names, no one is "lame" here
[05:44] <lemur> lol
[05:44] <nixuser> kenyr dracoL thanks
[05:44] <PyroMithrandir> nightshift, are you using sudo?
[05:44] <lemur> lame is a program
[05:44] <malbicho> lol
[05:44] <NickGarvey> I know it was a joke ;)
[05:44] <PyroMithrandir> you'd have problems if you weren't
[05:44] <nightshift> maybe thats the problem.. i'll try
[05:44] <leethal> haha
[05:44] <kermitX_> lame is a guy who lives in nimrod, minnesota
[05:44] <PyroMithrandir> ha, nimrod is a horrible name for a town
[05:44] <linuxcrazy_frame> hey
[05:44] <linuxcrazy_frame> sorry
[05:45] <kermitX_> it's a real town, look it up! ;)
[05:45] <linuxcrazy_frame> my power went out
[05:45] <Logidrop> Is it possible to get rid of that ubuntu logo in the top left of gnome next to Applications?
[05:45] <PyroMithrandir> in the parades there, they have a little girl beauty contest... little miss nimrod
[05:45] <linuxcrazy_frame> ok, how does this guy reconfigure his ethernet?
[05:45] <PyroMithrandir> oh, kermitX_ , I know it is a town, my grandparents live near there
[05:45] <linuxcrazy_frame> eth0 ifupdown eth0 ifup
[05:45] <linuxcrazy_frame> ?
[05:45] <linuxcrazy_frame> idk
[05:46] <Draconicus> linux_galore: Sort of close. I don't recall the exact...
[05:46] <linuxcrazy_frame> anybody want to help?!
[05:46] <linuxcrazy_frame> lol
[05:46] <Draconicus> !patience
[05:46] <nightshift> no. still the same problem again...
[05:46] <ubotu> The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
[05:46] <kermitX_> lol, it's in the WIKI ! :)
[05:46] <linuxcrazy_frame> ok
[05:46] <linuxcrazy_frame> link please?
[05:46] <lemur> ifdown eth0
[05:46] <xerath_> Since i reconfigured locales to set my system locale to iso-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, the system (ie perl) complains about missing locale support every time I install new packages. I feel like I'm missing some localesupport.. Any idea what the packagenames would be? (dapper rc server amd64)
[05:46] <Napoleon> how do you grep from stdin
[05:46] <nightshift> Still cannot upgrade to dapper drake
[05:46] <malbicho> im having a kernel panic anyone can help me?
[05:46] <linuxcrazy_frame> lemur: is that it?!
[05:46] <Draconicus> nightshift: What are you doing?
[05:47] <Napoleon> like 'grep pattern output-from-netstat'
[05:47] <nightshift> gksudo "update-manager -d", as the Ubuntu site instructs
[05:47] <nightshift> Then I click on Upgrade
[05:47] <lemur> linuxcrazy_frame: what are you trying to do?
[05:47] <Draconicus> Hmm..
[05:47] <Draconicus> I've never heard of that not working before.
[05:47] <linuxcrazy_frame> this guy has installed an ethernet card after he install Ubuntu
[05:47] <linuxcrazy_frame> installed*
[05:48] <linuxcrazy_frame> he wants to hook it up to the internet
[05:48] <lemur> nightshift, i upgraded to dapper drake from unbuntu 5.10 by changing every breezy to dapper in /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:48] <nightshift> ok i'll try... tnx
[05:49] <linuxcrazy_frame> any ideas?
[05:49] <Draconicus> linuxcrazy_frame: It's not ISA, is it?
[05:49] <lemur> nightshift: then I ran sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:49] <linuxcrazy_frame> Draconius: no
[05:49] <varsendagger> hey how do i make a program run sudo without having to type sudo everythinme
[05:49] <Draconicus> It should work on its own...
[05:49] <lemur> varsendagger, what user must the script runner under?
[05:49] <gandm> Hi there! I've recently (well, yesterday) updated to dapper dracke and I'm loving it so far. The only trouble I have lies in the awesome new deskbar feature the new gnome sports. Now, the problem is that it works fine when I input an e-mail adress (evolution starts), but it doesn't work when I want to search google, amazon or any other of the web-thingies (I also can't open a webpage from within the deskbar)... Has anyone got an a
[05:49] <gandm> nswer to that? Thanks in advance.
[05:50] <DBO> gandm, make sure your default browser is configured
[05:51] <varsendagger> lemur, i want to run it with crontab and as i can see i need to be logged in as my regular user to have it run
[05:51] <nixuser> seems audacity works just fine here
[05:51] <crazy_penguin> same here
[05:51] <Draconicus> gandm: I don't have an answer, but I will note that I personally hate Deskbar as a replacement for the Command Line applet. :P
[05:52] <acx4> Hi anyone know hot to get a Lexmark 6750 working in ubuntu Drapper Drake?
[05:52] <ere> 40 teachers with laptops wants to have access to shared filesystems. Currently they all have a local user account on their pc with identical usernames on all pc's (teacher). How would you implement a authentication system? LDAP is nice as long as they are connected to the network, but they are not all the time. Maybe a local useraccount as well as an account in the LDAP dir with the same user id?
[05:53] <gandm> thanks DBO, i'm going to look into that... @Draco: well, I thought so too first (as it replaced my command line applet without asking), but I got used to it pretty fast
[05:53] <Draconicus> I think the Deskbar and Command Line applet should have remained separate. The Deskbar lacks half the functions of the Command Line applet, such as autocompleting and editing reinputted, historically entered commands.
[05:54] <wubrgamer> hey gusy
[05:55] <h3sp4wn> what is the proper way to change the default system editor to vim (from nano I think it is) using update-alternatives ?
[05:55] <gandm> hmm, I didn't miss the auto-completion till you pointed it out... gnah :/
[05:56] <wiggieXpectsLess> quick question: can i install listen media player in breezy badger?
[05:56] <wiggieXpectsLess> i tried and failed
[05:56] <wubrgamer> quick thing, i want to install ubuntu on an old p2, but i'm not sure whether or not to install the dapper release (i am willing to put up with bugs and quirks if i can just apt-get upgrade them all way when dapper final releases) or breezy...and breezy is nice, but i'd rather not mess with upgrading from one version of breezy to dapper...much rather just have dapper.....
[05:57] <gandm> DBO, thanks a lot, seems like the defaults got messed up with the install, after changing to firefox the deskbar now works as advertised :)
[05:57] <h3sp4wn> wubrgamer: If don't have alot of ram you should use xubuntu or kanotix
[05:57] <wubrgamer> i've got 512
[05:57] <wubrgamer> but it's in a 400 mhz system
[05:57] <h3sp4wn> wubrgamer: ubuntu should probably be ok with 512
[05:57] <DBO> gandm, glad to help
[05:58] <EmxBA> gnomefreak: are you back
[05:58] <lemur> varsendagger, i have been trying to send you private messages.  Did they work?
[05:58] <wubrgamer> nope
[05:58] <wubrgamer> sorry
[05:59] <darius_> ntp-server won't install on a fresh Dapper RC1.  "User ntp does not exist"  I have another Dapper install that was upgraded from 5.10 and it works fine
[05:59] <EmxBA> does anyone know how to solve hibernating
[05:59] <darius_> my working system does not have an 'ntp' user
[05:59] <batman> just wondering but are there any extra drivers i can download for ethernet cards?
[05:59] <wubrgamer> oh, if i install the dapper RC, and upgrade regularly, will it be the same thing as me installing a fresh copy of dapper on the day it comes out ?
[06:00] <Hobbsee> wubrgamer: yes
[06:00] <wubrgamer> thnx
[06:00] <ronlybonly> I have a question about the Ubuntu forums: How do the "beans" work? Doe you get a bean for each post you make or each post on a unique thread or what?
[06:00] <wubrgamer> all i wanted to know
[06:00] <wubrgamer> bye
[06:00] <wiggieXpectsLess> quick question: can i install listen media player in breezy badger?
[06:00] <EmxBA> i have notebook, and when I shutdown my computer and turn it on again it opens ~6 windows left in session before 2-3 days
[06:01] <varsendagger> lemur, no i forgot my password and i can't register
[06:01] <linuxcrazy_frame> lol
[06:01] <lemur> lol
[06:01] <lemur> ok, i'll resend them pub
[06:01] <varsendagger> ok

[06:02] <varsendagger> great
[06:02] <batman> are there any drivers i can download for ethernet cards?
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: so crontab -e then put * */4 * * * /full/path/to/script
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: that will run the script every 6 hours (24/4 is 6)
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: there is a special way to express on startup in cron
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: @reboot /full/path/to/script
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: so you would have 2 entries in your crontab
[06:02] <lemur> varsendagger: as verified with crontab -l
[06:02] <varsendagger> how do i writeout in emacks
[06:02] <tritium> lemur: don't paste please.  Use pastebin
[06:02] <lemur> tritium, what is pastebin?
[06:02] <tritium> !pastebin

[06:03] <varsendagger> how do i make my default editor vi?
[06:04] <tag> anyone know?
[06:04] <lemur> ubuntu uses vim for vi, but I forget how to change it
[06:04] <apokryphos> varsendagger: use EDITOR variable, but it in bash profile/rc
[06:04] <lemur> ah, yeah
[06:04] <gnomefreak> varsendagger: sudo update-alternatives --all will let you change all you default items (cant remember what one is editor)
[06:04] <lemur> export EDITOR=vi
[06:04] <varsendagger> ohh
[06:04] <lemur> I am new to bash

[06:05] <Napoleon> how do you find the IP of somebody who is sending you a file on msn
[06:05] <Kentaur> Hi
[06:05] <tag> stupid thing
[06:05] <Napoleon> well, on gaim using msn protocol
[06:05] <NickGarvey> Napoleon: um.. is it a direct connection?
[06:05] <Napoleon> NickGarvey: Yeah I know it's not hard
[06:05] <NickGarvey> Napoleon: if it is then I'd use ethereal, otherwise you can't
[06:06] <Napoleon> Somebody told me before.
[06:06] <NickGarvey> Napoleon: it needs to go right to you though, not through the msn servers
[06:06] <Napoleon> convos go through the servers
[06:06] <Napoleon> file transfers are direct though aren't they?
[06:06] <NickGarvey> I don't know

[06:07] <bigfoot1> i downloaded  a pdf file with japnaese text. how when i copy the text and try to paste it, output is a bunch of unintelligble characters. what should i do?
[06:07] <funkyHat> I believe MSN file transfers are sent through the MSN servers
[06:07] <Haydre> Anyone here tried installing the latest ATI drivers? (8.25.18) I've been having a ton of problems getting them to work.
[06:07] <funkyHat> I could be wrong though
[06:07] <NickGarvey> Napoleon: here, if you really want their ip, just have them go to http://nickgarvey.no-ip.org
[06:07] <NickGarvey> I'll give it to you
[06:07] <lemur> nickgarvey: bsd is what the adults use :)
[06:07] <speedo_> is ther anyone ,know how use gdesklets

[06:07] <NickGarvey> lemur: haha nice
[06:08] <funkyHat> lemur, lol
[06:08] <varsendagger> lemur, thanks
[06:08] <gnomefreak> speedo_: what do you need to know?
[06:08] <Haydre> Been getting this error message when trying to set up initial configurations: "Found fglrx primary device section
[06:08] <Haydre>  Nothing to do, terminating."
[06:08] <varsendagger> hey how do i allow a program to be run as sudo
[06:08] <NickGarvey> varsendagger: gksudo or sudo
[06:08] <speedo_> i don't want install kde
[06:08] <lemur> varsendagger, id you must run a scheduled script as root, edit root's crontab
[06:08] <speedo_> it's heavy!
[06:09] <lemur> sudo crontab -l root -e
[06:09] <speedo_> but i wish to make gnome mac osx like
[06:09] <speedo_> you know
[06:09] <speedo_> with bar
[06:09] <tag> crap this is so annoying
[06:09] <speedo_> toolbar
[06:09] <gnomefreak> speedo_: im not telling you to install it im askin what about gdesklets do you want to know
[06:09] <speedo_> and other tips
[06:09] <Haydre> speedo_: There are quite a few howtos online about making it look and feel more OSX like
[06:09] <speedo_> ok
[06:09] <speedo_> ok
[06:10] <VincentMX> is there ever going to come something like an ubuntu media center thing? It would be nice to have something using Freevo or MythTV, so you can have a user friendly kind of winmce
[06:10] <VincentMX> on linux
[06:10] <varsendagger> lemur, i know i saw a way to edit the sudousers and put a file in but i don't know how
[06:10] <gnomefreak> VincentMX: both run on linux
[06:10] <varsendagger> VincentMX, apt-get install mythtv
[06:10] <lemur> varsendagger, I just started using sudo/ubuntu last week
[06:11] <VincentMX> gnomefreak, i know, but by default
[06:11] <VincentMX> as standard interface
[06:11] <Haydre> Anyone know how to uninstall older ATI drivers? I think that might be my problem.
[06:11] <varsendagger> lemur, ubuntu is pretty killer
[06:11] <nzx> i get a segmentation fault when i run mythtv
[06:11] <lemur> varsendagger: so I would have to man sudo to catch up with you :)
[06:11] <varsendagger> maybe i should do that
[06:11] <gnomefreak> i think they are both non-free  if they are non-free no
[06:12] <lol> boa tarde
[06:12] <lemur> varsendagger: are you you sure you need to sudo?
[06:12] <lol> olaaaa?
[06:12] <EmxBA> hi again!
[06:12] <NickGarvey> !es
[06:12] <ubotu> Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
[06:12] <lemur> each user has his/her own crontab

[06:17] <lemur> yeah, that sounds right
[06:18] <varsendagger> nzx yeah if you do export EDITOR=vi
[06:18] <lemur> i made my resolv.conf unwritable
[06:18] <lemur> because I run my own nameserver and don't want dhclient to hose it
[06:18] <lemur> actuall i flagged it immutable
[06:18] <nzx> varsendagger, i use vi
[06:19] <lemur> but it is not on linux
[06:19] <ompaul> lemur, "format" does not respect the immutable tag :)
[06:19] <varsendagger> lemur, i tried that somehow and i broke my system    then i tried to edit the dhcp   and i broke my system

[06:19] <gholias> h3sp4wn, sorry dude, a problem here, Im back
[06:19] <varsendagger> ( i just learned thi one 15 minutes ago
[06:20] <Thinjon100> Hey, I'm running Dapper 6.06, with an nVidia card.  I had my system running well with the nVidia drivers downloaded/compiled from their site, with twinview and all configured... I attempted to follow the HOWTO on installing compiz/xgl, but it caused my X server never to load (some errors with GL libraries)... I've since removed the modifications mentioned in the HOWTO, but now every time I boot, my X server fails to start, and I have to re
[06:20] <Thinjon100> -run the nVidia driver installation program... any ideas?
[06:20] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  did you saw the network info?
[06:20] <lemur> ompaul :)
[06:20] <varsendagger> nzx    in a console do crontab   -e
[06:20] <varsendagger> nzx   if you didn't do the EDITOR=vi then it may go to emac
[06:21] <Napoleon> Thinjon100: just an idea, but have you reconfigured xorg-xserver yet?
[06:21] <lemur> or worse, nano
[06:21] <AngryElf> /dev/ttyS0 = com1 and if it exists than the kernel has detected the port right?
[06:21] <nzx> varsendagger, i dont have emacs installed, i dont think
[06:21] <lol> ubotu um quando entrei no canal disse beleza lol
[06:21] <ubotu> lol: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[06:21] <lemur> nzx then it might use nano
[06:21] <lol> hahaha
[06:21] <varsendagger> so then type    @reboot /path/to/file
[06:21] <h3sp4wn> gholias: yes I did yes (try this : remove the line from the bottom of /etc/modprobe.d/aliases - and try rebooting the machine with the onboard ethernet disabled in the bios (I just want to see whether its detected properly then or there is a conflict between the two drivers))
[06:22] <varsendagger> i just don't know how to use nano
[06:22] <Thinjon100> Napoleon, I haven't done anything that explicitly mentions that, forgive me if I'm a bit naive, but is that just modifying the xorg.conf file? Because I checked that... or is there something else I should be looking at?
[06:22] <lemur> hey, i've seen that before :)
=== lol is now known as ubun
[06:22] <ompaul> lemur, this (debian style) has one serious difference between it and most other versions of the world, if you install something then we assume you want to run it, so unless it needs lots of TLC to get right it is launched, so turning off dhclient by using system administration networking, you can set a static ip then you can set all the other options
[06:22] <Napoleon> Thinjon100: correct, it modifies xorg.conf
[06:22] <Napoleon> but it might be worth a try to see what it does
[06:23] <nzx> varsendagger, ok done, just save and reboot ?
[06:23] <varsendagger> yeah i think so
[06:23] <SZF> anyone got a linwksys wireless-b usb dongle?
[06:23] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  ill try this
[06:23] <gholias> hold on
[06:23] <nzx> varsendagger, and will this run everythime i load my machine ?
[06:23] <Thinjon100> Napoleon: the nVidia installation program modifies xorg.conf as its last step, and that's normally what gets X working, (after the install script, I run startx and it works) what puzzles me is why when I reboot, it doesn't work again
[06:23] <lemur> ompaul: yes, i've certainly seen that aspect of debian.  I've been using debian for about 3 months.
[06:23] <varsendagger> nzx   i think so
[06:24] <nzx> varsendagger, ok thanks alot, gonna reboot and check
[06:24] <ubun> ubotu gosto dela ou dele no sei como se chama
[06:24] <nzx> brb, fingers crossed

[06:24] <lemur> ompaul: but I was commenting about a freebsd system to varsendagger to show that I understood what he was trying to do
[06:24] <ompaul> ack

[06:25] <lemur> ok, duty calls, i must fix this rehat box that is out of disk space :)
[06:25] <wubrgamer> is it safe for me to install grub on an XFS partition ?

[06:47] <NickGarvey> wubrgamer: I did desktop cd, worked fine for me
[06:47] <h3sp4wn> varsemdagger: It will be when an interface goes up dhclient will reset it

[06:47] <EmxBA> wubrgamer: for what do you need dapper? desktop or server? choose
[06:47] <Frogzoo> can anyone recommend me a decent dicionary with a nice friendly user interface?

[06:58] <EmxBA>   wubrgamer: what do you realy want? explain it. do you want to install dapper or what?
[06:59] <h3sp4wn> gholias: You have to have it set correctly in /etc/network/interfaces or else it won't forward traffic
[06:59] <gholias> h3sp4wn, on the windows machine, i put the ip 192.068.0.2 and the gateway 192.168.0.1 (ubuntu server)
[06:59] <h3sp4wn> gholias: And its working now ?

[07:00] <h3sp4wn> gholias: Well you haven't changed /etc/network/interfaces then pastebin it
[07:00] <EmxBA> wubrgamer: i assume you know that default installation is the one using espresso
[07:00] <Healot> wubrgamer: the INSTALL CD
[07:00] <tortanick> hi all
[07:00] <jaroslav> this issue makes it impossible to start the computer at all, I had to remove 'coin-battery'
[07:00] <h3sp4wn> gholias: You will have to also set the dns servers manually for the windows machine
[07:00] <Healot> not the LiveCD
[07:01] <wubrgamer> aack, there are three online, a) desktop cd, b) server c) alternative........
[07:01] <wubrgamer> which one
[07:01] <EmxBA> wubrgamer: if you use LiveCD you'll must use espresso
[07:01] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  yes, I put the same ip from ubuntu dhcp conection, right?
[07:01] <EmxBA> if you choose install, than you can install it trough old installation
[07:01] <h3sp4wn> gholias: No
[07:02] <hunt0r> how can I prevent the bootstrap system from the live cd to load module?
[07:02] <wubrgamer> right, i'll just use the server install and rape servers for the bandwith i need to install ubuntu-desktop
[07:02] <tortanick> really simple question, dose Gedit's highlighting work well with python?
[07:02] <wubrgamer> later
[07:02] <minimouse> hello, please i need some help with software raid on ubuntu. ubuntu installer doens't recognize the hard drive at all (partitioner doesn't show any disks or partitions). laptop is toshiba portege S100 with 80GB RAID0 hard drive. Matter is very urgent.

[07:03] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  http://pastebin.com/741386
[07:04] <HotDrive> the RestrictedFormats didn't help much... a lot of packages where not found...
=== varsendagger is now known as varsendaggr
[07:04] <Healot> HotDrive: will I start kicking ass, by saying "install vlc"?
[07:04] <h3sp4wn> gholias: Which interface is the cable connection now and which is the lan ?
[07:04] <NickGarvey> !tell HotDrive about easyubuntu
[07:05] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  eth0 - cable modem   eth1- lan
[07:05] <HotDrive> what is vlc and how do I install it?
[07:05] <visik7> will easyubuntu suitable also for dappe ?
[07:05] <NickGarvey> visik7: yessir
[07:05] <h3sp4wn> gholias: How can that be you just said eth0 and eth2 were detected
[07:05] <serp> HotDrive: vlc is a media player. you install it by typing sudo apt-get install vlc
[07:05] <Healot> HotDrive: vlc is a pipeline
[07:05] <varsendaggr> hey how do i register a nick   i coan't find it in /help
[07:05] <shaun_> <~~ using vmware to setup web server for finace's website... anyone care to help a poor frustrated guy out? (ubuntu/apache2/sql)
[07:06] <Flannel> varsendaggr: /msg nickserv help register
[07:06] <HotDrive> is it any different from xine?
[07:06] <serp> shaun_: why are using vmware for that?
[07:06] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  sorryyyy
[07:06] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  eth0 - cable modem   eth2- lan
[07:06] <HotDrive> a lot of ppl told me to install mplayer but the system tells me that it's not on the repositories...
[07:06] <h3sp4wn> gholias: So they are still plugged in the same way ? the cables ?
[07:07] <HunterZ> hi
[07:07] <Healot> HotDrive: follow the next link
[07:07] <shaun_> serp,  my machine runs xp.  i dont have a second
[07:07] <Healot> !repos
[07:07] <ubotu> To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
[07:07] <gholias> h3sp4wn, yes
[07:07] <visik7> HotDrive: you need to enable universe and multiverse
[07:07] <serp> shaun_: why don't you install apache on windows?
[07:07] <visik7> why universe and multiverse aren't enabled by default ?
[07:07] <corey> how can i set a partition to be fully accessible for myself?
[07:07] <Smirnov> How do I setup my root password and is there a webpage for new ubuntu users ?
[07:07] <mjr> visik7, because they are not supported by canonical
[07:07] <gholias> h3sp4wn, works works woerks
[07:08] <cose> hi guys can anyone tell me how to install tar.gz files ?
[07:08] <varsendaggr> Smirnov, !sudo
[07:08] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  i love you dude
[07:08] <gholias> h3sp4wn, Im dancing now
[07:08] <visik7> mjr: who cares ?
[07:08] <Healot> visik7: because you only have the CD or base repos on first install, hence no other repos
[07:08] <shaun_> serp: from my very limited understanding a webserver had to be from a seperate computer for hosting issues
[07:08] <Flannel> visik7: so, they might break things.
[07:08] <visik7> ask to enable
[07:08] <gholias> h3sp4wn, you are good
[07:08] <visik7> at install time
[07:08] <mjr> visik7, apparently you don't. Don't assume nobody else does.
[07:09] <visik7> will reduce ppl asking why software X isn't installable
[07:09] <shaun_> cos: you know those are compressed files right?
[07:09] <serp> shaun_: I don't understand. apache, mysql and php exist for both windows and *nix. why would you want to run it through vmware?
[07:09] <Napoloun> you know how you can cd .. and it goes up one dir? how do you go up two?
=== dodger_ is now known as Pesa
[07:09] <Flannel> visik7: when you're installing ubuntu/linux for the first time, do you have any idea what "universe" or "more repositories" are?
[07:09] <Smirnov> !sudo
[07:09] <ubotu> rumour has it, sudo is a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[07:09] <Eroick> I tried to uise swapon with a liveCD, but it says the device is busy. umount says that the device isnt mounted! Whats going on?
[07:09] <h3sp4wn> gholias: Glad its working (probably best to reboot to check that it survives one)
[07:09] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  yeah, hold on
[07:09] <Smirnov> i dont give a damn about sudo, i just installed Ubuntu for the first time and I can't change my Networking configuration
[07:10] <shaun_> serp:  i could have sworn that i had read that when making a webserver you need to do it from a different computer
[07:10] <HotDrive> by the way... is there a program to install themes and wallpapers?
[07:10] <lemur> varsendagger: which dhcp client are you using?
[07:10] <visik7> Flannel: obviously you shuold put the question in a simple way
[07:10] <Flannel> shaun_: nope.
[07:10] <HotDrive> I had it in 5.10 but cannot find it in 6.06... :(
[07:10] <Healot> Smirnov: not giving a damn about sudo leads you nowhere :_
[07:10] <danharibo> hello
[07:10] <cose> sorry shaun yeah i know
[07:10] <Smirnov> omg, i am not trying to login as root
[07:10] <Smirnov> i am trying to change my ocnfiguration
[07:10] <danharibo> i have a problem
[07:10] <serp> shaun_: no you don't have to
[07:10] <cose> im trying to install moblock
[07:10] <Healot> Smirnov: u don't have to!
[07:10] <lemur> shawun_  a webserver is just a program, it can run anywhere
[07:11] <danharibo> HELP!
[07:11] <lemur> shaun_  a webserver is just a program, it can run anywhere
[07:11] <Smirnov> yes its asking me for my root password
=== eno-away is now known as eno
[07:11] <Flannel> danharibo: we can't help you until you ask a question
[07:11] <lemur> smirnov: sudo is asking for YOUR password :)
[07:11] <cya> Smirnov:
[07:11] <danharibo> ok, hang on
[07:11] <Smirnov> wait, wtf
[07:11] <cose> and there are no .deb files
[07:11] <Flannel> !tell Smirnov about root
[07:11] <Smirnov> I went to System > Administration
[07:11] <Healot> wtf
[07:11] <cya> Smirnov: Some configuration files require sudo to edit.
[07:11] <danharibo> my ubuntu disc crashes when i boot
[07:11] <Smirnov> I went System > Administration > Networking
[07:12] <Flannel> Smirnov: read that page
[07:12] <Smirnov> that wasnt asking for the root pasword..?
[07:12] <lemur> sudo and gksudo ask for the user's password
[07:12] <lemur> nope, it wants your password
[07:12] <Smirnov> whats the point of that?
[07:12] <lemur> odd, eh?
[07:12] <Smirnov> i am already logged in lol
[07:12] <lemur> yes
[07:12] <Smirnov> yes considering most other distros ask you for a *root* password
[07:12] <Flannel> Smirnov: it has it's merits.
[07:12] <mrproper> How do I tar up all the dot files and directories and nothing else that are in my home dir?
[07:12] <Smirnov> so how do I change the root passwrd, sudo passwd/
[07:12] <lemur> superuser do (sudo) will run things on your behalf but it needs to know you are really you
[07:13] <Flannel> Smirnov: Read that page, it explains everything.
[07:13] <Healot> Smirnov: sudo password root, but not advised to do so
[07:13] <danharibo> I CN'T run ubuntu from its cd!
[07:13] <danharibo> its crashes
[07:13] <Flannel> danharibo: did you burn the CD yourself?
[07:13] <Healot> a good root password is actually not setting any
[07:13] <danharibo> yes
[07:13] <Flannel> danharibo: define "crash"
[07:13] <shaun_> wow,  it semes ive stayed up till 2:30 am trying to get this damn thing to work on an OS ive never used before... gg shaun :('
[07:13] <roast> mrproper: uh. something like tar cvf dotstuff.tar ~/.*
[07:13] <danharibo> after the boot up screen
[07:13] <roast> mrproper: added -j to get a bz2 or -z to get a gz
[07:13] <danharibo> it just stos
[07:13] <Smirnov> the root account is locked? I can't use su- ?
[07:13] <danharibo> *stops
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
[07:14] <Flannel> Smirnov: right.  There is NO default root password.
[07:14] <Healot> Smirnov: that's the whole point
[07:14] <danharibo> themouse don't move
[07:14] <danharibo> it just crash
[07:14] <mrproper> roast, That doesn't work.  When it gets to the regular dirs, it starts naming the directories /home/kbreit/./whatever/ which qualifies for the tar based on the regex.
[07:14] <Flannel> danharibo: does the MD5 sum of the iso match?  what speed did you burn the CD?
[07:14] <danharibo> i am unshure
[07:14] <drape> any ideas why my system is at the gdm login screen if i leave it for a while (1 hour or so)?  it just started this behavior yesterday after a reboot.
[07:15] <danharibo> how can i check its md5?
[07:15] <lemur> varsendagger: ping
[07:15] <MorbidHunger> what should i use for my del dj?
[07:15] <signature16> does anybody know how to access the numberpad on this keyboard?  http://www.pc84.com/peijian/keyboard/IBM/ibm%20t30.jpg
[07:15] <drape> danharibo: md5sum <file>
[07:15] <Smirnov> interesting.. i have been wanting to use sudo more
[07:16] <MorbidHunger> how do i transfer muysic to my dell dj
[07:16] <roast> mrproper: that's ... true.
[07:16] <Paavo> NickGarvey, Healot: I tried the CD in another CD drive in the same machine, and with that the integrity check passed, and the system booted just fine. Apparently the other burner is bad.
[07:16] <mrproper> roast, Thus, why I ask the question.
[07:16] <tmroland> hi
[07:16] <Smirnov> Oooh, ubuntu has hibernate? fancy
[07:16] <tmroland> ubuntu can run on a cray supercomputer ?
[07:16] <tmroland> with opteron
[07:17] <Smirnov> Now how the hell do I change my desktop resolution so its not 60 Hz and hurtig my eyes, it wont let me pick 85 HZ!
[07:17] <roast> mrproper: what's odd is that if I did a \.*, bash interpolates it correctly, but tar doesn't
[07:17] <h3sp4wn> tmroland: use the server-bigiron kernel
[07:17] <roast> mrproper: like... ls \.*
[07:17] <mrproper> roast, Bug in tar?
[07:17] <danharibo> ?
[07:17] <roast> mrproper: could be, but it'll be a very iffy subject to bring up
[07:17] <kaye> oi oi
[07:17] <danharibo> md5sum <file> ?
[07:17] <Healot> Paavo: told you so
[07:17] <danharibo> where?
[07:17] <mrproper> roast, tar -cvzf foo.tar.gz `ls \.*`
[07:18] <kaye> who is can-oworms
[07:18] <NickGarvey> Paavo: :) good
[07:18] <roast> mrproper: wait.
[07:18] <NickGarvey> Paavo: well not good, but at least it makes sense
[07:18] <Napoloun> you know how you can cd .. and it goes up one dir? how do you go up two?
[07:18] <tmroland> cd ../..
[07:18] <roast> mrproper: it's the '.' that matches everything
[07:19] <NickGarvey> Paavo: oh and I'd like to remind you "(12:43:12) NickGarvey: Paavo: try the integ check in another computer?"
[07:19] <roast> mrproper: or, everything /else/ that doesn't lead with the .
[07:19] <NickGarvey> kidding kidding
[07:19] <hanuma> hai, iam a newbie to ubuntu
[07:19] <hanuma> i am using apt-get
[07:19] <NickGarvey> hanuma: what can I do for you?
[07:19] <mrproper> roast, What if I do an inverse regex on [a-z]  and [A-Z] 
[07:19] <NickGarvey> s/I/we/
[07:19] <lemur> doh, i've been typing the wrong name this whole time
[07:19] <Paavo> It's apparently making random errors since the MD5 sums matched when checked manually and the whole image sum matched when checked with K3B.
[07:19] <cya> Get ready, the mother ship is arriving soon!
[07:19] <Krpano> guys, just installed Ubuntu and i would like to know what do i need to install to listen to my MP3s ?

[07:21] <mrproper> Smirnov, Google for the specs  on your monitor and set those refresh rates up instead of what comes with the regular one.
[07:21] <varsendaggr> lemsx1, sorry i jsut changed my name, DHCP clinet   what's that?   i just start my computer and everhting works
[07:21] <mrproper> Smirnov, Edit X11 configs

[07:22] <Smirnov> I have a CRT
[07:22] <mrproper> Smirnov, ls /etc/X*
[07:22] <hzuazaga> mrproper try .?*
[07:22] <lemur> varsendaggr: i'm assuming that it's dhcp client that is clobbering your resolv.conf
[07:22] <tmroland> is there any virtualization solution for PowerPC Ubuntu that allows me to run another Ubuntu or Linux instance inside the host OS? any package?
[07:23] <maxkelley> Smirnov: are you sure you're using it case-sensitive?
[07:23] <mrproper> hzuazaga, Give me a few minutes, lets see what it picks up.
[07:23] <lemur> tmroland vmware.com
[07:23] <varsendaggr> yeah    i'm over it
[07:23] <lemur> oh, cool
[07:23] <maxkelley> it can't be /etc/x11, it has to be /etc/X11
[07:23] <varsendaggr> lemur,   i really appreciate your help
[07:23] <roast> hzuazaga: that ... does weird things for me, like going into ../
[07:23] <Smirnov> ok I found /etc/X11
[07:23] <hanuma>  i want to install beta versions thorugh apt,but presently througmy apt configurationfiles i am able to install only stable versions,can anybody help me out
[07:23] <njan> tmroland, doesn't xen support powerpc?
[07:23] <mrproper> Smirnov, See, would I lie?
[07:23] <tmroland> vmware doesnt support powerpc
[07:23] <mrproper> roast, Yeah, I'm getting .. as well
[07:23] <cya> "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[07:23] <Smirnov> yeah I mispelled etc
[07:23] <Flannel> hanuma: gksudo "update-manager -d" at a gnome-terminal, should set you up.
[07:23] <Smirnov> ok i'm looking at it
[07:23] <lemur> tmroland oh, what about parallels
[07:24] <roast> mrproper: it picked up .. bah :)
[07:24] <Smirnov> its got all this weird vertical and horizontal refreshes though
[07:24] <mrproper> Smirnov, You need to get the specs on your monitor first.
[07:24] <issaker> what is the difference between gksudo and sudo?
[07:24] <varsendaggr> lemsx1,  h3sp4wn, helped me fixit  with a hack
[07:24] <cya> Smirnov: Or re-run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[07:24] <tmroland> parallel runs only on intel core duo mac os x
[07:24] <Flannel> issaker: gksudo is for gnome/graphical stuff
[07:24] <mrproper> roast, Harder problem than you'd think, huh?
[07:24] <lemur> er, let me reread the question :)
[07:24] <MorbidHunger> is there like an app for it?
[07:24] <cya> Smirnov: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and select the appropriate resolutions near the last step.
[07:24] <issaker> flannel, what would happen if i use sudo to run graphical stuff?
[07:24] <roast> mrproper: but... ~/.[^\.] * works here
[07:24] <Flannel> issaker: sometimes it can screw things up.
[07:24] <roast> mrproper: yea, this is a lot harder than I thought :)
[07:25] <lemur> issaker use gksudo
[07:25] <cya> issaker: It will also not use your normal home directory.
[07:25] <issaker> actually im more asking why it happens as to what happens
[07:25] <roast> mrproper: it's tougher too because I remember those .'s and ..'s made my life easier before. they're just being a pain today
[07:25] <cya> issaker: Possibly because it will attempt to find stuff in the root home directory that doesn't exist.
[07:25] <issaker> ah ok
[07:25] <lemur> issaker sudo will run a program that may not beable to access your display
[07:25] <cya> issaker: /home/(user)/.* are where a lot of config files are.
[07:26] <mrproper> roast, I'm running that expression now.  Give me a few minutes and we'll see what happens.
[07:26] <Healot> issaker: that's where gksudo comes
[07:26] <lemur> issaker so the graphical stuff cannot be shown
[07:26] <hzuazaga> ls .?* > file then tar -T file
[07:26] <Healot> or kdesu for KDE users
[07:26] <roast> mrproper: alright
[07:27] <roast> hzuazaga: I replaced your .? with a .[^\.] , because .? matches .. :)
[07:27] <shaun_> Anyone care to help me out?  Installing apache2 now from XP and its asking for a server name.... I dont have a server.
[07:27] <NickGarvey> shaun_: I'd try #apache or #windows
[07:27] <issaker> whats an example of a graphical program?
[07:27] <blank> !root
[07:27] <ubotu> Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[07:27] <Healot> shaun_: it is the name of your server that you want to create
[07:27] <NickGarvey> shaun_: unless you mean you are in a ssh connection
[07:27] <issaker> that has to be run with gksudo
[07:28] <roryy> issaker: synaptic
[07:28] <cya> You can always run sudo -i
[07:28] <cya> That way, no need to keep typing it.
[07:28] <issaker> whats the -i arguemnt do?
[07:28] <shaun_> NickGarvey: I believe i need to setup an ssh connection
[07:28] <NickGarvey> shaun_: are you on ubuntu rgiht now?
[07:28] <shaun_> yes Nick
[07:28] <Hexidigital_> cya:: how long does that last for? for the session?
[07:29] <cya> Hexidigital_: I believe so.
[07:29] <NickGarvey> shaun_: oh I thought you said you were in xp
[07:29] <Hexidigital_> cool... i learned something new today :)
[07:29] <shaun_> NickGarvey: I am running Xp currently with Ubuntu in vmware
[07:29] <Flannel> shaun_: why not just install apache on ubuntu?  It'll have fewer problems.
[07:30] <Smirnov> I reran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, how do I get it to show me the new resolutions?
[07:30] <Hexidigital_> shaun_:: you should run Ubuntu, with Windows in VMWare
[07:30] <mrproper> roast, I think it's working okay.  We'll see.
[07:30] <cya> shaun_: Why not dual-boot Linux and Windows?
[07:30] <tmroland> can xen run on ppc64?
[07:30] <Healot> shaun_ likes that
[07:30] <shaun_> Flannel: thats what i stayed up till 2:30am trying to do.    Care to help me with ubuntu/ apache2 install flannel?
[07:30] <cya> shaun_: I would imagine that VMWare takes a big chunk out of performance for both OS's.
[07:30] <Flannel> shaun_: sure.
[07:30] <roast> mrproper: okay. I tried the regexp with ls to see if the shell interpolated it correctly. if you're really worried, you could try that too.
[07:30] <Hajuu> hiyas all! I have a problem.. Ive downloaded quite a few audio applications.. but I cant get the Jack audio server to work... Its installed, but I dont think its running and dont know how to get it running..
[07:30] <Hajuu> anyone know?
[07:31] <roast> mrproper: and oddly enough, irssi isn't highlighting lines that start with "roast, " :P
[07:31] <mrproper> roast: What about now?
[07:31] <roast> mrproper: yay :)
[07:31] <mrproper> roast: You're having all sorts of string matching problems with me, aren't you?
[07:31] <roast> mrproper: it's probably a configuration property anyway
=== zaydana is now known as zayd[a] na
[07:31] <roast> mrproper: yes, heh
[07:31] <mrproper> roast: Tell irssi it sucks because it can't detect your name with a comma.
[07:31] <Flannel> shaun_: you're using breezy?
[07:31] <roast> mrproper: bah :P
[07:31] <Flannel> mrproper: except, it can.  He's just got problems.
=== nalioth_zZz is now known as noirequus
[07:31] <shaun_> i believe so
[07:31] <cya> Chatzilla here :D
[07:32] <Flannel> shaun_: alright, so, what's you're preferred method of installing things? synaptic, I imagine?
[07:32] <issaker> is there any suggestion to graphics card drivers? VESA doesnt seem to redraw stuff very smoothly
[07:32] <Smirnov> oh my god
[07:32] <Smirnov> it shows the 1600x1200  now
[07:32] <cya> issaker: What graphics card?
[07:32] <Smirnov> but I can't change it to 85 Hz!!!!
=== corey is now known as uscg_corey
[07:32] <issaker> xfx 7600 gt
[07:32] <Hexidigital_> Flannel:: wouldn't it be easier to walk shaun_ through with aptitude?
[07:32] <shaun_> Flannel:  So far I have installed ubuntu,   installed apache2, installed sql, and installed php.   I can test php and sql working.  Just dont knwo whwere to go from there
[07:33] <g-nome> is there anywhere a nice list with useful tar commands, or a tutorial about creating tar archives with all the needed options?
[07:33] <mrproper> Smirnov, Seriously, edit the files by yourself.
[07:33] <g-nome> (not only tar --help)
[07:33] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: I don't see how that would help any more than through synaptic.
[07:33] <roast> mrproper: should be okay now..
[07:33] <cya> g-nome: man tar gives more detail.
[07:33] <frank_> !shaun
[07:33] <roryy> g-nome: tried 'info tar' ?
[07:33] <Flannel> shaun_: alright, so, all you need is the apache modules, it seems.
[07:33] <ubotu> I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, frank_
[07:33] <cya> !tar
[07:33] <Sweet_kate> hello!!

[07:33] <ubotu> Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, one of the standard internet server installations. Installing LAMP in Ubuntu is fairly straightforward. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[07:33] <shaun_> Flannel: agreed
[07:33] <LinuxJones> Sweet_kate, welcome sweety :)
[07:33] <Hexidigital_> Flannel:: n/m... i thought he needed those programs installed. sorry
[07:33] <mrproper> I am going to run.  I'll talk to you guys later.
[07:34] <mrproper> Thanks for your help roast.
[07:34] <Sweet_kate> how can i "load" my printer on kubuntu now  that i have started the pc with it turned off??
[07:34] <Flannel> Hexidigital_: still, I don't see how forcing command line on anyone will help, when the graphical tools work just as well.
[07:34] <Flannel> shaun_: alright, so, in synaptic (or do you use somethig else?) search for apache2-mod
[07:34] <Flannel> shaun_: it'll make the list a lot shorter
[07:34] <LinuxJones> Sweet_kate, you can configure you printer by doing sudo gnome-cups-manager (enter your user password) in terminal
[07:35] <shaun_> Flannel: just tell me where to go and ill go
[07:35] <cya> I've always prefered apt-cache search apache2-mod
[07:35] <siccness> Using nautilus 2.12.1, how do I change the location bar to text (so I can type where i want to go, rather than have buttons)?
[07:35] <Phopsy> Hey, thanks to anyone who helped me out yesterday, the HDD is now working as it should be :D
[07:35] <Hajuu> hiyas all! I have a problem.. Ive downloaded quite a few audio applications.. but I cant get the Jack audio server to work... Its installed, but I dont think its running and dont know how to get it running..
[07:35] <Hajuu> anyone know?
[07:35] <paul_> Yo I got all da ubuntu problems solved on my pc I am proud to day especially for someone new to linux. woohoo
[07:35] <shaun_> Flannel: I always just go to "Add Application"
[07:35] <Smirnov> Guys can anyone tell me why I can't change my refresh rate to 85 Hz
[07:35] <LinuxJones> Sweet_kate, oh sorry your on Kubuntu I don't know in that case
[07:36] <Flannel> shaun_: alright, we're looking for libapache2-mod-php5 to add php5 to apache
[07:36] <Sweet_kate> LinuxJones: how 'd u do on ubuntu?
[07:36] <g-nome> i mean having to remember tar xvdfkzktro is not verty easy
[07:36] <Flannel> shaun_: and then to link php and mysql, the package is php5-mysql
[07:36] <eugman> Is lmms in the rops?
[07:36] <siccness> heheh, g-nome .
[07:36] <eugman> Is lmms in the repos?
[07:36] <LinuxJones> Sweet_kate, using gnome-cups-manager but you don't use Gnome you use kde
[07:37] <Sweet_kate> and what d u do on that mnanager
[07:37] <Sweet_kate> ?^?
[07:37] <cya> tar xjvf for tar.bz2 | tar zxvf for tar.gz
[07:37] <Sweet_kate> what acxtions?
=== jack- is now known as jack
[07:38] <cya> Sweet_kate: Try #kubuntu
[07:39] <Flannel> shaun_: and, actually, there's a full fledged guide for this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[07:39] <Smirnov> Any suggestions for why I can't switch monitor refresh rate to 85 Hz? the 60 Hz is hurting my eyes
[07:39] <Flannel> shaun_: that'll tell you the rest of what you have to do.  Much easier than me retyping it.
[07:39] <g-nome> does the order play a role for tar, is tarr xfv same as xvf ?
[07:39] <xophEr> Is the evdev driver issue being looked at? Ubuntu cannot detect my mx500's side buttons at all..

[07:40] <shaun_> Flannel: installed the programs you asked.  Thanks for the site!
[07:40] <roryy> !tell Smirnov about fixres
[07:40] <lemur> Smirnov: you have to change that in your /etc/X11/xorg.cong
[07:40] <Krpano> anyone using Opera9 with Dapper ?
[07:40] <lemur> Smirnov: you have to change that in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[07:40] <NickGarvey> danharibo: need a bit more information then that
[07:40] <Smirnov> Man I thought Ubuntu was supposed to be more userfriendly than fedora
[07:40] <danharibo> but when it gets to the ubuntu screen it crashes
[07:40] <joshdoe> And need to have 2 very basic questions answered.
[07:40] <joshdoe> Can anyoine help or is this just for experts?
[07:40] <Flannel> Krpano: #ubuntu+1 for dapper things
[07:40] <cya> Smirnov: It is very user-friendly.  The advantage is also the friendly and helpful community.
[07:40] <Krpano> thanks
[07:40] <NickGarvey> joshdoe: ask away
[07:41] <joshdoe> THANKS!
[07:41] <lemur> Smirnov: My ubuntu set my monitor at 85
[07:41] <cya> Smirnov: I think the Ubuntu community is the best out of the distros I have used.
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: this is a support channel
[07:41] <eugman> !ask
[07:41] <ubotu> For information on how to ask good questions please see http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html The more information you can give the better we can help you. If your going to give output of commands please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: feel free to ask your question
[07:41] <joshdoe> I want to setup it up as a bootable ISO and I don't know which version to use, live or regualr iso
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> regular
[07:41] <Hexidigital_> wait... to install?
[07:42] <lemur> Smirnov:  Click System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution
[07:42] <Hexidigital_> or to run without installing?
[07:42] <eugman> +p Live you can but a live instance off of.
[07:42] <danharibo> but when it gets to the ubuntu screen it crashes
[07:42] <eugman> REgular is for installation.
[07:42] <Smirnov> yes I did that and it only lets me select 60hz
=== jack is now known as jack-
[07:42] <andrejkw> Hello
[07:42] <Flannel> danharibo: What speed did you burn the ISO at?
=== eno is now known as eno-away
[07:42] <danharibo> im not shure
[07:42] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: do you want to install Ubuntu on your hard disc?
[07:42] <andrejkw> ANybody in here running engage on Ubuntu with Gnome?
[07:42] <NickGarvey> joshdoe: you don't know how to burn the cd?
[07:43] <MorbidHunger> wats a good c compiler?
[07:43] <itay> gcc
[07:43] <andrejkw> I can get the applications to maximize and minimize.
[07:43] <Flannel> danharibo: you might want to go back, and burn it slower.  That's a fairly common problem with modern CD writers.
[07:43] <joshdoe> Is regular bootable?
[07:43] <lemur> Smirnov:  That most likely means that ubuntu may be using the wrong video card driver for your setup or it cannot determine the abilities of your monitor
[07:43] <danharibo> ok
[07:43] <joshdoe> What is the live version?
[07:43] <Flannel> joshdoe: liveCD is bootable.
[07:43] <eugman> +p anyone here have lmms installed?
[07:43] <mgedmin> they're both bootable
[07:43] <joshdoe> Yes I have 20 years pc, amiga, commodore experience
[07:43] <mgedmin> but you won't get a desktop on the regular version, just a text-mode installer
[07:43] <Flannel> I imagine he means 'bootable to an OS'
[07:43] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: live will run Ubuntu without affecting the information on your hard drive (windows intall, etc)
[07:44] <lemur> joshdoe: my first pc was a c-64
[07:44] <njan> <= Tandy TRS-80 200

[07:44] <Smirnov> "Microprocessor-based 30 to 121 kHz auto-scan range;  " what does that mean
[07:44] <njan> lemur, the model 200 rocked :)
[07:44] <joshdoe> Best machine
[07:44] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: you want regular
[07:44] <joshdoe> Loved it to death
[07:44] <joshdoe> ok thanks guys, you really are a friendly community
[07:45] <shaun_> installing mysql,  should I pick "Internet Site" or "Internet Site with smart host"??
[07:45] <rysiek|brb> joshdoe: ?
[07:45] <joshdoe> I forgot one last question
[07:45] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: wasn't there a second question?
[07:45] <njan> joshdoe, welcome to ubuntu! :)

[07:45] <_luksss> when Dapper Drake will be released ?
[07:45] <NickGarvey> !dapper
[07:45] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[07:45] <itay> did someone succeed to compile kernel 2.6.12 i2c modules with gcc 4 ?
[07:45] <AndreH> hi, a friend of mine just downloaded "6.06 RC desktop" and wants to install it, but every time the screen turns blank when the graphical installer is about to start. a warning message in Xorg.log says: "(WW) (1280*1024) mode clock 157.5 Mhz exceeds DDC Maximum 140 Mhz"
[07:45] <lemur> axxxa: no that means run it the first minute of every hour of every day
[07:45] <AndreH> what does it mean?
[07:45] <lemur> axxxa change the 1 to a *
[07:46] <joshdoe> I need to install the raid array drivers for it to detect the raid.  Can I patch them onto the install cd
[07:46] <axxxa> lemur, ah thanx!
[07:46] <AndreH> is there a way to use a text based setup just like in "the old days"?
[07:46] <frank_> itay: if you compile modules for breezy you need to compile them with gcc-3.4
[07:46] <danharibo> im reburning ubuntu now
[07:46] <Flannel> AndreH: #ubuntu+1 will have better luck asking.
[07:46] <itay> ok
[07:46] <Flannel> AndreH: erm, yeah.  download the "alternate" one
[07:46] <AndreH> ok thanks
[07:46] <lemur> andreh: i'm running dapper
[07:46] <itay> so i need to downgrade the currently installed gcc 4.0
[07:47] <frank_> itay: no.  just install gcc-3.4   and enter     export CC=gcc-3.4    in the shell before compiling
[07:47] <AndreH> yes I'm running it too. but my setup is a little bit older where the text based installer was available
[07:47] <NickGarvey> itay: or aptitude install gcc-3.4
[07:47] <frank_> itay: both versions will be installed at the same time
[07:47] <Kr0ntab> sup f0lks
[07:47] <itay> So this is how i make gcc3.4 to the active version
[07:47] <itay> thank you!
[07:47] <NickGarvey> !gcc
[07:47] <ubotu> gcc is probably the GNU project C and C++ compiler.  From the command-line, type "man gcc" for a complete manual on gcc.  You can install gcc with 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
[07:47] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: stick around for an answer... i know nothing about sata raids, but i'm sure someone here does
[07:47] <NickGarvey> eh nothing on 3.4
[07:47] <dubious9> hey all.  I don't know if there are a whole lot of ubuntu devs in here, but I just installed the Dapper RC, and WOW.  Thanks for all the hard work.

[07:54] <andrejkw> I can't get the applications to maximize and minimize.
[07:54] <Smirnov> Not so much tricky as the Network Settings utility can be more elaborate
[07:54] <frank_> Smirnov: because programs are generaly not updated within a ubuntu version
[07:55] <frank_> Smirnov: dapper has Firefox 1.5.3
[07:55] <Harold_P> 1.5.0.3
[07:55] <njan> Smirnov, firefox 1.5 has too many dependencies to easily backport to breezy.

[08:10] <[NP] Tangent> I fixed my wireless issues
[08:10] <mehmet> r0xoR: i dont have links

[08:58] <mrDaniel> general question: is ubuntu 6.06 or kubuntu 6.06 to suggest?
[08:59] <Deft> mrDaniel: you mean, which would we suggest?
[08:59] <BlueLaguna> mrDaniel: wait a week or so, they're currently release candidates
[08:59] <mrDaniel> yes
[08:59] <BlueLaguna> do you prefer kde or gnome?
[08:59] <mrDaniel> more kde than gnome
[08:59] <BlueLaguna> kubuntu
[08:59] <mrDaniel> but i am not sure, because
[09:00] <mrDaniel> it seems, that ubuntu is more evolved than kubuntu
[09:00] <gnomefreak> mrDaniel: install one and sudo apt-get install the other one :) run them on same hd
[09:00] <KyoLptp`> Hey, uh
[09:00] <gnomefreak> mrDaniel: they are about the same
[09:00] <BlueLaguna> mrDaniel: they're the exact same thing...
[09:00] <reghla2Mo> anyone know how I can logon to my ubuntu server remotely?
[09:00] <KyoLptp`> How do I obtain "aclocal-1.6?"
[09:00] <linchris> hi.. I got a problem.. I cant read/write to a mounted disk.. :(
[09:00] <JonathanKent> !serach limewire
[09:00] <ubotu> Huh? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, JonathanKent
[09:00] <linchris> :)
[09:00] <reghla2Mo> or from a windows box
[09:00] <BlueLaguna> mrDaniel: only difference is between KDE and GNOME
[09:00] <JonathanKent> !limewire
[09:00] <ubotu> first you need !java, then download the http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and unpack it. Then just run the runLime.sh file. Voila. Consider !frostwire as an alternative.
[09:00] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: install graphical or command line?
[09:00] <F0LL0W3R> is there anyprog for Extracting Rar files instead of unrar-free ?
[09:01] <zsh> gnomefreak: removing the country code didnt work. can i put a different country code like uk
[09:01] <Deft> reghla2Mo: to a console or a desktop
[09:01] <linchris> fstab says /dev/sda1 	/storage/infinite-master 	ext3    auto,user,exec,rw 0       2
[09:01] <reghla2Mo> its a command line server
[09:01] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: forget "install"
[09:01] <gnomefreak> zsh: yes
[09:01] <linchris> what have I done wrong?
[09:01] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: did you install the openssh package on the server?
[09:01] <gnomefreak> zsh: did you get rid of the . after the cc also?
[09:01] <reghla2Mo> i think so, i have apache
[09:02] <mrDaniel> i know, that ubuntu and kubuntu are the same, except the desktop (gnome or kde), but they have differnt progs
[09:02] <linchris> FOLLOW3R: unrar :)
[09:02] <reghla2Mo> doesnt mean i have openssh, but i thought installed it when i put apache2 on
[09:02] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: apache is not intertwined w/ ssh... are you in front of your server now?
[09:02] <reghla2Mo> yes
[09:02] <h3sp4wn> mrDaniel: You can just install both kubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop and then you have all of both
[09:02] <mrDaniel> and i think, that kde has more and better software than gnome
[09:02] <BlueLaguna> mrDaniel: ubuntu uses gnome programs, kubuntu uses kde programs
[09:02] <F0LL0W3R> <linchris> i tried unrar but isnt workin didnt know why
[09:02] <BlueLaguna> mrDaniel: ...then what's the problem?
[09:02] <BlueLaguna> just use Kubuntu...
[09:02] <gnomefreak> you can miox the apps run kde apps ong nome and vice versa
[09:02] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: in terminal (of remote computer) type in terminal "ssh my.remote.server" without quotes
[09:03] <linchris> FOLOW3R: it works for me..
[09:03] <gnomefreak> s/miox/mix   s/nome/gnome
[09:03] <BlueLaguna> gnomefreak: I'm assuming he means the apps that come with the default desktop installation
[09:03] <mrDaniel> i know that i can install ubuntu (with gnome) and than install kubuntu-desktop, but i am not sure, if there is an differnce between a pure kubuntu
[09:03] <F0LL0W3R> <linchris> ic thats why am askin for a program instead of it
[09:03] <tubbie> !limewire
[09:03] <reghla2Mo> Hexidigital_: it says ssh: my.remote.server: Name or service not known
[09:03] <ubotu> first you need !java, then download the http://www.limewire.com/LimeWireSoftOther and unpack it. Then just run the runLime.sh file. Voila. Consider !frostwire as an alternative.
[09:03] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: one second please
[09:03] <gnomefreak> BlueLaguna: its the same kubuntu-desktop is all kubuntu is
[09:03] <BlueLaguna> !frostwire
[09:03] <ubotu> well, frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo

=== HellDragon` is now known as HellDragon`Blend
[09:16] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: I used /kb syntax instead of /ban syntax (which takes a reason). "Troll" took the tr ;-)
[09:16] <Hexidigital_> perceptualchaos:: you have to tell us your problem first
[09:16] <minimouse> anyone know why ubuntu live cd is not showing anything but a background and cursor after preparing the live session?

[09:16] <perceptualchaos> I'm having trouble installing a program on Ubuntu (xchm). when I run the configure scripts, It says I need to have wxwidgets > 2.3.4 and specifically, its looking for wx-config. I looked in Synaptic and I have libwxgtk2.6-0 installed but I can't find any wx-config or libwx-config or anything. Can someone here please give me a hand?
[09:16] <igorzolnikov> what is "fakeroot java-package"? help plz
[09:17] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: ah
[09:17] <tubbie> !java
[09:17] <ubotu> To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
[09:17] <r0xoR> perceptualchaos, that means you need the "-dev" version of it
[09:17] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: they are 2 packagges you need to install java froma bin
[09:17] <r0xoR> perceptualchaos, libnameX.X-dev
[09:17] <r0xoR> perceptualchaos, i.e. libwx6.0-dev
[09:17] <r0xoR> perceptualchaos, or whatever it's called
[09:17] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: you need to install fakeroot & java-common & java-package
[09:17] <aaron__> how do I install libdvdcss?
[09:18] <perceptualchaos> r0xoR: ok thanks, I'll try it now

[09:18] <apokryphos> nope
[09:18] <Hexidigital_> perceptualchaos:: if someone dosent answer immediately, someone may be typing, or searching for an answer
[09:18] <igorzolnikov> ok
[09:18] <Flannel> alexito-: yeah, gdesklet, its a program that allows you to run applets, applets are a variety of smaller program-ish things.  Like that monitor
[09:18] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell aaron__ about restricted

[09:19] <gnomefreak> aaron__: read that site please it will answer all your multimedia questions
[09:20] <HotDrive> aaron__ -> I used the EasyUbuntu and everything is fine now
[09:20] <aaron__> what's the easyubuntu?

[09:20] <apokryphos> aaron__: /msg ubotu easyubuntu
[09:20] <Hexidigital_> reghla2Mo:: excellent :)
[09:20] <aaron__> alright
[09:20] <gnomefreak> apokryphos: did you want to remove that person before?
[09:20] <HotDrive> I don't know the site but wait a bit...
[09:20] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: nope, just a braino when typing really.
[09:21] <apokryphos> gnomefreak: better to subject them to torture ;-)
[09:21] <gnomefreak> ah ok hes been muted here thats why i ask
[09:21] <gnomefreak> lol
[09:21] <paradizelost> hey all
[09:21] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: heya
[09:21] <HotDrive> aaron__ -> try this: http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/
[09:21] <UgzY> Hi If Mysta reads this. I talked to you yestarday about a black screen on my laptop Toshiba. Well, apparently it's a not so unsual problem with Toshiba. It's up and running again, I didn't do anything... I just let it sleep for a while... might have been exhausted! ;-) Anyway thanks again!
[09:21] <paradizelost> hey Hexidigital_
[09:22] <KyoLptp`> I think I might have figured it out...!
[09:22] <Hexidigital_> ubuntu related--> editor's note... with Ubuntu (instead of windows) on my laptop, my battery life has increased by nearly 25%
[09:23] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: have you done a vmware-server upgrade before, like when the next beta version or the final come out?
[09:23] <guerra> hail, i got this message: Your libstdc++ doesn't have the sstream or strstream classes, how can iget these classes?
=== patlkli|away is now known as patlkli
[09:23] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: no... why, is there a new updatE?
[09:23] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: there will be fairly soon, they seem to have been releasing one every few weeks
[09:24] <paradizelost> i know by the end of june that its supposed to be final
[09:24] <perceptualchaos> so I want to install something from source, so I unzipped the source tar into my /usr/src directory and am thinking I should just be able to do configure-make-install from there
[09:24] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: i dont think i have done any updates yet... (can't wait for final)
[09:24] <perceptualchaos> is that correct?
[09:24] <Hexidigital_> perceptualchaos:: sounds right
[09:25] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: basically what i usually do, suspend all vm's, then you just run through the install process w/ the new one.
[09:25] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: don't uninstall the old one, the installer will handle that for you
[09:25] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: sounds easy enough... :)  ubuntu handles the extra weight better than my previous OS
[09:26] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: although i do have to say, that workstation is much nicer for some things.  i purchased a copy back when it was 3.0, and have just got the upgrades, downside, i bought the windows version because that's what i was stuck on all the time.
[09:27] <perceptualchaos> ok now that I have clarified that just to make sure I'm not starting out on the wrong foot, I have installed the wxwidgets development packages from Synaptic and when I run the configure script I still get the following error:
[09:27] <perceptualchaos> wxWidgets must be installed on your system
[09:27] <perceptualchaos>  but the wx-config script couldn't be found.  Please check that wx-config is in path, the directory
[09:27] <perceptualchaos>  where wxWidgets libraries are installed (returned by
[09:27] <perceptualchaos>  'wx-config --libs' command) is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
[09:27] <perceptualchaos>  equivalent variable and wxWidgets version is 2.3.4 or above.
[09:27] <drape> any ideas why my system is at the gdm login screen if i leave it for a while (1 hour or so)?  it just started this behavior yesterday after a reboot.
[09:27] <paradizelost> perceptualchaos: don't flood
[09:27] <roast> drape: where was it at before you left?
[09:27] <perceptualchaos> sorry, I forget it does that. is LD_LIBRARY_PATH a variable in the configure script
[09:27] <rainer> hello
[09:27] <drape> roast: logged in, ie firefox open, terminals open
[09:28] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: have you used workstation before?
[09:28] <rainer> exit
[09:28] <roast> drape: uh. that doesn't sound good :)
[09:28] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: not on linux
[09:28] <minimouse> can somebody tell me if dapper has support for raid ?
[09:28] <drape> roast: no joke.  its not rebooting...
[09:29] <aaron__> So running easy ubuntu will change my totem player?
[09:29] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: anymore they're the same on both platforms
[09:29] <roast> drape: because the uptime is still sane?
[09:29] <gnomefreak> aaron__: nope
[09:29] <drape> roast: yep
[09:29] <KyoLptp`> heh, didn't work
[09:29] <Deft> drape: is your session still there in another terminal?
[09:29] <gnomefreak> aaron__: sudo apt-get install totem-xine
[09:29] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: it's been a while... maybe a year ago, or so
[09:29] <paradizelost> Seveas: ping
[09:29] <roast> drape: maybe X died? anything in the X logs?
[09:29] <La> what are you lot talkin about
[09:29] <drape> Deft: i'm using screen
[09:29] <paradizelost> Hexidigital_: was it in the 5. series yet?
[09:29] <KyoLptp`> guess I'll have to burn the images to DVD then transfer it them to my PC that runs the EVER-LOYALWindows
[09:29] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: yes, was just released
[09:29] <Seveas> paradizelost, ?
[09:30] <La> hello are u listening
[09:30] <paradizelost> Seveas: can i pm you?
[09:30] <Seveas> sure
[09:30] <HotDrive> aaron__: no, it adds codecs and a lot of other stuff. But its best to install a more robust player like Xine ou Mplayer
[09:30] <La> what does pm mean
[09:30] <gnomefreak> La: what can we help you with today?
[09:30] <Hexidigital_> La:: what's the problem?
[09:30] <joshdoe> Can someone help a Linux noob?
[09:30] <gnomefreak> pm= private message
[09:30] <minimouse> can somebody tell me if dapper has support for raid please?
[09:30] <gnomefreak> joshdoe: whats the issue?
[09:30] <Seveas> joshdoe, just ask 
[09:30] <La> kk
[09:30] <Flannel> minimouse: #ubuntu+1 for dapper questions
[09:30] <KyoLptp`> seveas, was that japanese? o_O
[09:30] <aaron__> Hotdrive, so you ran easyubuntu and now you use totem to play dvd's?
[09:31] <La> how do ya do a pm on this thing
[09:31] <minimouse> Flannel thanks
[09:31] <gnomefreak> minimouse: try #ubuntu+1
[09:31] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: welcome back!
[09:31] <joshdoe> I downloaded and am about to burn the ubuntu 5.10 Install cd
[09:31] <Seveas> La, this is a support channel for Ubuntu linux, no general chat channel
[09:31] <joshdoe> IS this a cd rom bootable disc?
[09:31] <joshdoe> Do i have to burn it in a special way for it to be bootable?
[09:31] <La> ok
[09:31] <HotDrive> no, but I never did... I use the Xine player.
[09:31] <NickGarvey> joshdoe: yes
[09:31] <gnomefreak> joshdoe: the iso is if you burnit as a cd image
[09:31] <invitado> hola
[09:31] <joshdoe> Will
[09:31] <joshdoe> do
[09:31] <Hexidigital_> joshdoe:: yes, you cannot burn the .iso onto a disc... you have to burn it AS a disc
[09:32] <Flannel> joshdoe: you might also think about throttling down the burn speed.
[09:32] <joshdoe> I need to install raid drivers, can I put this on another cd-rom?
[09:32] <HotDrive> Xive plays dvd, cd, and all the rest. the codecs EasyUbuntu install work for all the players
[09:32] <etsme> hi dudes
[09:32] <paradizelost> joshdoe: also, you need to make sure your burner isn't going outl.
[09:32] <La> my enter net keeps on puting up  these error signs what does it mean
[09:32] <etsme> i have a question
[09:32] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: most of us do.... go ahead and ask
[09:32] <gnomefreak> La: ask in ubuntu-offtopic please
[09:32] <paradizelost> i've had burners on the way out, that can read their own cd's but other machines cannot read them properly
[09:33] <etsme> i have two options, one is to go with p3 1.0ghz and 256mb ram
[09:33] <joshdoe> Or MUSTwhat is outl?
[09:33] <HotDrive> to see DVD's on Totem or any other you have to install libdvdcss2
[09:33] <joshdoe> outer tracks?
[09:33] <mdweil> Can anyone help!! with getting network access on Ubuntu?  SLAX works
[09:33] <aaron__> so what one do you use?
[09:33] <etsme> and the other one is to go with p3 1.13ghz and 256mb ram for ubuntu
[09:33] <gnomefreak> joshdoe: burn it as a cd image you will be fine also make sure you burn it as slow as you can
[09:33] <etsme> how much difference in speed shall i observe on aforementioned systems ?
[09:33] <joshdoe> ok will do
[09:34] <joshdoe> what about the raid drvers?
[09:34] <drape> roast: nothing in Xorg.log
[09:34] <paradizelost> joshdoe: raid drivers are normally autotmatic
[09:34] <gnomefreak> joshdoe: im nmot sure but i thought ubuntu had raid drivers in the repos
[09:34] <minimouse> paradizelost> not always
[09:34] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: i think you will be surprised
[09:34] <roast> drape: any mysterious logons?
[09:34] <paradizelost> minimouse: that's why i said normally:D
[09:34] <minimouse> :
[09:35] <minimouse> :D
[09:35] <aaron__> nevermind, thanks guys it works now.
[09:35] <mdweil> ubunto networking issue...help?

[09:36] <poi> anybody knows how can in change my plane in flightgear?
[09:36] <etsme> Hexidigital_, really. Well sorry for asking such stupid question, but i need some votes to choose. p3 1.0ghz is from Compaq and p3 1.13ghz is from Dell
[09:36] <roast> drape: okay :)
[09:36] <joshdoe> even for raid sata?
[09:36] <joshdoe> from intel
[09:36] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: in linux, memory management is better
[09:36] <fooker> Hey all. Trying to help someone install Ubuntu long-distance, and they are saying that ubuntu has no console installer? Is this true?
[09:36] <aLPHa_LeaK> fooker: it does. but not on the desktop cd
[09:37] <tmccrary> I'm having a problem with the latest version of Dapper. Hal doesn't seem to want to start, it just hangs here: Starting Hardware abstraction layer hald
[09:37] <h3sp4wn> fooker: netboot/mini.iso definately supports installation over a serial console
[09:37] <Deft> fooker: depends how you define console, there's no line mode installer...
[09:37] <Flannel> tmccrary: #ubuntu+1 for dapper
[09:37] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: my laptop is a 1.4ghz celeron with 512 ram, and it purrs like a kitten with ubuntu
[09:37] <h3sp4wn> fooker: If thats what you want
[09:37] <tmccrary> ok thanks
[09:37] <igorzolnikov> how i can install flash into firefox...? i have amd64... and ubuntu 5.10
[09:37] <apollo13> moin, i have got a little problem, ssh needs long to login (better: until to get to the password prompt), -v interrupts at debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received for about 30 sec, why? After login it is working fine. any ideas?
[09:37] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell igorzolnikov about flash
[09:37] <etsme> Hexidigital_, ok thanks.
[09:37] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: no problem
[09:37] <h3sp4wn> Deft: netboot/mini.iso line mode by default
[09:37] <fooker> Sorry, should have been clearer - command line based. Doesn't require X to be running
[09:38] <gnomefreak> fooker: the install cd has that
[09:38] <gnomefreak> fooker: what version of ubuntu first off?
[09:38] <Deft> apollo13: no, but please say if you find the answer! I'm thinking of filing a bug on it
[09:38] <mdweil> gnomefreak?  networking problem?  help?
[09:39] <gnomefreak> mdweil: nope mine works fine ;) sorry whats up?
[09:39] <h3sp4wn> apollo13: That is to be expected if there is no dns setup for the machine(s)
[09:39] <duneatreides> does any use LimeWire?
[09:39] <gnomefreak> !anyone
[09:39] <mdweil> can't get to inet through ubuntu...can through slax.  same machine
[09:39] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? </hint>
[09:39] <Hexidigital_> !frostwire
[09:39] <ubotu> frostwire is, like, a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
[09:39] <hastesaver> duneatreides, just ask :)
[09:39] <apollo13> h3sp4wn: arg, also in the local net?
[09:40] <etsme> Hexidigital_, oh yes one thing more, I use VNC client to connect to my ubuntu box, I have only one monitor. Once I changed my screen resolution to 640x480 through VNC. After that all other screen resolution modes are disabled. How to change it back to 800x600 ?
[09:40] <perceptualchaos> I don't understand what the variable is that the error message I flooded the room with by accident is
[09:40] <perceptualchaos> LD_LIBRARY_PATH
[09:40] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: do you know networking>?
[09:40] <perceptualchaos> where is this variable, and what does it do? how do I change it?
[09:40] <h3sp4wn> apollo13: Yep (or you try adding them to /etc/hosts on both machines)
[09:40] <Hexidigital_> gnomefreak:: what aspect?
[09:41] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: one second
[09:41] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: lookinng
[09:41] <gnomefreak> mdweil: cant connect to inet from ubuntu but can from slak on same pc
[09:41] <gnomefreak> Hexidigital_: ^^^
[09:41] <etsme> Hexidigital_, ok
[09:41] <apollo13> h3sp4wn: how, i tried it with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx computer newline xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx laptop
[09:41] <aaron__> anyone know a good program for copying dvd's?
[09:41] <apollo13> an its not working
[09:41] <Hexidigital_> gnomefreak:: i'll see what i can do... hardwired or wlan?
[09:42] <gnomefreak> mdweil: hardwaired or wireless?
[09:42] <mdweil> hard
[09:42] <Hexidigital_> sorry gnomefreak, meant to hit enter :-P
[09:42] <mdweil> to router/dsl
[09:42] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: can you ping your router?
[09:42] <gnomefreak> mdweil: did you go to system>admin>networking and see if its enabled?
[09:42] <mdweil> not from ubuntu, slax,yes.
[09:43] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: do a ifconfig, and pastebin the results
[09:43] <igorzolnikov> where is gplflash?
[09:43] <h3sp4wn> apollo13: thats the correct way
[09:43] <NickGarvey> !fonts
[09:43] <ubotu> well, fonts is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FontInstallHowto
[09:43] <Hexidigital_> ubotu:: tell mdweil about pastebin
[09:43] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: it tells you how to install it if you read it on the site i gave you
[09:44] <Deft> apollo13: I just the problem on mine was that /etc/resolv.conf was all invalid; emptying that and setting it to my local router (linksys) fixed it all
[09:44] <apollo13> h3sp4wn: thx, i looked through my /etc/hosts and found out, that i used the wrong hostname ^^
[09:44] <gnomefreak> igorzolnikov: but i do have to say i heard its not worth it that running flash in a 386 chroot was better (i dont touch the 64bit stuff)
[09:44] <apollo13> @deft, thx, but it is working by now
[09:44] <Hexidigital_> etsme:: all i found was this
[09:44] <Hexidigital_> !fixresolution

[09:51] <mdweil> Hexidigital:  connected now, can't activate.  will this stay sticky, tho?
[09:51] <Sid6000> yeah
[09:51] <Hexidigital_> Surfnkid:: mine is still buggy
[09:51] <Surfnkid> i have a problem playing mp3's now...  anyone can help?
[09:51] <Sid6000> ALSA, in certain cases, still won't play more than one sound.
[09:52] <Surfnkid> whats it doing
[09:52] <guerra> plz someone help me! i get this message: configure: error: Your libstdc++ doesn't have the sstream or strstream classes
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: should when you start up your system... should autoconnect
[09:52] <guerra> what should i do?
[09:52] <crimsun> Sid6000: that happens if you use an app that specifically requests the hw device (as in plughw:foo or any oss emulation)
[09:52] <guerra> i use gcc 4
[09:52] <Falluccer> I am having a network problem, when I try to access a windows computer, ubuntu asks me to first login to 192.168.0.1 which is the IP address of my ethernet card that is attached to my Xbox via a crossover cable. If I click cancel on that it comes up with another authentication window that asks me to sign into "ANTHONY" which is the Hostname and Domain name of my computer. The name of the computer that I am trying to connect
[09:52] <mdweil> Hexidigital: thanks.  will try again.
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> Surfnkid:: i have to disable wlan0 and re-enable wlan0 for it to connect to my a.p.. i found that bug by accident
[09:52] <Sid6000> Trying to play a metronome program (gtick) while also playing an MP3 will block it
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: you are connected now though?
[09:52] <Surfnkid> oh
[09:52] <crimsun> Sid6000: what are you using to play the mp3?
[09:52] <Hexidigital_> Surfnkid:: my ap uses WEP though
[09:52] <Surfnkid> wat ap wasa it
[09:53] <Surfnkid> ah
[09:53] <Sid6000> crimsum: Videolan, set to use ALSA
[09:53] <Surfnkid> yeah i did hear WEP was a bit of a problem
[09:53] <crimsun> Sid6000: and what is gtick configured to use?
[09:53] <mdweil> Hexidigital: yes...after I pressed Activate, but was not before.
[09:53] <Deft> Falluccer: how are you trying to access this windows box?
[09:53] <Sid6000> crimsum: /dev/dsp
[09:53] <Surfnkid> I just use MAC control to filter access thru my router so i dont have to use WEP.. to much WEEPing :P
[09:53] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: good.. you should be set from now on... if you want, restart to be sure
[09:54] <mdweil> Hexidigital:  thanks.
[09:54] <Hexidigital_> mdweil:: np
[09:54] <crimsun> Sid6000: that's precisely what I just described. When an app specifically requests the hw device (oss emulation case), then it blocks all other apps.
[09:54] <Falluccer> Deft, through network servers
[09:54] <Hexidigital_> Surfnkid:: i use both, WEP and MAC filtering
[09:54] <Sid6000> crimsum: will using ALSA for OSS emulation fix the problem?
[09:54] <crimsun> Sid6000: if gtick allows you to choose an audio backend, set it to use alsa instead of oss or esd.
[09:54] <Falluccer> deft, places->network servers
[09:54] <Sid6000> crimsum: do you know of an alternate device file I could use for gtick?
[09:55] <Deft> Falluccer: what it's probably trying to do is see which servers on the network you can access, so that it can display all your options
[09:55] <crimsun> Sid6000: don't think of files. Does it allow you to choose alsa/oss/esd?
[09:55] <Surfnkid> why is it everything linux based is so much metric and exact
[09:55] <Surfnkid> windows sure does make people feel dumb
[09:55] <Sid6000> crimsum: sadly, it only allows for choosing a device file
[09:55] <uscg_corey> anyone else have a download speed issue with the Bittorrent Client that comes with ubuntu?
[09:55] <Falluccer> Deft: I only have the window computer and my computer hooked up
[09:55] <Deft> Falluccer: what happens if you trying you directly access ANTHONY, by going to smb://ANTHONY ?
[09:55] <crimsun> Sid6000: then leave it and instead use ``aoss gtick''
[09:56] <crimsun> Sid6000: you'll need to install alsa-oss from universe.
[09:56] <jim> anyone can suggest a good virtual machine software in ubuntu?
[09:56] <Hexidigital_> jim:: vmware
[09:56] <Falluccer> deft, I'm trying to access family
[09:56] <Deft> Falluccer: oh, sorry, misread
=== jim is now known as sisaker
[09:56] <Sid6000> crimsum: THAT was it!!
[09:56] <joshdoe> I got ubuntu burnt and booting
[09:56] <Deft> Falluccer: replace with the name of the other computer
[09:56] <Falluccer> deft, how would I do that
[09:56] <Sid6000> crimsum: DUDE. THANK YOU.
[09:57] <joshdoe> Now I need to install but I need it to recognize my intel SATA raid
[09:57] <Falluccer> smb:\\family, but where would I type it
[09:57] <Sid6000> crimsum: I've been pulling my hair, wondering why ALSO OSS emulation didn't work
[09:57] <sisaker> hexidigital, is it vmware player?
[09:57] <joshdoe> Will it give me an option to format the raid?
[09:57] <Deft> Falluccer: use forward slashes, and type it in the F2 run box
[09:57] <crimsun> Sid6000: it works just fine.
[09:57] <Hexidigital_> sisaker:: i use vmware server
[09:57] <sisaker> hexidigital difference?
[09:57] <Deft> Falluccer: sorry, Alt+F2
[09:58] <Sid6000> crimsum: that it does. Thanks man.
[09:58] <igorzolnikov> i have swf-player... but how i can use it
[09:58] <Falluccer> deft, in the terminal?
[09:58] <Hexidigital_> sisaker:: uses resources more efficiently (i'm pretty sure in vmware player you cannot create virtual machines)
[09:58] <Deft> Falluccer: press Alt+F2, then type smb://nameofcomputer in the run box
[09:58] <P3L|C4N0> greetings
[09:58] <sisaker> you can create virtual machines in virtual machines?
[09:58] <Hexidigital_> sisaker:: i have vmware server running a win 2000 machine as a print server (lexmark x75 which is not linux supported)
[09:59] <h3sp4wn> sisaker: You can create virtual machines with qemu and then run them in vmwareplayer
[09:59] <sisaker> ah
[09:59] <lufis> Is it just me, or is Dapper a lot slower than previous releases?
[09:59] <joshdoe> Help
[09:59] <alexito-> how i install ubuntu en another hard drive without erasing the other hard drive that have windows
[09:59] <Hexidigital_> sisaker:: i meant, you have to use another tool to make the machine
[09:59] <joshdoe> I am at the format screen
[09:59] <joshdoe> and I want to span the riad array
[09:59] <Deft> lufis: I think most people find it faster
[09:59] <joshdoe> it only shows as 2 seperate disks
[09:59] <Hexidigital_> sisaker:: h3sp4wn is correct, but (in my experience) it is real slow
[10:00] <lufis> Deft: Hmm.. well, I don't know. Things seem slower to me
[10:00] <h3sp4wn> Hexidigital: qemu is slow but you can create a vmware virtual machine with it and use it in the player
[10:00] <speedsix> Hi does anyone know of a command that can give a particular window focus?
[10:01] <Hexidigital_> h3sp4wn:: true... never thought of that.... luckily i had paradizelost here to help me with my vmware-server install :)
[10:01] <AngryElf> what are the chances the spdif output (coaxial and optical) both work without any tweaking?
[10:01] <atom> Hi all. Got little problem with Dapper and Xorg. X -scanpci says one thing and lspci other.
[10:01] <sisaker> thats interesting
[10:01] <lufis> What is the most feature-rich torrent client for linux besides Azureus?
[10:01] <crimsun> AngryElf: one in two.
[10:02] <Falluccer> deft, what is the run box?
[10:02] <AngryElf> they're on my motherboard....the onboard sound seems to be working fine
[10:02] <Hexidigital_> h3sp4wn:: although, server supports usb devices on host
[10:02] <Sid6000> lufis: uTorrent? heh.
[10:02] <h3sp4wn> Hexidigital: So does player (will a little messing around in the config)
=== lars-ut is now known as lars-ut-away
=== sisaker is now known as issaker
[10:03] <h3sp4wn> Hexidigital: If you don't want it on permenantly then you are better off with player if you do I suppose server
[10:03] <lufis> Sid6000: I wish, windows only though
[10:03] <issaker> lol...
[10:03] <issaker> i just realized my nick is wrong
[10:03] <h3sp4wn> lufis: I use rtorrent
[10:03] <Hexidigital_> h3sp4wn:: :-P you can configure that with a little tweaking
[10:03] <Sid6000> lufis: You can actually run uTorrent in ubuntu using Cedega.
=== lol is now known as magical_trevsky
[10:03] <lufis> h3sp4wn: Really? Does it have ip filtering?
[10:04] <aLPHa_LeaK> use wine instead of cedega
[10:04] <Sid6000> h3sp4wn:Dude, tell me more of this rtorrent
[10:04] <lufis> Sid6000: Call me a prude, but I would rather have a native app
[10:04] <Sid6000> lufis: yeah...
[10:04] <aLPHa_LeaK> lufis: azureus? (i hate it. its bloated)
[10:05] <issaker> hexidigital, which version of vmware server should i download?
[10:05] <joshdoe> Anyone run nyth tv here?
[10:05] <lufis> aLPHa_LeaK: Me, too.
[10:05] <Hexidigital_> issaker:: lemme get you a link
[10:05] <issaker> yay
[10:05] <h3sp4wn> Rtorrent : Command line based very quick I dunno whether it has ip filtering

After that I tried a update from a fresh installed and updated badger (two times). It failed when updating the font-cache (near the end of the upgrade-process).

[10:18] <happycamper> hi
[10:19] <Madpilot> fearme, in the Printers dialogue box, go Printer->Add Printer and see if you can choose it manually
[10:19] <Flannel> joshdoe: apparently no one active in this channel knows how to help.  You might try poking around the forums, they seem to have a few relevant looking threads.
[10:19] <happycamper> do anybody know how i play *.wma files?
[10:20] <joshdoe> It is an embedded sata raid
[10:20] <joshdoe> DO i need the drivers first?

[10:22] <joshdoe> Um
[10:22] <joshdoe> I don't know

[10:22] <happycamper> ok thx
[10:22] <fearme> Madpilot,  i tried it asked for a password i put in mine and it said that i couldnt do it because i dont have access to sudo
[10:22] <joshdoe> asa ctive yes but I need to check the raid bios
[10:23] <joshdoe> one sec
[10:23] <maita> what is hoary
[10:23] <roast> maita: the name of an older version of ubuntu
[10:23] <Flannel> maita: Hoary is the previous version of ubuntu.  current is breezy.
[10:23] <maita> isn't there a way to put more resolution im sure 640 is not the most resolution the card can give
[10:23] <Flannel> maita: did you read that link ubotu gave you?
[10:23] <Madpilot> fearme, odd. I don't need my password at all for access to the Printers dialogue, and I've got a stock Ubuntu setup...
[10:23] <Madpilot> maita, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[10:24] <maita> yes
[10:24] <fearme> Madpilot, ya its kinda weird and its rly annoying not having access to sudo
[10:24] <mad_phoenix> howdy all.  im having trouble with a usb-keyboard for my laptop that just doesn't get recognized at all.  what is the proper way to add a keyboard to the system?  (i already tried dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver)
[10:24] <joshdoe> what a moron
[10:24] <maita> but is for users who had install a hoary
[10:24] <joshdoe> I forgot I exited without saving bios changes!
[10:24] <dereksivers> About to download 6.0.6 RC (http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/) - for AMD64.  But I don't understand one thing : Is "Desktop CD" the new name for what's known as "Live CD"?  So if I want to really install it I should choose "Server install CD"?
[10:24] <another_lemur> i hate it when I do that, joshdoe
[10:24] <Harold_P> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bill_gates-mugshot.jpg
[10:24] <McNutella> where are the logfiles kept for Koversation ?
[10:24] <jorgg> I have installed acroread and mozilla-acroread but pdf-files still wont show up in firefox any suggestions?
[10:25] <Flannel> joshdoe: heh, if the BIOS sees it as one HD, then yeah, you'll be fine, ubuntu will see it as one HD, and the firmware will take care of everything.
[10:25] <Madpilot> maita, ignore that - those instructions will work in later versions of Ubuntu
[10:25] <mad_phoenix> dereksivers: download the desktop, its what you want
[10:25] <another_lemur> dereksivers yes, the new install cd is a live cd
[10:25] <maita> ok thank you
[10:25] <Sid6000> jorgg: hold on. you have to run a console command, I think, which I'll look up
[10:25] <iron> okay, I have an interesting problem...
[10:25] <joshdoe> Its weird
[10:25] <joshdoe> the fastrack driver comes up and it says no drive found
[10:25] <chicken_Fire> Anybody here using eclipse-cdt for C programming?
[10:25] <McNutella> Iron, your thumb blew up ?
[10:25] <iron> I tried to install ubuntu on my friend's hard drive, and when it booted up, it was edubuntu, which I've never downloaded
[10:26] <dereksivers> mad_phoenix: I don't want a Live CD. I want to do a complete install.  So.. does that mean I want "Desktop CD" or "Server install CD"?
[10:26] <iron> it had some trouble installing the packages on bootup,though
[10:26] <joshdoe> comes up as third and fourth master
[10:26] <h3sp4wn> McNutella: ~.kde/share/apps/konversation/logs/ but you should probably ask kde questions in #kubuntu (usually get answered faster their also)
[10:26] <jorgg> Sid6000: okay
[10:26] <joshdoe> weird
[10:26] <iron> is it normal for a regular ubuntu installation CD to turn into edubuntu?
[10:26] <Sid6000> jorgg: You install acroread-plugins as well?
[10:26] <jorgg> Sid6000: yes
[10:27] <another_lemur> iron, that does not happen
[10:27] <iron> another_lemur:  yet that's exactly what has happened, I used the same installation CD as I used on my own ubuntu
[10:27] <another_lemur> you must have confused the images
[10:28] <jorgg> Sid6000; when i try to enter a pdf-file in firefox, I only get a download dialog box...
[10:28] <Sid6000> jorgg: hmm... restarted everything? firefox? gnome-panel?
[10:28] <iron> another_lemur:  I have no other images of ubuntu besides this one
[10:28] <jorgg> yes
[10:28] <another_lemur> then edubuntu already existed on the hdd
[10:28] <jorgg> Sid6000,  have rebooted the computer
[10:28] <iron> another_lemure:  it was even saying ubuntu when it first booted, but then turned into edubuntu
[10:28] <Sid6000> jorgg: My apologies - it seems my expertise ends here.
[10:28] <jorgg> Sid6000, thanks anyways! :)
[10:29] <McNutella> h3sp4wn: thank you
[10:29] <iron> another_lemur:  no, it used to be WinXP and the hdd got repartitioned
[10:29] <iron> holy crap, I'm defying all laws of the universe!
[10:30] <iron> I'm wondering if it somehow installed the wrong packages?
[10:30] <another_lemur> iron, i've installed many, many operating systems, but only 3 different ubuntu operations systems.  I've never gotten a different o/s tahn what I started with
[10:30] <joshdoe> reconfigured

[10:34] <ubotu> Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu
[10:34] <iron> another_lemur:  does that help at all?  I wonder if I should just retry installing it all over again.  it froze in the middle of installing the packages the first time.

[10:34] <Madpilot> ubuntu, ubotu is a bot, not a person

[10:34] <war92>  Anyone here use RAID5 using MDADM? So far I've been using it for testing purposes, I pulled the power off a drive to test it, works well.. anyone using it in production or just for a long time?  your comments on it?
[10:35] <dreamhack> another_lemur, no it's runing i don't undersante...
[10:35] <dabaR> iron: just install ubuntu-desktop. To change an ubuntu/edubuntu/kubuntu install to any of the other ones (and the other flavors) just install the corresponding -desktop package.
[10:35] <wizzlefish> how do you uninstall packages through the terminal?
[10:35] <Seveas> wizzlefish, apt-get remove
[10:35] <iron> debaR: but I think some packages didn't get installed properly anyway
[10:35] <another_lemur> wizzlefish: sudo apt-get remove pkg_name
[10:35] <dabaR> wizzlefish: aptitude works too, and better in some respects
[10:35] <joshdoe> I am using them for streaming video
[10:35] <BrianG> how do i prevent apps from starting up on start up?
[10:35] <joshdoe> Is a 128k block size ok
[10:35] <gumpish> Dur... so I'm in the middle of installing nmap using apt-get (on Breezy) and it's prompting me for the CD I installed from, which isn't handy. If I ctrl+C I won't bork anything will I?
[10:35] <BrianG> i cleared them out of the start up tab on sessions but they come back
[10:36] <Seveas> gumpish, ctrl+C is fine
[10:36] <dreamhack> rndc: connect failed: connection refused
[10:36] <dreamhack> ... i have try to give right at rndc.conf and rndc.key but i see again rndc: connect failed: connection refused
[10:36] <wizzlefish> dabaR: I'm just removing GNOME and KDE (and then reinstalling them) - should I use aptitude or apt-get?
[10:36] <dabaR> iron: just install that, and then run a "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade", it will catch any errors.
[10:36] <another_lemur> gumpish: you should be ok, just exit out and change /etc/apt/sources.list to not refer to cdrom
[10:36] <Madpilot> BrianG, when you shut down, make sure the 'Save Sessions' checkbox is NOT checked
[10:36] <iron> dabaR: thanks
[10:36] <Seveas> gumpish, and of you remove the cdrom line from /etc/apt/sources.list it won't ask again
[10:36] <dabaR> wizzlefish: aptitude is my answer most of the time, unless you really know what you are doing.
[10:36] <kermitX_> gumpish: dont forget to apt-get update after you do that.
[10:36] <BrianG> thanks i'll try that
[10:37] <alexito-> what better kde or gnome
[10:37] <kermitX_> xfce4 ;)
[10:37] <gumpish> right
[10:37] <gumpish> thanks all
[10:37] <Madpilot> alexito-, that's a matter of personal taste
[10:37] <another_lemur> dreamhack: when was the last time bind functioned as you expected?
[10:37] <wizzlefish> thanks guys
[10:37] <alexito-> xfce4 what that
[10:37] <dabaR> and requirements, do not forget the reqs
[10:38] <kermitX_> alexito: it's the gui in xubuntu
[10:38] <dabaR> ubotu: tell alexito- about xwinman
[10:38] <alexito-> i can install that on ubuntu?
[10:38] <kermitX_> install the xubuntu-desktop package.
[10:38] <dreamhack> another_lemur, Bind run but when i want reload i see that rndc: connect failed: connection refused
[10:38] <dreamhack>  but i run again
[10:39] <alexito-> ok and gdesklets  install the object dock? the menubar like mac osx?
[10:39] <dabaR> kinda sorta
[10:39] <another_lemur> dreamhack: you shouldn't have to dork with the key for rndc to work.  The package installs it for you.
[10:39] <mt3> Hi guys
[10:39] <mt3> Anyone here used Outport?
[10:40] <jefferson> _ip
[10:41] <disinterested_pe> im trying to install mplayer plug in 3.25.tar.gz ive got the files all in terminal does anyone know the next cmd?

[10:42] <disinterested_pe> ok i'll try it ty
[10:42] <dabaR> disinterested_pe: that will just unpack the zip
[10:42] <another_lemur> alexito-: have you tried searching for it with apt-cache search menubar?
[10:42] <Insup> kxdocker rather
[10:42] <Insup> kxdocker is it
[10:43] <Insup> alexito: http://www.xiaprojects.com/www/prodotti/kxdocker/main.php
[10:43] <chavo> alexito-, gdesklets comes with a dock like launcher
[10:43] <disinterested_pe> ive already done that i need the next cmd
[10:43] <dabaR> alexito-: google can answer that too
[10:43] <another_lemur> kxdocker requires kde, no?
[10:43] <alexito-> ok
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
[10:43] <another_lemur> dreamhack: ping
[10:44] <nordle> hello, is it simple to upgrade from dapper flight6 to rc?  Do I need to add the rc cd as a repo, or just rely on the already setup net connection?  or do I drop down to cli and dist-upgrade... or none of the above :) Thank you.
[10:44] <another_lemur> nordle: I upgraded from breezy to dapper rc quite easily
[10:45] <C22H28N2O> nordle: i's simply
[10:45] <C22H28N2O> *it's
[10:45] <alexito-> oh i need kde u say?
[10:45] <dabaR> disinterested_pe: go the to the dir that you created, and run make. If it errors, install build-essential
[10:45] <Madpilot> nordle, if you're already running flight6, you'll be updated to RC automatically w/ the usual update-manager
[10:45] <another_lemur> alexito- yes, kxdocker needs kde libraries
[10:45] <nordle> another_lemur: Thats what I was hoping! :)
[10:45] <alexito-> oh that bad and  gdesklets ?
[10:46] <disinterested_pe> ok
[10:46] <alexito-> i dont like kubuntu i cant configure ethernet and ubuntu does
[10:46] <Manika> which tool can I use for batch processing in images?
[10:46] <dabaR> disinterested_pe: sorry, ./configure first, before make
[10:46] <nordle> Madpilot: cool, thats great.  I asked because some other distros ie opensuse did NOT like being upgraded through the testing system, ie not happy going rc1 to rc3.  Thanks for the assurance.
[10:46] <dabaR> Manika: what batch processing do you have in mind?
[10:46] <another_lemur> nordle: you should be able to sudo apt-get update and then sudo dist-upgrade
[10:47] <iron> so how do I change the edubuntu-desktop to ubuntu-desktop?
[10:47] <Manika> dabaR: scaling at first
[10:47] <dabaR> Manika: you want to make thumbnails?
[10:47] <odat> anyone have a fresh dapper sources list  i need to replace mine with a good stable set
[10:48] <Manika> dabaR: no, just want to reduce sizes a little
[10:48] <jaroslav> Manika: use 'imagemagick'
[10:48] <nordle> another_lemur: ok, i'll try it thanks, its a P2-266 so might take a little time :)
[10:48] <another_lemur> the download is what takes a long time
[10:48] <jaroslav> Manika: it is a set of command line programs
[10:48] <Manika> jaroslav: thx, I'll check it ouy
[10:49] <dabaR> Manika: gthumb can do that too, and gimp, and others. imagemagick is a nice cli program
[10:49] <Manika> out*
[10:49] <odat> anyone have a fresh dapper sources list  i need to replace mine with a good stable set
[10:49] <jaroslav> Manika: You can use sth like: convert -resize 640x480 input.png > output.png

[10:49] <another_lemur> hrm
[10:50] <another_lemur> another_lemur, better?
[10:50] <Manika> jaroslav: what about an entire folder?
[10:50] <another_lemur> another_lemur, hey, tab works, too!
[10:50] <[NP] Tangent> any ideas why php won't work with mysql?
[10:50] <odat> thanx everyone
[10:50] <jaroslav> Manika: hmmm, let's say You want to alter images, not keeping original (larger ones)
[10:50] <Bung> should i use LVM ?
[10:50] <dabaR> Manika: Your shell will expand * to everything in the current directory
[10:51] <[NP] Tangent> Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect() in /home/jcox/Phox.php on line 32
[10:51] <another_lemur> [NP] Tangent, what does the error log say?
[10:51] <[NP] Tangent> error log where?
[10:51] <Manika> oooh I see!
[10:51] <jaroslav> Manika: mogrify -resize 640x480 *.JPG
[10:51] <dabaR> [NP] Tangent: you have phpX-mysql installed?
[10:51] <another_lemur> [NP] Tangent, ah, mysql client libraries are not installed?
[10:51] <[NP] Tangent> yeah
[10:51] <granden> Hi, I want to install linux-server as I understand it is used for Server system.
[10:52] <[NP] Tangent> php5-mysql is installed
[10:52] <dabaR> is this through apache?
[10:52] <granden> But the question is if I dont have SMP server will I loose performance if I use it?
[10:52] <HymnToLife> !lamp
[10:52] <ubotu> Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP, one of the standard internet server installations. Installing LAMP in Ubuntu is fairly straightforward. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
[10:52] <[NP] Tangent> no
[10:52] <[NP] Tangent> not through apache
[10:52] <Manika> jaroslav: just a final question.. there is no package for ubuntu on their website.. and I can't compile *ashamed*
[10:52] <granden> And  why is there no source package for it?
[10:52] <HymnToLife> granden> you can still install a SMP kernel on a server if you wish
[10:52] <dabaR> Manika: install everything through synaptic, or a cli client
[10:53] <granden> HymnToLife: But my cpu setup is not SMP
[10:53] <h3sp4wn> granden: It has a different scheduler by default (at least on dapper
[10:53] <issaker> can someone point me to a page that tells me how to install packages with tar.gz?
[10:53] <granden> I more want the server version for other options.
[10:53] <another_lemur> bung, do you have more than one drive in your system?  Will you be adding more drives?  if not, you don't need lvm
[10:53] <Manika> dabaR: yeah! nice to know synaptic has it, thank you very much!
[10:53] <granden> h3sp4wn: So It is prefered to choose that?
[10:53] <HymnToLife> granden> a server install is basially a normal install without a GUI
[10:54] <Madpilot> granden, the Ubuntu server install has access to the same repos, so you can get an SMP kernel after install
[10:54] <mathieu> Manika: you should _always_ first look at your package manager before you start looking for packages online
[10:54] <granden> This is after install
[10:54] <dabaR> ubotu: tell issaker about compiling
[10:54] <Manika> mathieu: yeah I've just learned that :)
[10:54] <pike__> issaker: it can vary. basically you unpack like tar xfvz packagename.tar.gz and then read the readme or install text file included
[10:54] <h3sp4wn> graden: There is a ubuntu-server.iso with most of the server packages already in it but that doesn't even have the smp kernel by default
[10:54] <granden> I am in the terminal now. But what i mean is. Do I loose performance if I use a SMP-kernel on a non-SMP-system?
[10:54] <Manika> !tell Manika about compiling
[10:54] <mathieu> Manika: it's a bad habit from windows
[10:54] <Bung> another_lemur: i only have a big external drive
[10:55] <Manika> mathieu: yes, I know.. but I'm happier in linux!
[10:55] <odat> are the repos's down?
[10:55] <daxxar> Heh. Fascinating. Creating a dir on a SMB-share from my Windows XP workstation on my Dapper RC (Ubuntu Server) spontaneously reboots the server. Deleting a directory goes fine. o.0
[10:55] <h3sp4wn> granden: Its tuned differently the server kernel you probably wouldn't notice much difference unless under very high load
[10:55] <daxxar> Creating a directory under the same local dir that the SMB-share is mapped to from shell works fine, creating a file works fine. It has happened three out of three times in a row when I've tested.
[10:55] <alexito-> lol there any dj mixing program for linux
[10:55] <dabaR> ping
[10:55] <another_lemur> bung, lvm may not be needed for your situation
[10:55] <daxxar> (and the directory isn't created at all)
[10:55] <Bung> another_lemur: ok thanks
[10:56] <daxxar> Anyone have any suggestions as to what could cause that behaviour=
[10:56] <daxxar> ?
[10:57] <billups> i just installed kubuntu but i cant play mp3 files. How can i play it?
[10:57] <another_lemur> billups, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[10:57] <abbot45> I've done everything in the RestrictedFormats wiki, but I still can't play any quicktime video at all.  Is that stuff just not supported?
[10:57] <dabaR> alexito-: I use mixxx, dunno if you wanna call it that. I told you to use google for such qs.
[10:57] <biovore> abbot45: amd64 machine?
[10:58] <abbot45> no
[10:58] <issaker> wait, so for a linux distro of a certain software, i actually get source codes?
[10:58] <skybox> hey guys! i've just dwl a flash app called "necflash" an executable, made it chmod a+x, but how do I launch/ use the executable?
[10:58] <dabaR> abbot45: some isnt, but I can play .mov files, older ones.
[10:58] <biovore> issaker: see the software packeges home page
[10:58] <HymnToLife> issaker> not unless you download it
[10:58] <abbot45> dabaR, i haven't had luck with any .mov file I've tried.
[10:58] <mathieu> skybox: have you tried running it in your browser?
[10:58] <another_lemur> alexito-,  apt-cache show audacity, perhaps you want that software?
[10:58] <dabaR> skybox: ./necflash in its dir
[10:58] <HymnToLife> most apps come without the source code to reduce filesizes
[10:58] <dabaR> abbot45: what are you playing them in?
[10:58] <HymnToLife> you can get the source in a separate package if you wish
[10:58] <biovore> there is also a apt-get source I think as well will grab the source for the package
[10:58] <issaker> yah i downloaded vmware
[10:59] <skybox> argh of course, thanks dabaR
[10:59] <abbot45> dabaR, totem-xine
[10:59] <issaker> and it ends in tar,gz
[10:59] <another_lemur> issaker, i just install vmware server on a dapper box, yesterday
[10:59] <issaker> and im just confused on how to install it
[10:59] <HymnToLife> !vmware
[10:59] <ubotu> Please check this out, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingVMWare adjusting kernel versions to your own, to get the number replace the numbers with " `uname -r" The ` is a Backtic
[10:59] <another_lemur> issaker, sudo /path/to/vmware-install.pl
[10:59] <dabaR> it needs at least two backticks
[11:00] <issaker> oh
[11:00] <abbot45> When is the final version of Dapper going to be released?  I heard sometime next week.
[11:00] <another_lemur> issaker, I used the tar.gz so first you must tar xzf VMware-server....
[11:00] <wubrgamer> hey guys minor almost emergency
[11:00] <dabaR> !dapper
[11:00] <ubotu> **** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until then
[11:00] <wubrgamer> seriously
[11:00] <another_lemur> issaker, then cd into folder it creates and run the command I said earlier
[11:00] <wubrgamer> i just installed ubuntu dapper server (this is just an ubuntu issue, not dapper specific)
[11:00] <dabaR> wubrgamer: not by the sound of your nick it isnt
[11:00] <issaker> \ah
[11:00] <wubrgamer> what/
[11:00] <wubrgamer> ?
[11:01] <dabaR> ask
[11:01] <wubrgamer> anyway, i installed the server, worked
[11:01] <wubrgamer> THEN
[11:01] <wubrgamer> apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[11:01] <dabaR> !enter
[11:01] <ubotu> Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
[11:02] <phrowzen> hey
[11:02] <phrowzen> anyone familiar with lvm?
[11:02] <wubrgamer> sorry, didn't mean to, anyway, in the middle of all of this, my cat turned off my pc........
[11:02] <abbot45> One more question.  I've got a 2nd hard drive mounted on my system, but I don't want the icon for it to appear on my desktop.  Just in my "Places" drop down menu.  Is there a way to get rid of that?
[11:02] <Manika> dabaR and jaroslav: thank you very much! just used the program and it's excellent!
[11:02] <jhenn> what is in the "restricted copyrights" section of ubuntu?
[11:02] <dabaR> Manika: glad to hear that
[11:02] <another_lemur> issaker, I will install vmware right now on this box.  If you need further help, please let me know
[11:02] <Tidus> !tell jhenn about restricted
[11:02] <axisme> hi, is there a way to mount a .bin? i want to view its contents but dont want to burn it to disk
[11:02] <issaker> dabar, i got it to work, should i install it in /usr/bin?
[11:02] <wubrgamer> so umm, what should i do to continue the ubuntu-desktop install ?
[11:02] <dabaR> abbot45: yes. It is in the configuration editor in the applications menu>system something
[11:03] <another_lemur> axisme, is your .bin a floppy?
[11:03] <jhenn> Tidus: can i msg u?
[11:03] <alexito-> the ubuntu have html program like frontpage?
[11:03] <pike__> axisme: download cdemu to mount bin cue files
[11:03] <dabaR> wubrgamer: do you get an error?
[11:03] <another_lemur> erUSUL, floppy image?
[11:03] <Tidus> jhenn, yes
[11:03] <jcapote> im running 6.06 LTS and i was wondering why gedit cant save remote files, while i was able to do this in the last flights
[11:03] <wubrgamer> i rebooted in the middle of the install of ubuntu-desktop......
[11:03] <axisme> video file
[11:03] <abbot45> dabaR, ok.  i'll look around in there.
[11:03] <dabaR> !nvu
[11:03] <ubotu> I heard nvu is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingNvu http://www.nvu.com/ Linux/Mac/Windows Web authoring.
[11:03] <wubrgamer> nvu is amazing.....
[11:03] <wubrgamer> !gnome
[11:04] <pike__> axisme: alternatively mplayer can play images like mplayer cue://filename.cue:2
[11:04] <dabaR> axisme: it is in the apps>desktop>nautilus, something like that. it is a checkbox for show drives, something along those lines
[11:04] <dabaR> alexito-: nvu is for you
[11:04] <dabaR> wubrgamer: did you try just running the same command you used before hte cat incident?
[11:05] <alexito-> nice dabar
[11:05] <issaker> whats the build-essential command?
[11:05] <issaker> sudo apt-get install build-essential
[11:05] <dabaR> it is a program, that can be installed
[11:05] <dabaR> or a packagem rather
[11:05] <issaker> thats kinda like gdebi?
[11:06] <dabaR> no, it is a package that installs programs and libs necessary for basic compilations on your ubuntu system
[11:06] <dabaR> issaker: gdebi installs .deb files
[11:06] <issaker> what does the "build-essential" install?
[11:06] <another_lemur> issaker, user apt-cache show build-essential to see that
[11:07] <another_lemur> erUSUL, use
[11:07] <abbot45> oh yeah.  one more question.  on a previous install of ubuntu i had it would give me sound previews when i hover over sound files.  how do i get that working again?
[11:07] <dabaR> issaker: run that above command and apt will show you what it wants to install, and let you choose whether to go ahead
[11:07] <another_lemur> erUSUL, use, i mean
[11:07] <another_lemur> ok, autocomplete is bad
[11:07] <dabaR> abbot45: ya, that is sweet!
[11:07] <issaker> dabar, what that command does is that it install the essential files to do something?
[11:07] <dabaR> abbot45: perhaps an option in your nautilus prefs
[11:07] <another_lemur> abbot45:  see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[11:08] <dabaR> to build binary files from source code.
[11:08] <issaker> oic
[11:08] <abbot45> another_lemur, i've done all that.  it doesn't say anything about sound previews in nautilus.
[11:08] <axisme> dabaR, what do i do in nautilus
[11:08] <another_lemur> abbot45, it does when I read it
[11:08] <dabaR> it is the essential package for building binary files from source code on ubuntu
[11:08] <dabaR> just a package that nicely bundles what is required
[11:09] <issaker> okiez
[11:09] <issaker> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[11:09] <issaker> and this does..?
[11:09] <issaker> it installs a linux header..?
[11:09] <linuxgeekery> installs the linux headers for your kernel version

[11:09] <Avantopia> Anyone here installed Dapper RC1 with LVM2 and EVMS?

[11:22] <Blissex> joshdoe: no, nobody can do that.
[11:22] <roast> ShadowNova: oh. to /update/
[11:22] <roast> ShadowNova: oop, never mind.
[11:22] <joshdoe> so much for the help forum
[11:22] <daxxar> Madpilot, didn't seem to have it. :)
[11:22] <lakez> any of you guys know how to recursively compare 2 directories ?   I backed up to 2 different places and i wanna make sure the files are identical on each
[11:22] <joshdoe> back to xp :-(
[11:23] <another_lemur> joshdoe, maybe
[11:23] <Madpilot> Blissex, not funny.
[11:23] <ShadowNova> Yeah, I have 1.4.2, but I want to update to the 1.5 I installed
[11:23] <Blissex> joshdoe: however you can look for the Linux RAID HOWTO.
[11:23] <roast> ShadowNova: that you installed?
[11:23] <Surfnkid> hey madpilot
[11:23] <hav0k> does anyone know how to set my screen resolution back to 1280x800 when its not on the list?
[11:23] <ShadowNova> yeah
[11:23] <another_lemur> joshdoe, don't hurt yourself by reading that :)
[11:23] <roast> ShadowNova: did you use make-jpkg and all?
[11:23] <Blissex> Madpilot: it is not funny, but it is accurate.
[11:23] <Chicken__Fire> ShadowNova, so you have java-sun already? Otherwise, you have to enable the multiverse in your apt configs.
[11:23] <ShadowNova> no
[11:23] <Surfnkid> thanks for the help you gave about the wlan0
[11:23] <Surfnkid> i got it going
[11:23] <another_lemur> joshdoe, I can help you
[11:23] <ShadowNova> I updated with automatix
[11:23] <joshdoe> I set up the raid in the bios and am trying to format and partition under ubuntu
[11:23] <Madpilot> Blissex, if you're not going to actually be helpful, just ignore the newbie questions, OK?
[11:24] <dabaR> minubotell hav0k about fixres
[11:24] <pike__> lakez: you mean like diff -r ?
[11:24] <joshdoe> am I supposed to see it as one drive becasue I see 2
[11:24] <Madpilot> Surfnkid, good!
[11:24] <another_lemur> joshdoe, how does the raid appear to your ubuntu?
[11:24] <dabaR> ubotu: tell hav0k about fixres
[11:24] <roast> joshdoe: under ubuntu or the ubuntu _installer_?
[11:24] <Surfnkid> yes sir, wasnt so bad after a few head butts with commands :P
[11:24] <joshdoe> When I go to the partion disk menu I see 2 drives
[11:24] <Blissex> Madpilot: but it is very dangerous to delude people that everything is easy and they can just barge ahead. A cautionary warning is very helpful thing.
[11:24] <joshdoe> Is this correct?
[11:25] <roast> joshdoe: a /dev/sda and a /dev/sdb?
[11:25] <joshdoe> yes
[11:25] <Bung> ok so i had to install a server install so my comp didnt over heat .. i was told this is ok, i just need to install base-xorg-something-something and xfce4
[11:25] <Bung> whats the xorg base i need
[11:25] <roast> joshdoe: and it appears as one on windows?
[11:25] <Madpilot> Blissex, "no, nobody can help you" is hardly a 'cautionary warning' - it's just rude & unhelpful.
[11:25] <lakez> pike__, hrmm i wonder if that works
[11:25] <Surfnkid> ok, in a brief somoene just tell me what the diff between GNOME and KDE is
[11:25] <joshdoe> it shows scsi1 (0,0,0) (SDA) - 120GB ATA .....

[11:26] <roast> joshdoe: if set up to what you're thinking, yes.

[11:26] <DeamoN> algum BR
[11:27] <ShadowNova> does anyone know the command to update the java version?
[11:27] <joshdoe> I thought th eraid manager was supposed to stripe the drive in the bios mode
[11:27] <Blissex> Madpilot: I know it will come as a shock to you, but there are universities that spend six month courses teaching about RAID...
[11:27] <joshdoe> ok brb
[11:27] <Madpilot> Blissex, 'RAID is difficult, have you used it before in Linux?' might be even better...
[11:27] <another_lemur> +1 madpilot, again :)
[11:28] <another_lemur> I mean, I agree with him again
[11:28] <Madpilot> Blissex, I know just enough about RAID to know that it's complex; I don't use it myself. I was taking issue with your tone, not the specific topic
[11:29] <Chicken__Fire> ShadowNova, try "sudo update-alternatives --config java"

I installed the nvidia-glx drivers and now when I boot the login screen is just blank.  If I ctrl alt backspace the nvidia logo pops up, everything comes back and I'm fine from there but the blank screen is annoying.

[11:34] <nordle> mmm, ok guys, can someone tell me where the password file is stored in ubuntu, I thought it was /etc/passwd but theres no funny symbols.  The reason I ask is because I setup a naff old laptop for my brother, who has forgotten his password and I stupidly did not add myself to the system as a backup/safegurd.  Last chance is to try john the ripper, but there are no hashes in /etc/passwd.
[11:34] <another_lemur> lappy, load the kernel nvidia driver on startup by putting nvidia in /etc/modules
[11:35] <Jowi> kevor: it does :)
[11:35] <issaker> another_lemur now it asks for directory to install, just press enters?

[11:40] <issaker> another_lemur nwo that i have installed vmware, how do i run it?
[11:40] <another_lemur> nordle, reboot the box, hit escape to get into the grub menu, edit the boot part, ont he line that says kernel, remove everything after the root=/dev/something and change ro splache quiet with the word single
[11:41] <gholias> I need that everytime the ubuntu reboot it runs this command iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
[11:41] <gholias> how can i do this?
[11:41] <piotrek> chavo, i've install build_essential already :(
[11:41] <BlueEagle> nafai_: don't start gdm to prevent graphical login. Set up a framebuffer on the console to give a higher resolution or use a smaller font. (fb is concidered very slooow by many)
[11:41] <another_lemur> issaker, oh, you need to have inetd or xinetd run it, then you access it with the vmware console application
[11:41] <h3sp4wn> gholias: What have you done ?
[11:42] <gholias> h3sp4wn, nothing, just everytime i reboot, i need do this command
[11:42] <Mortal`> How do I reinstall Apache? I've tried removing all config-files, "Remove all" in Synaptic and clearing the cache, but the config-files won't recreate themselves. I've tried recreating them, but I can't get them right.
[11:42] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
[11:42] <nafai_> BlueEagle: Could you point me to what controls the loading process?
[11:42] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  to start to share the conection
[11:42] <h3sp4wn> gholias: pastebin /etc/network/interfaces
[11:43] <Jowi> nafai_: you can set the default runlevel in /etc/inittab
[11:43] <gholias> h3sp4wn, its working fine, this comando just allow share the conection
[11:43] <gholias> h3sp4wn,  here can i put it to start when reboot?
[11:44] <cocox> wich personal firewall would you recommend for use with ubuntu ??????????????
[11:44] <h3sp4wn> gholias: It should be in the eth2 section of that file (as I told you to put it earlier I believe it was me who told you the command in the first place)
[11:44] <biovore> cocox: theres only one iptables
[11:44] <Jowi> cocox: firestarter (frontend for iptables)
[11:44] <gholias> h3sp4wn, hold on
[11:45] <Mortal`> How do I get the original Apache configuration files back?
[11:45] <zcat[1] > is there any really easy tool for setting up NAT?
[11:45] <Hexidigital_> can someone help me with writing a script to automate disabling then re-enabling my wlan0 card?
[11:45] <gumpish> Is it normal for "Regenerating fonts cache..." to take a long time during a dist-upgrade?
[11:45] <HymnToLife> zcat[1] > you might try Firestarter
[11:45] <Hexidigital_> i know how to do it, but i dont know how to do it when a sudo password is needed
[11:46] <h3sp4wn> zcat: iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE is the magic command
[11:46] <Bung> if i dont have xorg installed, and i apt-get install xfce4, will it install all the deps?
[11:46] <gholias> h3sp4wn, found it, let me try, as you said me before
[11:46] <another_lemur> bung, i would expect so
[11:46] <biovore> and echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[11:46] <rem> where do you define the default video application in Ubuntu ?
[11:46] <zcat[1] > What I'd really like to see (perhaps in eft?) is a 'share this connection' checkbox that turns on NAT _and_ sets up DHCP on all the other connections, the way Windows does..
[11:46] <gholias> rebooting
[11:47] <Bung> ok i installed xserver-xorg, but startx doesnt work... i cant find any info on this =S
[11:47] <h3sp4wn> Why do people insist on rebooting all the time ?
[11:47] <zcat[1] > rebooting is fun..
[11:47] <biovore> h3sp4wn: there brained washed by MS
[11:47] <zcat[1] >  09:44:04 up 25 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.04, 0.23, 0.31
[11:48] <biovore> I havn't rebooted this box in over 150 days
[11:48] <Eleaf> What would be the easiest way to create a 'connection tracker'  i.e. to see how many are connected to my ftp server at a time.. =)
[11:48] <Hexidigital_> biovore:: nice :)
[11:48] <Mortal`> How do I get the original Apache configuration files back?
[11:48] <Eleaf> don don don
[11:48] <another_lemur> i can't stand reboot :)
[11:48] <zcat[1] > I'm running dapper; I reboot every time I get a new kernel just in case it's broken.
[11:48] <h3sp4wn> after 3 years of 24/7 operation / uptime seagate cheetahs usually don't come back maybe one in 20 times
[11:48] <HymnToLife> Eleaf> that's what logfiles are for
[11:48] <another_lemur> biovore, then you kernel is ancient
[11:49] <biovore> Mortal`: you can try a dpkg-reconfigure apache
[11:49] <zcat[1] > .. already had one that killed irda on my laptop, totally made the thing unbootable.
[11:49] <biovore> another_lemur: custom kernel.. I have a custom stat raid card I had to manual write my own kernel driver for
[11:49] <Eleaf> HymnToLife, really?  Hmm, I'm using proftp.
[11:49] <zcat[1] > (it still is!)
[11:49] <another_lemur> biovore, interesting.  what device do you use for raid?
[11:49] <Mortal`> biovore, nope, that doesn't change the .conf's
[11:50] <biovore> a pci-e x8 sata raid card
[11:50] <lonegranger> when is dapper officially released@
[11:50] <biovore> uses a intel IO processor with 128MB or am on board the raid card
[11:50] <zcat[1] > h3sp4wn: you do a cold reboot with about a half-hour downtime? A simple reboot isn't going to show up stiction problems :)
[11:50] <McNutella> Id like to stop the window minimise animation please, how would this be done ?
[11:50] <gnomefreak> lonegranger: june 1st
[11:50] <another_lemur> biovore, have you heard of coraid?
[11:50] <biovore> coraid?
[11:50] <Mortal`> How do I get the original Apache configuration files back?
[11:51] <another_lemur> www.coraid.com
[11:51] <lonegranger> hope it fixes some of my problems
[11:51] <biovore> thats network storage
[11:51] <gumpish> Is it normal for "Regenerating fonts cache..." to take a long time during a dist-upgrade? Cuz I've been staring at it for like 15 minutes now...
[11:52] <another_lemur> gumpish, hehe, I hate the wait, too
[11:52] <h3sp4wn> zcat: Managers don't like downtime (even if they will get more if it isn't sorted out)
[11:52] <biovore> I am ussing a acera sata raid card taking up 1 sli slot
[11:52] <nordle> another_lemur:  wow, root :)  Your a star!  Many thanks.  Just hope my main machine is up to the job, don't want grow old watching john the ripper use 99% of my cpu :)
[11:52] <zcat[1] > McNutella: somewhere deep in gconf-editor there might be an option for it :)
[11:52] <another_lemur> nordle, anytime :)
[11:52] <zcat[1] > h3sp4wn: you don't have dual redundant servers?!!
[11:53] <another_lemur> nordle, why are you using john?  you can just change the passwd
[11:53] <Mortal`> How do I get the original Apache configuration files back?
[11:53] <h3sp4wn> zcat: Of course but they still don't like downtime it show up on their silly graphs
[11:53] <zcat[1] > h3sp4wn: that's easy. Fudge the graphs..
[11:54] <another_lemur> zcat[1] , lol
[11:54] <nafai_> Can someone point me to a webpage or tutorial on setting a framebuffer (for a boot straight to a terminal)?
[11:54] <biovore> Mortal`: I think you just screwed.. This is why you always make backups of your configuration files ;-P  (lesson learn the hardway I guess)
[11:54] <Billionaire> Hi
[11:54] <] GoldenDragon> hmm, can someone help me update firefox?
[11:55] <zcat[1] > !ff1.5
[11:55] <ubotu> You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
[11:55] <another_lemur> !ff1.5
[11:55] <DBO> !ff1.5
[11:55] <] GoldenDragon> i've been at that page.. but I'm unable to extract the tar to /opt
[11:55] <nordle> another_lemur: Now you understand how I created a system for a non-techy person and did not add a failsafe into it (ie me).....because Im thick! :)  Of course, man my brain is tyred!  I'm going to still leave it running because he sais that I gave him the password, but Im sure(ish) that I looked away and asked him to put one in.... just a bit of pathetic brotherly competition I guess :)
[11:55] <zcat[1] > I was first!
[11:55] <h3sp4wn> Mortal`: sudo aptitude purge apache && sudo aptitude install apache (or some such command)
[11:55] <Billionaire> I've a pcmcia cardbus with chip acx111, but when I insert it, from dmesg I don't see any message
[11:55] <DBO> zcat[1] , not on my screen!  though I think I still had some login lag...
[11:56] <Billionaire> anyone can suggest me why?
[11:56] <Mortal`> h3sp4wn, I'll try that out
[11:56] <cocox> biovore, Jowi sorry for make u wait.... i must install first iptables to use firestarter ???? firestarter its my best option ???
[11:56] <Billionaire> on debian it work
=== Eroick_ is now known as Eroick
[11:56] <temery> salut
[11:56] <temery> on se souvient de moi ?
[11:56] <biovore> cocox: I don't use firestarter here..
[11:56] <temery> je voulait installer amsn
[11:57] <hollerith> billionaire:yuo haven't got pcmcia loaded
[11:57] <zcat[1] > iptables is built into the kernel already.. firestarter just turns it on..
[11:57] <cocox> biovore, what do u use ?
[11:57] <Jowi> cocox: I wasn't waiting:) iptables is already installed for you. firestarter is a frontend for that (a nice graphical/clickable way to configure it)
[11:57] <biovore> cocox: cli and iptables
[11:57] <Billionaire> hollerith, yes I've got
[11:57] <biovore> cocox: see netfilter.org
[11:57] <] GoldenDragon> O_o
[11:57] <nafai_> Can someone point me to a webpage or tutorial on setting a framebuffer (for a boot straight to a terminal)?
[11:57] <hollerith> what's in tail /var/log/messages
[11:57] <messju> hi, how can I determine the subpixel ordering of my lcd?
[11:58] <Billionaire> hollerith, lsmod | grep yenta
[11:58] <Billionaire> yenta_socket           25292  2
[11:58] <Billionaire> rsrc_nonstatic         13376  1 yenta_socket
[11:58] <Billionaire> pcmcia_core            49348  3 pcmcia,yenta_socket,rsrc_nonstatic
[11:58] <cocox> biovore, Jowi and ubuntu doesnt come with a personal firewall installed or for install ???
[11:58] <zcat[1] > messju: get a magnifying glass and take a close look.. that's what I did :)
[11:58] <biovore> cocox: there is one built into the kernel on very linux out there
[11:58] <another_lemur> nordle, well, good luck, if your john dictionary has his password,t hen you will get it, otherwise it will be some time before it finds it.  On the order of weeks or months.
[11:58] <biovore> cocox: open a console and type sudo iptables --list
[11:58] <gnomefreak> ubotu tell Billionaire -about pastebin
[11:58] <messju> zcat[1] : hehe, I think my son has got one :)
[11:59] <Eleaf> HymnToLife, what do you think?
[11:59] <zcat[1] > has to be a good one, those pixels are small!
[11:59] <Jowi> ubotu, tell cocox about firestarter
[11:59] <HymnToLife> Eleaf> about what ?
[11:59] <Jowi> !info firestarter
[11:59] <ubotu> firestarter: (gtk program for managing and observing your firewall), section universe/admin, is optional. Version: 1.0.3-1.1ubuntu1 (breezy), Packaged size: 384 kB, Installed size: 1904 kB
[12:00] <h3sp4wn> I don't think people should use firestarter unless they understand the rules it generates
[12:00] <messju> this is a thinkpad a30 (1600x1200 @ 15"), pixels should be really small :(
[12:00] <hollerith> billionaire:look up pastebin on the web - is like a site to store reams of clipboard

[negative] [00:06] <aleka> Ashfire: I was actually locked into the virtual machine and couldn't figure out what the escape key was :(
[positive] [00:12] <djlenoir> <-- is looking for someone to help with a bluetooth issue. Problem = not working :)
[positive] [00:12] <Boumboum5> sylpou: go ahead. No need to ask if you can ask. :)
[positive] [00:12] <ubotu> sylpou_: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [00:14] <usser> verve: dont remove them :)
[negative] [00:16] <Colro> Ashfire908: there isn't one :(
[positive] [00:17] <Boumboum5> ubotu is a bot. :)
[positive] [00:17] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about is a bot. :) - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[negative] [00:18] <Keule|on> :(
[negative] [00:20] <Boumboum5> Keule|on: I want to help you but I don't know the answer. :(
[positive] [00:20] <Lifeisfunny> thanks Jordan_U  :)
[positive] [00:21] <Jordan_U> Lifeisfunny, np :)
[positive] [00:23] <gavintlgold> well i'm going to see how it goes :) hope I get good x back
[positive] [00:25] <Rolenun> is the Intel x86 usable with Intel 64-bit, or am I supposed to use AMD64 instead? :)
[positive] [00:27] <Boumboum5> speaker: less of a load on them now that upgrade day is over :)
[positive] [00:34] <speaker219> your welcome :)
[positive] [00:35] <Boumboum5> akiratheoni: Hope that helps :)
[positive] [00:35] <Keule|on> what? :)
[negative] [00:36] <Boumboum5> agwells: Your problem is beyond my beginner's competence... I don't know how to tweak your system to get your USB devices to work properly. Hopefully someone else will know.  I need to go now.. :(
[positive] [00:39] <jnc> we'll see, ZionPsyfer has generously offered to dig up a list of some sort... maybe it will help me along in my quest :)
[positive] [00:41] <Boumboum5> Intelligitimate: Yes. ogg vorbis   uses the .ogg extension. Lots of info  on it in wikipedia :)
[negative] [00:42] <Boumboum5> gavintlgold: that's a bit beyond my competence. :(  I'm still rather newbie-ish myself. At worst case, reinstall ubuntu.
[negative] [00:44] <Kodemage> tag: you're telling me :(
[positive] [01:01] <`eric-> cdm10, but it works? :)
[positive] [01:05] <Cryoniq> saloxin: thanks :)
[positive] [01:06] <Rolenun> is the Intel x86 build usable with Intel 64-bit, or should I use AMD64? :)
[positive] [01:08] <jnc> earlmred: no idea.  I'll bet they'd answer your inquiry though, especially if you fork over some money to them when it works :)
[positive] [01:11] <Cryoniq> saloxin: ah.. maybe I should switch my other box GF6200 TurboForce edition then to this box instead meanwhile for some compiz love untill then :)
[positive] [01:14] <Colro> ZionPsyfer: I'm not worried about WHY it locked up -- I caused that by applying a new GTK theme while it had 20+ tabs open :)
[positive] [01:20] <Rolenun> is the Intel x86 build usable with Intel 64-bit, or should I use AMD64? :)
[positive] [01:21] <Neatchee> Ahorner:  Well, let it run.  See how it goes :)
[positive] [01:22] <Neatchee> Ahorner:  You can always run "gksu -c aptitude dist-upgrade" later.  It won't hurt anything if you're fully upgraded :)
[negative] [01:24] <aoupi> hmm, can't find any wireless PCI cards that work out of the box to buy in sweden :(
[positive] [01:24] <Neatchee> Ahorner: My pleasure :)
[positive] [01:30] <Juice^> Sergo: are you really bored? :)
[negative] [01:38] <LinuxJuggalo> it looks so far away :(
[positive] [01:38] <katharos> wirechief: oh ok. dont mind me :)
[negative] [01:40] <Rich4> :(
[positive] [01:46] <Sergo> ZionPsyfer: for example, if there is a small scrath on Cd, the installation can fail with red screen:) .. with windows xp, there can be a 1000 of scratch, but no problem with installing
[positive] [01:46] <usser> through a hole in the pocket :)

[positive] [02:09] <Arafangion> joanki: You can also write to /tmp, but that is by definition TeMPorary data. :)
[positive] [02:10] <Neatchee> h1st0: No, i have plenty of leases available :)
[positive] [02:11] <Arafangion> joanki: That's it. :)
[positive] [02:11] <Arafangion> joanki: Yellow, actually. :)
[positive] [02:12] <Arafangion> joanki: Yup. :) It highlights if the name exists anywhere in the line.
[positive] [02:12] <Neatchee> stemount: are you a registered user on FreeNode? If so, PMs :)
[positive] [02:12] <Arafangion> joanki: I'm an irssi guy, it's great in conjunction with screen. :)
[positive] [02:13] <Arafangion> joanki: I run it on the server, and I just detach when I logout, and re-attach (ie, screen -rd) when I login. :) Yeah, in terminal.
[positive] [02:16] <katharos> mlalkaka: that's right, which is why i've been working so long on getting the nvidia drivers working :)
[negative] [02:16] <stemount> i feel great :(
[positive] [02:20] <stemount> :)
[positive] [02:23] <Vlet> bqmassey: Deluge :)
[positive] [02:24] <Arafangion> Ahorner: And that, my friend, is the difference between a software engineer, and a mere "programmer". :)
[positive] [02:25] <Vlet> bqmassey: uhh, I dunoh - I just use it and it works well :)
[positive] [02:26] <stemount> OpenDNS is great. :)
[positive] [02:27] <katharos> mlalkaka: awesome, thanx, i'll try that now, i'll be back to let you know how it goes :)
[negative] [02:27] <stemount> MySpace is poor :(
[positive] [02:27] <Vlet> joanki: it sounds like you're picking things up pretty well - once you get over the hump, you'll be all about *nix :)
[negative] [02:31] <stemount> oh :(
[positive] [02:32] <Arafangion> kevinO: Heh, indeed. ;)  Now carry on. :)

[positive] [03:07] <asbani> yep :)
[positive] [03:07] <Vlet> asbani: good :)
[negative] [03:08] <mrg> rb2: i've used kubuntu for years.. i even switched to ubuntu for the (supposedly) automatic desktop effects and all i got was the shaft (again) :(
[positive] [03:19] <matthew1429> heheh that's a noob question if i ever asked one :)
[positive] [03:20] <fatcatmatt> jimd1: i prefer gparted :)
[negative] [03:25] <fatcatmatt> ashfire908: getdeb.net had 2 packages for it, simple install, but its gone now :(
[positive] [03:25] <Foo1> jdong: I'm using fluxbox :)
[positive] [03:26] <don-o> joanki: open office and you already have it :)
[positive] [03:28] <ubotu> charlie: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [03:31] <stemount> :)
[positive] [03:32] <fatcatmatt> upfwnv03: if you install it, yes it does. i was running it before :)

[negative] [03:39] <stemount> i did :(
[negative] [03:39] <stemount> :(
[positive] [03:51] <Vlet> Anick: it's just eye candy? If you just want eye candy, get a caleidoscope :)
[negative] [03:55] <Anick> chowmeined: so no eye candy for me :(
[positive] [03:57] <BSG75> :jnc .. slightly confused as u can guess :)
[positive] [03:59] <LordLimecat> :)
[positive] [04:01] <charlie> I've customized the heck out of my Gusty install, and you just got me one step closer to being done. I congratulate you Falstius :)
[positive] [04:05] <charlie> eyemean,  no problem, glad to help :)
[positive] [04:06] <bobgill> I have a bunch of .ttf fonts in a mounted partition, how do I move them all to /usr/share/fonts/truetype?  Would it be: "sudo cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype" ?? Don't want to mess it up :)
[positive] [04:06] <LordLimecat> i mean, dont you sort of have to want a virus to get one on linux? (or be running wine) :)
[positive] [04:07] <bobgill> charlie: thanks it worked :) :)
[positive] [04:08] <IdleOne> LordLimecat: well then if you get a virus under wine then perhaps you need not run wine :)
[negative] [04:10] <LordLimecat> Falstius: yea, i suppose...hurts to think people fall for it :(
[negative] [04:18] <Paxton> I was hoping I'd be typing in this channel from ubuntu, but the disk partition utility on the install CD bugged out :(
[positive] [04:23] <charlie> m0u5e, No problem. Hope this works out for you too :)
[negative] [04:27] <Paxton> I need help with getting my windows partition resized so I can install ubuntu for a dual-boot. The install CD's partitioner just craps out on me :(
[positive] [04:27] <djlenoir> jnc: now why didn't i think of that... i will try that and switch it back over to see if it works. :)
[positive] [04:28] <eck0> :)
[positive] [04:30] <eck0> Ah sorry, thanks :)
[positive] [04:32] <Vlet> b4sic: probably lots :)
[positive] [04:32] <b4sic> vlet: are you one of them? :)
[negative] [04:32] <Paxton> I wish I knew enough to be considered a developer, all I know is basic C++ :(
[positive] [04:34] <eck0> I am Vlet :)

[positive] [05:02] <Paxton> seamus7: I'm gonna use wubi and just make sure everything's hunky dory in Gutsy. Hopefully I'll be back in this channel on it shortly :)
[positive] [05:06] <juancis14> hrp2171 to learn c programming dont need any packages, just a book :)
[positive] [05:09] <Madpilot> rayb0t, the whole purpose of compiz is to look shiny and eat resources. :)

[positive] [05:21] <juancis14> yeah, do it _tux :)
[positive] [05:22] <ubotu> KevinO: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [05:22] <MidnighToker> [[Charlie]]: thanks :)
[positive] [05:24] <Madpilot> josenj76, ubotu is a bot, just so you know. :)
[positive] [05:28] <nickrud> Jban: I tend to use that rather than the menu, it's faster :)
[negative] [05:31] <jimmygoon> epidodi, thats very strange... I don't have any xrdb processes :(
[positive] [05:34] <nickrud> Jban: just be prepared for the 'duh, I dunno's :)
[positive] [05:36] <crdlb> robbizzle, just don't expect the 3d effects to work :)
[positive] [05:38] <youknowme> gouranga, cool, now restart your system, be sure to have "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf" handy in case something goes sour :)
[negative] [05:40] <marx2k> damn.... gutsy (specifically NVidia) broke my system :(
[positive] [05:41]  * mon^rch whistles... gutsy is like perfect amazing :))
[negative] [05:41] <marx2k> I really wish that the Ubuntu install CDs still used gparted :(
[positive] [05:42] <marx2k> actually it looks like if you drop to a terminal in the Ubuntu install CD, gparted is installed... you just need to be able to run it :)
[positive] [05:43] <marx2k> Im running gparted within the Ubuntu install CD right now :)
[positive] [05:45] <IpMoo> :)
[positive] [05:46] <marx2k> VLet: Upgrade... now Im having to install :)
[positive] [05:48] <crdlb> tritium, yes I know :)
[negative] [05:49] <marx2k> too late now anyway, the disc is formatted :(
[positive] [05:49] <marx2k> jimmy: nah its like 150 gigs of roms :)
[negative] [05:51] <Rich4> jimmygoon: so we need to wait this out? :(
[positive] [05:53] <c_lisp> marx2k you can apt-get it quick anyways so it doesn't matter :)
[positive] [05:54] <marx2k> c_lisp: yeah but noobs needing help during install would not know that :)
[positive] [05:56] <marx2k> Dan: Oh! haha it lets my media center ubuntu computer run as a MAME arcade box :)
[positive] [05:59] <marx2k> Dan2552: Yeah itd be even better if I had a WII :)
[positive] [05:59] <marx2k> Right now my modded xbox serves as a media center via XBMC - does 1080i and everything :)
[negative] [06:00] <c_lisp> I can't get mugen to work on my xbox :(
[positive] [06:01] <marx2k> Dan2552, I blew my wad on this Toshiba 65" :)
[positive] [06:02] <marx2k> but since I haxx0r'd DishNET, my girlfriend loves me more now :) :)
[negative] [06:04] <Dan2552> super smash bros not coming out till ages in europe though >:(
[positive] [06:11] <nickrud> I'm the optomist ;:)
[positive] [06:11] <djlenoir> oh sweet! i finally stumbled upon a forum thread that gave me the answer i needed to get my bluetooth keyboard and mouse working... even after a reboot! = happiness! :)
[negative] [06:15] <jscinoz> Seveas, the falcon deb in your feisty repo is broken :(
[positive] [06:15] <jimmygoon> KevinO, enjoy synergy... it pretty much rocks! :)
[negative] [06:16] <simplyubuntu> :(
[negative] [06:25] <bodq> hi, I don't see my wacom tablet input devices in `xinput list`, although they're defined in xorg.conf and work :(
[positive] [06:26] <Vlet> fabio: $5 is not hard to come by for gaming pleasure :)
[positive] [06:27] <nickrud> simplyubuntu: dialup, yes, about 3k. And We got local radio stations on the phone line :)
[negative] [06:28] <jimmygoon> DanaG, :O tr3vino doesn't appear to have a gutsy repo yet :(
[positive] [06:36] <kwtm> LiMaO: Good job.  I am still using a 32-bit system but may one day end up using your script. :)
[negative] [06:43] <buntunub> nothing in the docs about how to stop random frequent lockups tho :(
[positive] [06:46] <jmagder> Any suggestions on fixing this? :)
[positive] [06:49] <jmagder> elliott541a: thanks anyways. :)  I just booted up into the installer again, and it looks like some how the partition was destroyed. Tht would be a problem.  I'll try again.  :)
[positive] [06:49] <hydrogen> and it doesn't work well after you use vim because you end up with random letters all over your screen :)
[positive] [06:51] <ubutom> sorry, im a bad impostor, hehe :)
[positive] [06:55] <troxor> luislo: no site, just my intuition, which at this hour probably isn't reliable :)
[positive] [07:01] <nickrud> h1st0: you are evil :)
[positive] [07:11] <Jadi> dystopianray: tnx :) will read it.
[positive] [07:19] <therealnanotube> dxdt: cool... :) what kind of hardware are you on?
[positive] [07:20] <troxor> tenemag: a friend of mine was instantly converted :)
[positive] [07:20] <therealnanotube> dxdt: ic. i'm on a laptop with an ati gfx card. so not sure if your mileage = my myleage. :)
[positive] [07:21] <dxdt> therealnanotube: well I never claimed it to be.  You should just try it if you feel like it.  Yeah I am a physics major.  :)
[positive] [07:23] <troxor> zparta: kwin has an option for window-specific settings, where you can specify for that window to always be under all other apps, and without a window border; then, just full screen that app, and voila! instant video background :)  you also have devilspie, which does that window-specific alteration for any desktop environment
[positive] [07:25] <therealnanotube> dxdt: yea, i know i'll try it, i was just curious to know before trying :) i was a physics major in undergrad at some point, too. ;)
[positive] [07:27] <gustavo_> vega- yeah? im not on linux right now... thanks :)
[positive] [07:27] <therealnanotube> dxdt: hehe yea, i'm doing a finance phd now. :)
[negative] [07:30] <LastLemming> That's "regression". Not a solution nor a workaround. We need to use our custom DSDT.aml/hex file (devels must modify the kernel to acept custom dsdt) or to FIX this bug, or ... just pick another distro :(
[positive] [07:36] <vega-> anyone done an upgrade from feisty to gutsy and has root on software raid? if so, did it go ok? :)
[positive] [07:37] <fatcatmatt> [chr0n0s]: I have compiz going with Emerald :)  imma happy camper
[positive] [07:44] <troxor> luislo: hmm, same here... I dunno- if you're on the bazaar version, compiled from src.. dunno what else could be the problem.. there has to be something dictating the desktop margin.. maybe `ps faux` will give you hints.. you can just start killing stuff (try nautilus/your-window-manager) at will, and see what happens :)
[negative] [07:52] <tvst> usser: not yet :(
[positive] [07:52] <usser> tvst: yea just checked :)
[positive] [08:04] <fatcatmatt> nikolai: now throw compiz and emerald on there and you should be golden.  add the reflective surface for compiz :)
[positive] [08:10] <lordprofit> yah just a simple coder :)  if i want games i have an xbox
[positive] [08:12] <fatcatmatt> simplechat: get an iso of windows and start over :)
[negative] [08:14] <Colro> dystopianray: If only I could afford a new gfx card atm :(
[negative] [08:15] <Ryuho> how is that not implemented :( on screenkeyboard?
[positive] [08:23] <Sorcererbob> I'll google it :)
[negative] [08:23] <mdalek> it takes longer to get to desktop from login than to boot from bios to login :(
[negative] [08:23] <mdalek> and my hdd is thrashing.... i've got 1gig ram :(
[positive] [08:30] <`eric-> i just want to say... gutsy is amazing. :)
[positive] [08:46] <Boumboum6> Heh. It's not like XP and Vista are always guaranteed to work out of the box either. :)
[positive] [08:50] <Boumboum6> freenode is the server, not the program you're using to get on freenode. :)
[positive] [08:51] <riotkittie> mcp_dk: :)
[negative] [08:54] <Boumboum6> ExRarne: sounds to me like one of the installs overwrote the other. :(   (a  newbie guess)
[positive] [08:56] <DUUUUUDE> i am now a full linux :)
[positive] [08:56] <Boumboum6> DUUUUDE: heh. It's one of the best Distros of linux I've seen...first one that recognized my wifi, my widescreen, and my nvidia video card right out of the box. :)
[positive] [08:57] <simplechat> wow, gusties default backround looks pretty damn hot :)
[positive] [08:58] <Boumboum6> I agree wi th riotkittie...luckily it's highly modifiable. :)
[negative] [08:58] <ExRarne> I didn't make any backsups because my brother has by external hard drive :(
[negative] [09:01] <aeshyamae> riotkittie: clicking the install again is not doing anything here:(
[positive] [09:03] <Boumboum6> h1s0: cool :)  I'm still a semi-newbie. :)
[negative] [09:06] <riotkittie> Morgwyr: i know i've seen other people mention the same thing here but i'm not sure how they resolved it :( maybe there's something on the forums...
[negative] [09:08] <Boumboum6> critt: I do not. :(
[positive] [09:09] <Boumboum6> neur1: :)  I went though that myself a number of times--I do not have 24/7 internet..I get online at wifi hotspots at the library...and have to interrupt downloads when the library closes. :)
[positive] [09:10] <Boumboum6> nickrud: heh. the best ones for ME, yes...maybe not so good for others. :)

[negative] [09:49] <gustavo_> ompaul " There are at least major two cases where one may wish to use boot options. Case 1: When trying to install, and the install freezes. Case 2: After a system has been installed and does not boot or the system needs adjustment. " i didnt see anything that might help :(
[positive] [10:39] <BoomSie> whoops, sounds familiar. You have the mixer issue too, sorry :)
[negative] [10:40] <BoomSie> no, a simple work around I have now, but fully fixed WITH an end mixer/master, no :(

[positive] [11:28] <rbs-tito> linux26: No problem :)
[positive] [11:31] <rbs-tito> ParanoyaM: Just a certain netiquette of writing in upper case. It makes it easier if you just state your problem and wait for an answer :)

[negative] [12:04] <raidproblem> saloxin: Yup I think that is what I have to do. Of course now I have a full windows install on a striped volume that I have to trash :(

[positive] [12:29] <IHK> before i go insane :), how do i give permission to write to me on a mounted disk, that's mounted with truecrypt(encrypted)? "sudo chown andreas crypt" gives the response "chown: changing ownership of `crypt': Read-only file system", first of all ls -l stil says root root, and second, its not a read only file system :S what am i doing wrong?..
[positive] [12:29] <rayb0t> deadsouls: that's what I did :)
[negative] [12:33] <sponix> saloxin:  these tards don't even list the rsync mirrors on the page anymore :(

[positive] [13:37] <detra> _keito_, I've been a windows nerd all my life ... I know everything about it ... but I have many times changed to linux but ended up changing back ...

[positive] [13:52] <IdleOne> VSpike: well then that is what you needed to do :) let it finish the upgrade and you will see the package appear later on. may have changed name so it needs to go packageA to packageB so it can notice " packageB is now packageA "
[positive] [13:52] <beni> myname: and "ubotu" is the Channel bot, he is a program why helps us to help people :)
[positive] [13:53] <asbani> beni: I don't like xchat, because I run my irc from terminal and screen, that i can log back into it from different computer or from work :)

[positive] [14:59] <lamego> svg, otherwise you could use a mini cd :)

[positive] [15:19] <damianl> LiMaO: :)
[positive] [15:21] <kolla> So, instead of asking a question, I say "kvm in gutsy is broken - true or false!" :)
[positive] [15:25] <stemount> hey :)
[negative] [15:26] <Moduliz0r> what's wrong with the bluetooth things??? I can't browse a device :(
[negative] [15:27] <Andycasss> how to set a shorter delay when the source of mount cant be found? Right now it takes 5 min till it boots up (Fstab) :(
[negative] [15:29] <ShapeshifterO> I really need help :( I nuked my ubuntu installation. I now need to chroot into my installation via the live cd, but I don't know how to do that. Can someone help me? please!
[negative] [15:33] <kaminix> stefg: Yes, I was just on it, then I logged out to log back into a fancier colorprompt :(

[positive] [15:53] <GoingGibbon> I cant upgrade! Cant seem to fix this issue by myself! Does anyone know how to help me? :)
[positive] [15:55] <andre_> LjL:  tx for the help,  I'll see if that work on the next update :)
[positive] [15:55] <nemo_home> LiMaO: would you have any speculation on that front, or should I go poke around, maybe nag a dev or two? :)
[positive] [15:55] <nemo_home> ion_bidon: no clue on the initrd thing, since I tend to take error messages literally, personally :)
[positive] [16:00] <ben___> :)
[positive] [16:00] <nemo_home> mc44: keep in mind I bought this ubuntu box from dell to encourage their business decision :)
[negative] [16:03] <Op3r> :(
[negative] [16:04] <Op3r> cos Im using a low end laptop :(
[negative] [16:05] <xsacha> LjL: yeah it works in KDE. not working here in gnome :(
[positive] [16:05] <LM22> ktorrent rules :)
[positive] [16:05] <jdong> LM22: ah, ok. ktorrent rocks indeed :)
[negative] [16:06] <stemount> its fine. but KDE is really lame on memory :(
[positive] [16:07] <nemo_home> jdong: XFCE4 :)
[positive] [16:07] <nemo_home> jdong: my laptop with 96MiB of memory runs XFCE4 :)
[positive] [16:08] <jdong> nemo_home: of course, if you like GNOME apps.... KDE is pretty useless :)
[positive] [16:08] <jdong> nemo_home: if you use majority GTK apps, I would never tell you to try KDE :)
[positive] [16:11] <Draggin> noo1 - Aha :) Thanks very much
[positive] [16:12] <nemo_home> vocx: and I'm looking for a decent high-powered gnome burning tool :)
[positive] [16:12] <jdong> xsacha: ok, point. that's not the intended purpose of mplayer :)
[positive] [16:13] <jessie^^> xsacha, it doesn't appear to be compiz doing it either, which is good :)
[negative] [16:14] <mc44> jdong: xgl/firefox usually take me above that after a while :(
[positive] [16:14] <mc44> jdong: but soon it will be ding dong dead! :)
[positive] [16:15] <jdong> mc44: let's hope so :)
[positive] [16:15] <felipe__> saloxin: yeah, pretty noisy :)
[positive] [16:17] <stemount> :)
[negative] [16:17] <stemount> :(*
[positive] [16:20] <jessie^^> xsacha, stemount: thank you for looking at this with me. i guess this is a 'just gutsy' thing :)
[positive] [16:21] <stemount> that don't conflict with anything else :)
[positive] [16:22] <stemount> it is very good mundungus :)
[positive] [16:22] <stemount> mundungus, bit heavy on memory but :)

[positive] [16:50] <xyz> murkyMurk, john_preist: thanks guys, it works great! :) Now... Do any of you know how to listen to ShoutCast which I usually accessed through WinAmp on windows? I've seen that I could possibly install Wine (which I have) and then mount my new NTFS r/w partitions, but I'd rather be able to run a native linux program... Another question I have is where I can check whether my web camera can take shots from Linux?
[positive] [16:51] <xyz> :)
[positive] [16:52] <Draggin> Thanks for the help... I'm way further now :)
[positive] [16:54] <xyz> john_priest aha :) murkyMurk: thx

[positive] [17:52] <KR-data> nickrud, thanks again :)
[positive] [17:52] <raidproblem> poningru: maybe it's wrong... Well, as long as I won't lose data I don't mind the errors :)
[positive] [17:57] <[[Charlie]]> Sorry pici thought i turned that off. It's off now :)
[positive] [17:57] <Pici> [[Charlie]]: Okay :)
[positive] [17:59] <nickrud> garu: grub counts from 0 , if you remember that it's easy :)

[negative] [18:01] <FireHazard17> :(
[positive] [18:02] <Traveler6> :)

[positive] [18:14] <Iggi> :)
[positive] [18:15] <raidproblem> great, thanks :)
[positive] [18:21] <nickrud> aata: 1. do the get command. 2. burn that, and /var/cache/apt/archives/* to a cd. 3. Install. 4. copy the files back to /var/cache/apt/archives on the new install. 5. run the set command on the mypackages file. 6. Watch your system update, without downloading :)
[positive] [18:26] <nickrud> :)
[positive] [18:27] <aata> :)
[positive] [18:29] <nickrud> vocx: yesterday I was the 1337 'th user. Destiny :)

[negative] [18:33] <Fryguy--> god i hate my terminal colors :(
[negative] [18:33] <kst-> how do I setup my s-video output to TV (pal-b) with ati fglrx on gutsy? anything special? my former solution from feisty got broken with the upgrade :(
[positive] [18:33] <stemount> aata thats fine :)
[positive] [18:34] <fuligin> envy does wonders even for newbies like me :)
[positive] [18:39] <troxor> atouk: sudo -i to get to the root user's account, make up a really long random password, set it, and then forget it :)
[positive] [18:40] <troxor> aata: just answering questions :)
[positive] [18:41] <nickrud> Fryguy--: doable. I'll mail you a bunch of dvd's :)
[positive] [18:42] <nickrud> aata: install without doing the backup :)
[positive] [18:42] <kiru> nickrud: found it :) thx
[positive] [18:44] <ompaul> aata, the use of * does not disguise the need for you to avoid the word fully in irc - you should have checked that also :)
[positive] [18:46] <buck_> ubotu: Hello :)
[positive] [18:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hello :) - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[positive] [18:50] <kiru> after deleting everything, purging and reinstalling, it is gone :)
[positive] [18:54] <Ajzo> Paddy_EIRE: little to much to do instead one simple CLICK :)
[positive] [18:54] <Box|UK> ati  xpress 200 FTW :)
[negative] [18:54] <Dialntone> im having a lot of problems trying to get an avi file to play :(
[positive] [18:54] <tehlaser> or you can hack in gconf-manager, but that's not exactly recommended.  :)
[positive] [18:56] <nickrud> ldrada: heh. small case vs caps. About right :)
[positive] [18:58] <tehlaser> alill0: glad you made it back.  :)
[positive] [18:58] <Ajzo> Ashex: it is enough just to clikc middle click and it is downloading instead launching in browser :)
[positive] [19:03] <Ajzo> Ashex: i'm gonna change it manually but it works as i can see :))
[positive] [19:04] <BaD_CrC> :)
[positive] [19:09] <Gin> joanki, I also said that when I first get to know Ubuntu. ;) but now , it is sooo easy :)
[positive] [19:12] <local> iotkittie,  :)
[positive] [19:12] <troxor> kriel: higher learning curve, yes; but, the kicker is that there exists an edge :)
[positive] [19:13] <ali110> garu : well thanks a lot for trying to help that was so kind :)
[positive] [19:15] <beni> DerDritte: okay :) But mine grabs the covers automatically and has a clean and simple UI ;)
[positive] [19:15] <riotkittie> yw :)
[positive] [19:17] <beni> nanbudh: yes, install it :)
[positive] [19:18] <flick> beni, i'm serious :)
[positive] [19:21] <troxor> garu: it's a safer answer than 'of course!' and then have your wireless card not work :) but yes, in general, it should be fine, provided the card's hardware supports wpa
[negative] [19:21] <Mishaal> does anyone know how to copy ubuntu 7.10 from torrent to nero? i am using Windows just now :(
[negative] [19:23] <Mishaal> Gin: i want to copy it to CD :(. i searched in google but i couln'd find :(
[positive] [19:25] <Mishaal> thanks kishan and Paddy_EIRE_ :)
[positive] [19:26] <michael_> :)
[positive] [19:26] <wolferine> thats too bad Paddy_EIRE_ :)
[positive] [19:27] <wolferine> Paddy_EIRE_, obviously :)
[positive] [19:27] <garu> nanbudh nah...no problems with downloading anything here :)
[negative] [19:28] <the_darkside_986> i tried running compiz but 3d games like sauerbraten kept shrinking to windowed mode instead of fullscreen, and it would freeze up. :(
[positive] [19:29] <troxor> kriel: progress :)  install xfonts-base, or just xfonts-*
[positive] [19:30] <troxor> kriel: I believe -base is the only one you need, but the foolproof way is just to install them all :)
[positive] [19:31] <Mishaal> good, just now i have Windows, if i follow it i will have ubuntu :)
[negative] [19:33] <Mishaal> Paddy_EIRE_:  but i want to install it and keep Windows. i'm new to linux :(
[positive] [19:33] <Box|UK> i burned the disc as iso was able to view web pages  and browse the web while it installed :)
[negative] [19:34] <kkathman> Paddy_EIRE_,   gnome-commander is a bit better, but not too configurable (i.e. colors, background,) and you can only have the two panels :(
[positive] [19:47] <ubotu> Ghone[fark]: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [19:50] <beni> riddareralf: go find the button! :)
[positive] [19:51] <flick> gnome rocks :)
[positive] [19:51] <flick> riotkittie, nautilus rocks :) thanks for pointing out i can do what i want in nautilus too... i think i assumed things too quickly, i apologize for that
[positive] [19:53] <beni> EminX: Where's the prob? :)
[positive] [19:56] <nn> claudio75: it could be a slight change in the driver since fiesty or maybe just driver got overlooked :)
[positive] [20:01] <beni> John117: Or just setup an old linux computer which shares music on your lan or stuff :) Just little tasks to learn about this OS
[positive] [20:11] <Phocion> ah i was typing it worng :)
[positive] [20:16] <John117> box|uk that's okay. I was using my laptop as an experiement so i could get comfortable with the install before switching on my desktop.   I think i'm ready. :)
[negative] [20:17] <pubuntu> i need help :( the guided partitioning won't let me go below 50%

[positive] [21:56] <Pici> Sp4rKy: try ##programming :)
[positive] [21:57] <crossout> MasterShrek, I solved the problem :D. it turns out while I was scrambling trying to figure out how to fix the boot, I loaded the optimize settings in the BIOS, needless to say that screwd things up :). Again thank you very much :).
[positive] [22:01] <Pinchiukas> I don't do those :)
[positive] [22:03] <akorn> leobru: you're welcome :) hopefully that solves it

[positive] [22:26] <PriceChild> billy, most are, no need to mention it :)
[positive] [22:26] <asbani> MaxRandor: people might shout at me telling you this, but I'd recommend a fresh gutsy install, download gutsy.iso and do a fresh install :)
[positive] [22:26] <cpt> PriceChild, nothing is working after i tryed changing the standard driver setings :)
[positive] [22:27] <Tranto1> cpt: In fact I don't know where that file is in! :) When I installed Feisty, it configured with the correct resolution without doing anything else

[positive] [23:03] <Vlet> riotkittie: compiz is flashier than metacity is flashier than fluxbox is flashier than vt200 :)

[positive] [23:30] <Creed> lauchazombie, links is pretty sweet, comes in handy at work (pretty restrictive firewall...ssh is open though :)).
[positive] [23:31] <Creed> Pelo, I'm not telling people not to use newever utorrent or utorrent in general because of the new owners, I'm simply expressing my opinion on the matter. If I am misinformed then thats my problem :) Everyone has faults...I'll learn the truth when I feel like it, but for now I'd rather just stick to my beliefs.
[positive] [23:33] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [23:34] <Innomen> thanks all :)
[positive] [23:37] <Fastn> d4rkmonkey, Oh this works great :) , what was the only two problems with this chipset?

[negative] [23:47] <bobgill> jrib: I did "Mark for complete removal" and now it's not in the list anymore :(
[positive] [23:50] <hans_> flick: or something :)
[positive] [23:53] <jdong> vocx: point is, now that it is built the way I packaged it, the end user won't have to worry about anything. It runs with EVERY JRE in our repositories now :)
[positive] [23:55] <jdong> lauchazombie: it's Ubuntu -- it's what we do for each other :)

[00:36] <Boumboum5> agwells: Your problem is beyond my beginner's competence... I don't know how to tweak your system to get your USB devices to work properly. Hopefully someone else will know.  I need to go now.. :(
[00:42] <Boumboum5> gavintlgold: that's a bit beyond my competence. :(  I'm still rather newbie-ish myself. At worst case, reinstall ubuntu.
[00:44] <Kodemage> tag: you're telling me :(

[04:18] <Paxton> I was hoping I'd be typing in this channel from ubuntu, but the disk partition utility on the install CD bugged out :(
[04:27] <Paxton> I need help with getting my windows partition resized so I can install ubuntu for a dual-boot. The install CD's partitioner just craps out on me :(
[04:32] <Paxton> I wish I knew enough to be considered a developer, all I know is basic C++ :(
[04:37] <Paxton> seamus7 I am not using Vista. Running XP on a Dell, no system CD :(

[05:17] <Scabdates> IpMoo: ok...but it didn't :(
[05:31] <jimmygoon> epidodi, thats very strange... I don't have any xrdb processes :(
[05:40] <marx2k> damn.... gutsy (specifically NVidia) broke my system :(
[05:41] <marx2k> I really wish that the Ubuntu install CDs still used gparted :(

[06:28] <jimmygoon> DanaG, :O tr3vino doesn't appear to have a gutsy repo yet :(
[06:43] <buntunub> nothing in the docs about how to stop random frequent lockups tho :(
[07:30] <LastLemming> That's "regression". Not a solution nor a workaround. We need to use our custom DSDT.aml/hex file (devels must modify the kernel to acept custom dsdt) or to FIX this bug, or ... just pick another distro :(
[07:52] <tvst> usser: not yet :(
[08:14] <Colro> dystopianray: If only I could afford a new gfx card atm :(

[09:01] <aeshyamae> riotkittie: clicking the install again is not doing anything here:(

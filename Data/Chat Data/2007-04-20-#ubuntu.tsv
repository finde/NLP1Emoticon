[positive]	[12:01]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see @HLINK or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[negative]	[12:01]	<nxspnt>	xtknight, all I know is that if I use the ATA133 style IDE hard drive, then I can get linux to install, if I use SATA then it is hit or miss on the distro installer seeing the SATA controller.  Some see it and get kernel panics and others never see the controller

Ubuntu uses the APT package management system, which can automatically install packages (i.e. programs and libraries) from repositories (which are Internet sites provided by Ubuntu). the official repositories have four components: Main, Restricted, Universe, and Multiverse. the package you are looking for (firestarter) is in Universe, which is not enabled by default. go to

[negative]	[12:43]	<Stoffer>	is it possible that the gnome network manager is reporting a 50% wireless signal strength while the actual strength is much higher?  Is there a way i could check it?  wmwave also says 50%...

[negative]	[12:52]	<eternaljoy>	penguin42: if I install feisty on a hard drive partition, will the installer create the swap partition it needs by itself?  Or do I hve to first manusally create a 1Gig partition for the swap file?

[neutral]	[12:52]	<tehquickness>	Does anyone have any sugestions?

[negative]	[12:52]	<RedNeckBoy>	Angeluz, no but they can't leave us without support either... they will probably do at least good proprietary stuff... they have to... i mean we're a lot of ppl using linux now and GROWING
[positive]	[12:52]	<Angeluz>	RedNeckBoy: But you really should take a look at Phoronix. There will be a huge article about the delevopment of Linux-drivers in cooperation with ATI/AMD.

[negative]	[12:52]	<LjL>	eternaljoy: yes, but i wouldn't call it a good idea
[neutral]	[12:52]	<penguin42>	eternaljoy: You normally have a separate partition for swap, it's not essential but it is normal
[neutral]	[12:52]	<_Neil>	askar: Does it play stuff in firefox?
[neutral]	[12:52]	<Angeluz>	RedNeckBoy: I agree.
[positive]	[12:52]	<magnetron>	Stoffer: 100% of what? those figures doesn't really measure the speed, it is only comparable in the same software
[negative]	[12:52]	<_Neil>	thats what i really need
[negative]	[12:52]	<mwe>	milage: supposedly they're working on a 64bit linux release

[negative]	[12:53]	<ytsestef>	z987k, ok I just thought this is weird because in any other distro getting sound is the easiest thing through alsa...

[negative]	[12:53]	<eternaljoy>	LjL: why not?
[negative]	[12:53]	<milage>	In the mean time, is there a decent reverse engineered flash plugin?

[neutral]	[12:53]	<RedNeckBoy>	Angeluz, I never read about BSD
[positive]	[12:53]	<magnetron>	milage: i heard that gnash is the best, but it is till alpha

[neutral]	[12:53]	<bimberi>	wehttamb: just run update-manager
[positive]	[12:53]	<penguin42>	Sheesh - there are people here having problems with one sound card - and you want to use two at once :-)

[neutral]	[12:54]	<eternaljoy>	z987k: why?
[negative]	[12:54]	<penguin42>	eternaljoy: Yes - I'm not sure if the installer will try and insist on it
[neutral]	[12:54]	<wehttamb>	k
[negative]	[12:54]	<milage>	I can live with that as long as it doesn't crash bigger things than my browser, i suppose
[positive]	[12:54]	<LjL>	eternaljoy: because 1) even if you have lots of RAM, it can be demonstrated that swap space still helps  2) hibernation won't work without swap  3) out of memory errors on Linux are BAD
[negative]	[12:54]	<z987k>	eternaljoy, in case you use all your RAM
[negative]	[12:54]	<Angeluz>	RedNeckBoy: I don't do that very often either.
[negative]	[12:54]	<mwe>	milage: some people run a 32bit chrooted firefox to get flash

[neutral]	[12:54]	<_Neil>	anyone ? How to play realmedia in firefox?
[negative]	[12:54]	<eternaljoy>	LjL: bad in what way?  they can cause hardware failure?
[negative]	[12:54]	<Sombrero>	The release notes for 7.04 mention that 256mb ram should be sufficient to install and run Ubuntu.  Can anyone here verify that it would be worthwhile to actually do so with a P2 400mhz machine?
[neutral]	[12:54]	<Angeluz>	LjL: I can agree on the latter.
[positive]	[12:54]	<_Neil>	It tells me i need a plugin, and to install it
[neutral]	[12:54]	<z987k>	if you dont create swap and max out the ram wont the system crash?
[negative]	[12:54]	<milage>	Seems like the one I have is 64bit

[negative]	[12:56]	<Sombrero>	magnetron, ok, so that would probably be a good idea then.  Are all things more-or-less the same?  Still has wpa support for example?
[neutral]	[12:56]	<justintime32>	haha
[negative]	[12:56]	<penguin42>	Dante123: Any other errors - it's unusual for that to be the only one
[negative]	[12:56]	<IndyGunFreak>	i downloaded feisty via torrent at an average of 500k, no probs at all.
[negative]	[12:56]	<LjL>	eternaljoy: well, swap on a USB stick is, conversely, a very bad idea. USB sticks are flash memory, and flash memory can only be written to a finite number of time. if you put swap on a flash memory stick, you'll ruin it.

[neutral]	[12:56]	<interfear>	7.04 is out now?

[negative]	[12:56]	<Dante123>	starts the upgrade.....then I get that error.....in the box it says...something about could be network problem
[positive]	[12:56]	<Dante123>	but network is fine
[negative]	[12:56]	<eternaljoy>	LjL: in fact, according to the install insturctions, the  USB stick version doesnt create  swap partition at all

[neutral]	[12:57]	<MacSlow>	interfear, depending where you sit on the globe
[negative]	[12:57]	<penguin42>	eternaljoy: It can work fine as long as you have plenty of pysical ram; still it can still be more efficient to have some swap so that Linux can push infrequently used stuff out to swap and let you use your ram for more common stuff
[neutral]	[12:57]	<dreamcastjack>	i have all the codecs installed by Amarok wont read them.
[negative]	[12:57]	<DanaG>	Don'tcha love the character droppings?

[neutral]	[12:57]	<interfear>	MacSlow: I sit in new jersey
[negative]	[12:57]	<Sombrero>	magnetron, alright, I'll try Xubuntu then. Thanks
[negative]	[12:57]	<eternaljoy>	penguin42: yeah
[neutral]	[12:57]	<DanaG>	/* this thingy: (        , )  : is cool for debugging processes. */
[neutral]	[12:57]	<Flannel>	Skygge: make sure youre fully updated
[negative]	[12:58]	<variant>	eternaljoy: if you have plenty of ram and all you do is browse the net etc then there is no need for swap
[negative]	[12:58]	<sylvisj>	Ok - trying to install xubuntu. Had some issues because of my 8800gts, but using the vesa driver fixed that. What am I supposed to login as?
[negative]	[12:58]	<Skygge>	meh, latest wine is the ghay. but okay.
[positive]	[12:58]	<Skygge>	Flannel, thanks
[negative]	[12:58]	<LjL>	eternaljoy: no, it simply means that it *can* run, and that the disadvantages are fewer than that of putting a swap file on a USB key (read: hardware failure)
[negative]	[12:58]	<eternaljoy>	variant: i have 1 Gig Ram
[negative]	[12:58]	<Dante123>	should I change my repository listing from Main server to USA??
[neutral]	[12:58]	<milage>	Skygge?
[positive]	[12:58]	<Angeluz>	sylvisj: With the login you creating during the install-process. :)

[negative]	[12:58]	<sylvisj>	Angeluz, that's the problem - the installer didn't run because of the X fuckup
[negative]	[12:58]	<ghostisgray>	sup i am a complete noob, and am interested in installing ubuntu on my laptop, it already has win-xp on it. All i want to know is if i goto install ubuntu will there be a dual os setup thing i can follow?

[negative]	[12:59]	<TUTUx>	Dante123, it's not that big deal if you are already in US
[negative]	[12:59]	<sylvisj>	LjL, ok.
[negative]	[12:59]	<Skygge>	milage, I've been holding off updating latest wine as it screws with Steam, but I guess I'll have to to do an upgrade
[negative]	[12:59]	<Dante123>	could this error just be network congestion
[negative]	[12:59]	<bruenig>	rhythmbox crashes everytime I try to play something with it
[neutral]	[12:59]	<sylvisj>	Angelus, How would I run the installer?
[negative]	[12:59]	<DanaG>	For example: doing some long-winded process:
[neutral]	[12:59]	<DanaG>	startend
[negative]	[12:59]	<Dante123>	I'm in canada actually
[neutral]	[12:59]	<magnetron>	ghostisgray: hi! yes it is.
[positive]	[12:59]	<variant>	eternaljoy: then any swap you have will probably never be used.. nowadays though with huge hard disks there is no reason not to have alittle swap.. 100MB is more than enough if u have gig ram
[neutral]	[12:59]	<RedNeckBoy>	Canada WE Rock!
[positive]	[12:59]	<Angeluz>	Skygge: Are you in a live-cd environment?
[positive]	[12:59]	<milage>	Skygge, I was merely commenting on your choice of nick :p

[neutral]	[12:59]	<ghostisgray>	and widescreen*
[negative]	[12:59]	<Angeluz>	variant: No, it's not.
[positive]	[01:00]	<eternaljoy>	variant: really? 100MB is enough?  I always used 1Gig swap.
[negative]	[01:00]	<bruenig>	rhythmbox doesn't work, wine doesn't work, I get artifacts like crazy, what is the deal with feisty
[negative]	[01:00]	<Skygge>	Angeluz, no, not live cd... edgy install
[neutral]	[01:00]	<Dante123>	I got the same error using canada server...so I changed to Main but still no dice.
[negative]	[01:00]	<Angeluz>	Or I am doing something wrong.
[negative]	[01:00]	<Skygge>	milage, my name? you know what it means?
[neutral]	[01:00]	<sylvisj>	How would I run the xubuntu installer?
[neutral]	[01:00]	<milage>	Indeed I do.
[negative]	[01:00]	<variant>	eternaljoy: that is seriously excessive.. but you probably have 400GB hard disk so doesn't make any real difference
[negative]	[01:00]	<penguin42>	eternaljoy: On some oldee Unix's you really needed as much swap as physical RAM - but that hasn't been true for years
[positive]	[01:00]	<magnetron>	eternaljoy: i use 2GB swap, to be on the safe side ... =)
[positive]	[01:00]	<KNY>	haha you jerks, I can't even install gnomebaker since the mirrors are thrashed :)
[negative]	[01:00]	<bruenig>	sylvisj, I would recommend staying away from xubuntu, I fresh installed it and it is total crap
[positive]	[01:00]	<Angeluz>	Skygge: Sorry, I confused you with sylvisj. :)
[negative]	[01:00]	<LjL>	variant, eternaljoy: swap theoretically *always* improves performance. that's because, if you've got swap, the kernel can decide to swap out an unused process in favor of file caching. that holds even if you have 4 gigs of RAM, just as long as you've got more files than RAM
[neutral]	[01:00]	<Skygge>	Angeluz, np
[positive]	[01:00]	<bruenig>	KNY, change to brazil
[neutral]	[01:01]	<sylvisj>	angeluz, the xubuntu desktop/install CD.
[negative]	[01:01]	<KNY>	bruenig, it's going, just very slowly
[neutral]	[01:01]	<magnetron>	!slow | KNY
[negative]	[01:01]	<variant>	eternaljoy: the 2times ram = swap size was true for computers with 32MB ram
[positive]	[01:01]	<ubotu>	KNY: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[negative]	[01:01]	<LjL>	variant: 100MB seems very little to me, especially considering that, for hibernation to work, you need swap to be at least as much as RAM
[positive]	[01:01]	<ghostisgray>	is there ATI video card support? and widescreen resolutions?
[negative]	[01:01]	<KNY>	not a huge deal
[negative]	[01:01]	<nir_ai>	I have an nvidia 8800 GTX, and once I enable the nvidia driver and restart, the x server fails to start! how do I roll this back?
[negative]	[01:01]	<wehttamb>	"i did the ""sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"" how do i know it it has upgraded from the beta?"
[neutral]	[01:01]	<penguin42>	LjL: I also get the feeling sometimes the kernel just ain't happy without swap - I've seen machines feel very grindy without swap even when they don't use much when they have it
[negative]	[01:01]	<eternaljoy>	ok ty
[positive]	[01:01]	<variant>	LjL: ah, forgot all about hibernation etc.. that is a very good point that I totaly ignored.
[negative]	[01:01]	<Angeluz>	sylvisj: So, you just booted without installing?

[negative]	[01:07]	<Angeluz>	sylvisj: I don't know, to be honest. But if none of the live-cd options work for you, you're forced to do the text-install. And that's on the alternate-cd.
[negative]	[01:07]	<bimberi>	foug: no, no new versions, just updates to this one (7.04)
[positive]	[01:08]	<nuked_omen>	is there a torrent file for 7.04, cuz the mirrors are hammered i think

[neutral]	[01:27]	<void^>	Ashex: use a samba or nfs share, or mount ssh using sshfs

[neutral]	[01:39]	<ajehuk>	Mr_Giraffe - heres is the kicker - if you could buy a PC with ubuntu preloaded and all the hardware set up (much like OEM Windows) you wouldnt need to see the commandline..
[positive]	[01:39]	<TaJMoX>	linux can be easy to use and still be linux.   its the kernel that really matters
[neutral]	[01:39]	<Mr_Giraffe>	felicito, 'sudo gparted'?

[neutral]	[01:46]	<mike1>	ajehuk: They both look mint
[negative]	[01:46]	<jrib>	ahmed: paste your error on @HLINK and then give the channel the link, do not paste directly into the channel.  Thanks
[neutral]	[01:46]	<stefg>	IdleOne: ahmed
[negative]	[01:46]	<SubMOA>	bimberi, YES!  my first time ever on a linux box was Ubuntu Edgy Eft and being a COMPLETE newbie I added Beryl (before it was a package you could install, btw) and all sorts of neat programs.
[positive]	[01:46]	<variant>	absum: run the update again, it may connect this time. otherwise try a different mirror
[positive]	[01:46]	<TaJMoX>	Tell : once you have it installed and configured - its just as easy as windows in my oppinion
[negative]	[01:46]	<Mr_Giraffe>	ryeth, you aren't registered with nickserv...
[negative]	[01:46]	<ryeth>	how do i do that?
[negative]	[01:47]	<SubMOA>	bimberi, this room was a god-send, though, becuase if I hit a snag, I'd just come here.
[positive]	[01:47]	<bimberi>	Tell: it's getting easier.  Ubuntu is an excellent choice for the newbie.
[negative]	[01:47]	<magnetron>	livingdaylight: go on, ask your question
[negative]	[01:47]	<ryeth>	didn't know i had to register lol
[positive]	[01:47]	<ajehuk>	mike1 - ah I could disagree with you there, but I'll save that for some other time :)
[negative]	[01:47]	<wondering>	How would I make a command line only LiveCD that's based on ubuntu-7.04-alternate.iso ? Could someone help me please? I've searched all over Google and I can't seem to find anything :(
[neutral]	[01:47]	<IncredibleHink>	jrib, k
[neutral]	[01:47]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, i need repos list
[positive]	[01:47]	<Mr_Giraffe>	bimberi, i think it's a great choice for anyone, unless you're crazy :P
[negative]	[01:47]	<dimeotane>	wondering: try the server
[positive]	[01:47]	<bimberi>	Mr_Giraffe: :)
[positive]	[01:47]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, the definitive list to update my repos
[neutral]	[01:47]	<magnetron>	livingdaylight: you have deleted the list?
[negative]	[01:47]	<dimeotane>	the server version is what you want
[negative]	[01:47]	<disasm>	wondering: get the server cd
[negative]	[01:47]	<mike1>	"ajehuk: ok the  menus are a little ""loaded"""
[neutral]	[01:47]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list ?
[negative]	[01:47]	<Mr_Giraffe>	to be honest i don't have time to get every single piece of hardware working on my computer
[negative]	[01:47]	<SubMOA>	I want to upgrade but I downloaded automatix :O(
[positive]	[01:48]	<bimberi>	SubMOA: cool :)
[negative]	[01:48]	<L33>	!flash
[negative]	[01:48]	<wondering>	disasm: Er, I mean make a custom LiveCD.
[positive]	[01:48]	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: @HLINK - See also @HLINK - But please use free formats if you can: @HLINK
[negative]	[01:48]	<absum>	variant, is it me your talking to? im confused by what your saying
[neutral]	[01:48]	<ubotu>	Flash 9 (Final release) is now available for dapper-backports and edgy-backports. See !backports and !flash
[neutral]	[01:48]	<Mr_Giraffe>	SubMOA, just install it
[negative]	[01:48]	<wondering>	dimeotane: I want to make a custom LiveCD, not install a command line system.
[neutral]	[01:48]	<bimberi>	SubMOA: not so cool (automatix) :|
[negative]	[01:48]	<xq>	wondering: The command to BURN your LiveCD via the command line in *nix?
[neutral]	[01:48]	<VR_>	!md5sum
[positive]	[01:48]	<ubotu>	To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see @HLINK for more
[neutral]	[01:48]	<Flannel>	SubMOA: Backup, and cross your fingers.
[negative]	[01:48]	<disasm>	wondering: ah, that's a little more difficult, it requires a lot of pain and suffering
[negative]	[01:48]	<magnetron>	livingdaylight: why should you edit the list in the first place? is something wrong?
[neutral]	[01:48]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, no, i've just installed Feisty and need to max my sources list so i can install everything i need codecs etc
[negative]	[01:48]	<SubMOA>	Mr_Giraffe, I've heard horror stories with automatix and upgrades over an existing version.
[neutral]	[01:48]	<xq>	I think it just wants to burn a CD using the command line (ISO)?
[positive]	[01:48]	<xq>	he*/she* not it. :P
[negative]	[01:48]	<SubMOA>	Flannel, any good backup utilities you know of?
[negative]	[01:48]	<wondering>	xq: *No* Like I said, I want to *make* a custom LiveCD based on a command line only system.
[positive]	[01:49]	<ahmed>	does having automatix installed will affect the upgrade process ?
[negative]	[01:49]	<aoirthoir>	:(
[neutral]	[01:49]	<Mr_Giraffe>	oh...i don't use it.

[negative]	[01:49]	<xq>	Oh
[negative]	[01:49]	<aoirthoir>	i cant get video on my laptop with fiesty
[positive]	[01:49]	<xq>	wondering: Heh, that would be quite a lot of work :)
[negative]	[01:49]	<AnRkey_>	if i use jidgo to make a dvd in 3 months time will it make an iso that includes the updates up and till then?
[negative]	[01:49]	<aoirthoir>	even on the safe video
[negative]	[01:49]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, I'll let you know how mine went in a couple of hours...upgrading now...and yes, I've used Automatix2 on this box
[negative]	[01:49]	<SubMOA>	"ahmed, from what I've heard, automatix ""breaks"" your system and causes bugs... at least it did when it was dapper to edgy"
[negative]	[01:49]	<ryeth>	Mr_Giraffe, give me a minute, i'm reading about registering my nickname
[neutral]	[01:49]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, can you not paste me your sources list?
[positive]	[01:49]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, rgr, thanks.

[negative]	[01:49]	<kev_b>	"anybody getting an inexplicable ""not enough free disk space"" error??"
[negative]	[01:49]	<ryeth>	i'm a n00b  haha, sorry

[positive]	[01:49]	<magnetron>	livingdaylight: the original list is fine!
[negative]	[01:49]	<Mr_Giraffe>	you do /msg nickserv register password (i think...)

[neutral]	[01:49]	<magnetron>	!codecs | livingdaylight
[negative]	[01:49]	<aoirthoir>	i mean i dont get video...
[negative]	[01:49]	<disasm>	wondering: it seems to be down though
[neutral]	[01:49]	<aoirthoir>	nada..no screen
[neutral]	[01:50]	<wondering>	Is that based on Feisty though?
[negative]	[01:50]	<Ltar>	"what is the ""alternate"" cd for fiesty? is that somehow different from... a standard version? I'm trying to upgrade with a CD, but nothing is happening. do I need to alternate CD?"
[positive]	[01:50]	<Mr_Giraffe>	ryeth, xq has it
[neutral]	[01:50]	<ryeth>	nickserv is where i enter my name?
[neutral]	[01:50]	<radge>	hiya everyone
[negative]	[01:50]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, ahmed....SOME say that happens...hasn't happened to me or any of my friends that have used it, but YMMV
[neutral]	[01:50]	<stefg>	!alternate
[negative]	[01:50]	<ryeth>	and then i have to type a password in?
[positive]	[01:50]	<ubotu>	"The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an ""expert"" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a ""Live"" CD."

[neutral]	[01:50]	<ubotu>	Yum!
[neutral]	[01:50]	<Mr_Giraffe>	ryeth, once you do that do /msg nickserv IDENTIFY <password>
[negative]	[01:50]	<ahmed>	i have automatix and easy ubuntu, should i forget about upgrading ?
[neutral]	[01:50]	<Flannel>	livingdaylight: correct
[negative]	[01:50]	<xq>	NickServ is where you register your name to yourself so no one else can use it.
[neutral]	[01:50]	<Goldy>	anybody have gfire working on fiesty?
[positive]	[01:50]	<Mr_Giraffe>	but ryeth, don't put brackets around your password ;] 
[positive]	[01:50]	<xq>	That's all, you already have your name :) You can change it via /nick <nickname>

[neutral]	[01:50]	<livingdaylight>	Flannel, hrmmm...
[neutral]	[01:50]	<radge>	anyone see this?
[positive]	[01:50]	<radge>	:P
[negative]	[01:50]	<chemisus>	anyone know where to find the md5sum value for fiesty iso?
[neutral]	[01:50]	<alteroo>	] /part
[neutral]	[01:50]	<deepsa>	hi guys. i have installed ubuntu fiesty on my lenovo laptop but my screen resolution is not according to the widescreen (1280x800) it's 1024x768.
[neutral]	[01:50]	<TaJMoX>	radge : no
[neutral]	[01:50]	<etplayer_fiesty9>	aoirthoir sounds like an X issue, if you try several different live cds you can find one that initializes your screen and check the xconf.
[negative]	[01:51]	<umop>	I have a directory with the permissions '?---------  ? ?      ?          ?        ? ' I can't change the permissions or delete the file, what can I do?
[negative]	[01:51]	<wondering>	Flannel: That might do the trick. I will let you know.
[negative]	[01:51]	<ajehuk>	"mike1 - actually I think it hits on the same problem every distro has - the various linux desktops are so configurable that you need to ship something (with any distro) that is a good starting point.  unfortuinaltey I dont think there is a good starting point that works for everyone.  The good thing about u/kbuntu is that the defaults are ""good enough"", saying that most other variations would also probably just be ""good enough"".  The b"
[positive]	[01:51]	<deepsa>	still i need to install 915resolution? still fiesty haven't solved this problem?
[negative]	[01:51]	<pppoe_dude>	umop, do that as root
[neutral]	[01:51]	<Mr_Giraffe>	deepsa, have you checked the forums?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<Mr_Giraffe>	i had a similar issue with my laptop before...
[negative]	[01:51]	<kev_b>	apparently i don't have enough disk space on /usr to upgrade to feisty... but i do! ideas?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<TaJMoX>	umop : fsck
[negative]	[01:51]	<umop>	pppoe_dude, Doesn't help.
[negative]	[01:51]	<VR_>	"has anyone burned any isos with ""Infra Recorder"" on windows? if so, how reliable is that?"
[negative]	[01:51]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, well that is reassuring.  Maybe I will try it... although, really, every bit of hardware is recognized, I have beryl running to my specs (which took FOREVER) and I'm pretty happy how things are going... maybe I won't mess with success
[neutral]	[01:51]	<Goldy>	umop, hcange the permission with CHMOD
[neutral]	[01:51]	<pppoe_dude>	deepsa, its not a feisty problem
[negative]	[01:51]	<ajehuk>	mike1 - of something so massivley flexible...
[negative]	[01:51]	<Cactii>	Anybody know if I can download the CD image and upgrade 6.10 from that???
[negative]	[01:51]	<chalcedony>	hey does anyone know where GAIM puts it's logs?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<umop>	Goldy, No.
[positive]	[01:51]	<livingdaylight>	Flannel, all non-free and proprietary mp3 flash etc is ready to go?
[negative]	[01:51]	<deepsa>	well i guess i need to hand edit the x conf file
[neutral]	[01:51]	<aoirthoir>	etplayer_fiesty9: i didnt know there were several live cds.
[negative]	[01:51]	<xq>	Is it in ~/.gaim/ ?
[negative]	[01:51]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, just how do you get the cube to stop and see two sides of it?
[negative]	[01:51]	<Goldy>	you are superuser yeah?
[negative]	[01:51]	<xq>	Just a guess, not sure.
[neutral]	[01:51]	<jrib>	chalcedony: ~/.gaim/logs/
[negative]	[01:52]	<umop>	TaJMoX, How do I do that?  I need to boot a live disc?
[negative]	[01:52]	<AnRkey>	Cactii, no you need to upgrade twice
[negative]	[01:52]	<Ltar>	where can I download the alternate CD? I don't see it anywhere on the ubntu site
[neutral]	[01:52]	<magnetron>	!alternate | Cactii
[negative]	[01:52]	<pppoe_dude>	deepsa, more of a video bios on the graphics adapter side problem
[positive]	[01:52]	<ubotu>	"Cactii: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an ""expert"" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a ""Live"" CD."
[negative]	[01:52]	<stefg>	Cactii: you can, but use a torrent please @HLINK
[positive]	[01:52]	<aoirthoir>	etplayer_fiesty9: i will wait until next week then have ubuntu support step me through it. Thats what I pay them for:)
[neutral]	[01:52]	<radge>	does anyone know why i am having this problem...when i shut down the splash screen is half way across the screen and over laps the right side and part of it appears on the left side of the screen
[negative]	[01:52]	<jrib>	Cactii: you can upgrade using the cd if you use the alternate cd only
[neutral]	[01:52]	<jrib>	!upgrade > Cactii    (Cactii, see the private message from ubotu)
[negative]	[01:52]	<etplayer_fiesty9>	aoirthoir I have tried livecds from other distros just to get the config right in ubuntu depending on hardware.
[positive]	[01:52]	<Flannel>	livingdaylight: @HLINK  see for yourself
[negative]	[01:52]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, sorry? What do you mean?  As in you want to move the cube so you see an edge and  the when you release the keys it stays?
[neutral]	[01:52]	<TaJMoX>	umop : sudo tune2fs -C 420
[neutral]	[01:52]	<TaJMoX>	umop : then reboot
[negative]	[01:52]	<voyvf>	anyone have any ideas why,  since upgrading to feisty, my wifi drops every so often? it's a very consistent thing, so i'm thinking it's related to the new network manager, but i'm not sure where to look.
[negative]	[01:52]	<AnRkey>	Cactii, sorry my mistake, not reading properly yes you can upgrade like that
[neutral]	[01:53]	<umop>	TaJMoX, Cheers.
[negative]	[01:53]	<TaJMoX>	umop : it will take a while to load because the splash screen will cover the details of the check
[neutral]	[01:53]	<TaJMoX>	but
[neutral]	[01:53]	<chalcedony>	ty jrib xq
[neutral]	[01:53]	<TaJMoX>	ya
[neutral]	[01:53]	<kneeki>	Anyone know if it's possible via Ubuntu to have an 'active desktop'. As in, using video files for your wallpaper image?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Mr_Giraffe>	voyvf, iwconfig and ifconfig don't do anything?
[positive]	[01:53]	<Tell>	Wow, ubuntu detected my network card straight away and automatically started working through it, no configuration needed, straight online...thats pretty amazing. Will this change when I go to make the permainstall :P
[positive]	[01:53]	<ReSPiDeR>	who was helping me with grub and lilo?
[positive]	[01:53]	<livingdaylight>	Flannel, cheers.... looks like Feisty is very different then
[neutral]	[01:53]	<radge>	anyone?
[positive]	[01:53]	<aoirthoir>	etplayer_fiesty9: ah ok I gotcha. Yeah it worked with dapper and edgy. So ima just wait:)
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Mr_Giraffe>	Tell, it should work automatically on a permanent install too
[positive]	[01:53]	<umop>	TaJMoX, Okay, I'll be back if I still have problems ;)
[negative]	[01:53]	<duelboot>	"SubMOA, when I change desktops it simply moves to the second one...I've seen it where people stop the cube in the middle and you can ""in essence"" see both desktops...is that clear?"
[neutral]	[01:53]	<voyvf>	Mr_Giraffe: they do,  in fact i scripted them because of how common my connection drops.
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jrib>	kneeki: mplayer can play videos on the root window
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Ltar>	I need a torrent or download link for the alternate CD
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Tell>	awesome. So I open up the install on the desktop, and it'll format the drives for me too?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<magnetron>	!torrents
[positive]	[01:54]	<ubotu>	Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: @HLINK
[negative]	[01:54]	<TaJMoX>	kneeki : there is a x root display...nautilus usually sits there
[negative]	[01:54]	<voyvf>	but my wifi device drops about every 20 min or so.
[neutral]	[01:54]	<radge>	does anyone know why i am having this problem...when i shut down the splash screen is half way across the screen and over laps the right side and part of it appears on the left side of the screen
[negative]	[01:54]	<kneeki>	TaJMoX: Hmm. x root display, I've never  heard of this.
[negative]	[01:54]	<Mr_Giraffe>	voyf, this is just a guess, but maybe it's trying to refresh the connection and can't quite make it?
[positive]	[01:54]	<duelboot>	voyvf, has it dropped for a while?
[positive]	[01:54]	<Mr_Giraffe>	voyvf, what make is your router?
[positive]	[01:54]	<voyvf>	duelboot: it dropped while i was asking this question :D
[negative]	[01:54]	<CapaH>	Hi all, question -- why does CTRL+F8 not switch to another session?
[negative]	[01:54]	<duelboot>	voyvf, you may need to change your channel to avoid interference
[neutral]	[01:54]	<mrpoundsign>	can I mount BSD formatted partitions in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<voyvf>	linksys
[negative]	[01:54]	<xq>	Or what's the chipset on the card?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<TaJMoX>	kneeki er its called root window
[negative]	[01:55]	<Mr_Giraffe>	voyf, is it a WRT54G?
[neutral]	[01:55]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, any answer?
[neutral]	[01:55]	<xq>	mrpoundsign, aye
[negative]	[01:55]	<ajehuk>	Mr_Giraffe - voyf - just thinking about powersaving etc.. is the card in use in that period or is it a drop due to inactivity?
[neutral]	[01:55]	<voyvf>	chipset is rt2500, router is wrt54g
[neutral]	[01:55]	<stefg>	radge: seems that the driver is adressing more menory than you have in your graphics card
[negative]	[01:55]	<kneeki>	TaJMoX: Hmm, does it function like the windows version 'Dream Scene'?
[negative]	[01:55]	<CapaH>	When I ctrl+f8 instead of seeing a new session I see a bunch of white on black text with [failed]  at the bottom --- apparently the tail of some log file from who knows when
[neutral]	[01:55]	<voyvf>	but this didn't happen until after the upgrade to feisty, likely along with the kernel update.
[negative]	[01:55]	<stefg>	radge: or a sync problem of your monitor
[negative]	[01:55]	<mrpoundsign>	xq: cool, any special packages needed?  I am going to try and put this disk in a USB case to load some data off it.
[neutral]	[01:55]	<duelboot>	voyvf, what I meant was...has it been doing this  a while or just recently?
[neutral]	[01:55]	<voyvf>	just since upgrading to feisty
[positive]	[01:55]	<Mr_Giraffe>	duelboot, he said since he upgraded
[neutral]	[01:56]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, I send you a message
[neutral]	[01:56]	<duelboot>	Mr_Giraffe, sorry had missed the first part which is why I asked
[negative]	[01:56]	<Mr_Giraffe>	oh, i wasn't saying that in a mean way
[positive]	[01:56]	<voyvf>	i was an early feisty adopter, but i'm updated completely now :D
[negative]	[01:56]	<Mr_Giraffe>	sorry bout that
[neutral]	[01:56]	<duelboot>	np
[neutral]	[01:56]	<duelboot>	same here
[neutral]	[01:56]	<TaJMoX>	kneeki : i think xv can play on the root window
[neutral]	[01:56]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, did you get it?
[positive]	[01:56]	<livingdaylight>	Flannel, is Feisty awesome?
[negative]	[01:56]	<kneeki>	TaJMoX: Hmm, thanks!
[neutral]	[01:56]	<TaJMoX>	kneeki : xv -root
[negative]	[01:56]	<chemisus>	anyone know where to find the md5sum value for fiesty iso?
[negative]	[01:56]	<Mr_Giraffe>	anyway, voyf + duelboot, i used to have that problem with my wrt54g, try changing/upgrading the firmware
[neutral]	[01:56]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, no...lemme register...hold on
[negative]	[01:56]	<breakthru>	how do i configure the processor speed?
[positive]	[01:57]	<jrib>	chemisus: there is an MD5SUMS file on all the mirrors
[negative]	[01:57]	<SubMOA>	ohh, ok.
[positive]	[01:57]	<atoponce>	chemisus: check the mirrors
[neutral]	[01:57]	<chemisus>	ok, thanks
[positive]	[01:57]	<radge>	what would i do to fix it? its not so much of a problem just an annoyance
[negative]	[01:57]	<voyvf>	Mr_Giraffe: i'll try that as a last resort. i hate to admit it, but i hadn't thought of changing the channel

[positive]	[01:57]	<Mr_Giraffe>	voyf, try that too :P
[negative]	[01:57]	<duelboot>	voyvf, it probably won't matter as that would only work if a router nearby is causing interference
[neutral]	[01:58]	<duelboot>	voyvf, shouldn't be related to the upgrade

[negative]	[01:59]	<ajehuk>	Mr_Giraffe voyvf dualboot - if its a wrt box looking at dd-wrt is a god idea anyway... although I cant see why the router would cause the drop if it is only happening 'after' an upgrade.. - I still suggest it may be a powersave on idle issue that has recently been implemented for the driver - there are a few other people reporting periods of inactivity leading to connection drops...

[negative]	[02:30]	<Enron>	I can't send mails, using mail command and nothing is showing up in mail.log
[negative]	[02:30]	<jrib>	Malachi: is it listed first in your sources.list?
[negative]	[02:30]	<steve_>	ok theres definitely something wrong with my graphics drivers or something :(
[negative]	[02:30]	<[acid] Neatchee>	AnRkey: PM me.  I use xchat
[neutral]	[02:30]	<ffm>	HOW CAN I make my computer execute a command ON BOOT in a TERMINAL as ME?
[negative]	[02:30]	<Malachi>	Let me check, I did the software sources.
[negative]	[02:30]	<ringo11_>	that should probably work
[negative]	[02:30]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, no worries...just do it here...BTW here's another site...@HLINK  although it's not responding at the moment
[neutral]	[02:30]	<magnetron>	AnRkey, it is already there (to the right)
[neutral]	[02:30]	<faksor>	hi all
[neutral]	[02:30]	<Hairulfr>	Night all
[negative]	[02:31]	<Mr_Giraffe>	magnetron, he might want a list list
[neutral]	[02:31]	<iamelite>	<ringo11_> Thank you mate. I do appreciate that. Lets assume i did that.
[neutral]	[02:31]	<faksor>	congrats on feisty release!
[negative]	[02:31]	<jrib>	Malachi: hmm, actually I am reading the instructions now.  It should ask you to install from the cd when you pop it in
[positive]	[02:31]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, go to a command line and type the following...
[negative]	[02:31]	<Mr_Giraffe>	like a textfile

[negative]	[02:31]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, ok
[positive]	[02:31]	<bimberi>	ep2011: going by that, both install and upgrading have issues.  This is always likely given the myriad of hardware and configurations possible.  The installer has been tested and has worked for many.
[negative]	[02:31]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, btw, did you check out the link?
[neutral]	[02:31]	<iamelite>	<ringo11_> lets say, it diddnt work.
[negative]	[02:31]	<steve_>	i have a 5 button mouse and only 3 buttons were detected.  is there a way to redetect the buttons?
[negative]	[02:31]	<jrib>	"Malachi: and if it doesn't do so, you are supposed to run: gksu ""sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"" .  I'm reading: @HLINK"
[neutral]	[02:31]	<tuxedo_kamen>	misfit-toy, I have a download limit >_>
[negative]	[02:31]	<duelboot>	which on SubMOA sorry
[neutral]	[02:32]	<Malachi>	jrib: It doesn't, and I do run that command.
[positive]	[02:32]	<Malachi>	jrib: It seems that it does begin to install from the CD, but just connects to the internet and downloads files.
[neutral]	[02:32]	<iamelite>	im going to res-tard into my install now. Ill see you soon
[negative]	[02:32]	<richdurhm>	hey guys im getting a bunch of errors when upgrading
[neutral]	[02:32]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, @HLINK
[negative]	[02:32]	<bsnider>	anybody know how to set up an nfs share when the directory name has two words?
[negative]	[02:32]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, thats what I'm trying to get
[neutral]	[02:32]	<ringo11_>	Oh I also removed several modules from xorg.conf like dri and a few others that i cant remember, jus trial and error
[neutral]	[02:32]	<Malachi>	jrib: The CD drive _did_ spin at the beginning, though.
[negative]	[02:32]	<jrib>	Malachi: are you sure it isn't grabbing uploads for packages that you installed outside of main?

[negative]	[02:35]	<jrib>	Malachi: hmm if it is only downloading things, it may not matter if you stop it.  But I am not familiar with what the gui does when it starts upgrading so I can't tell you for sure
[neutral]	[02:35]	<ryeth>	anybody know why my speakers don't play as loud through ubuntu as they do through windows?

[neutral]	[02:37]	<duelboot>	Sterk, WPA working?  Need assistance?
[negative]	[02:37]	<magnetron>	Mudoch: you basically have 2 options: of your router is a DNS server: add the ubuntu box manually. if it isn't, then add it to the HOSTS file in Windows
[negative]	[02:38]	<jasin>	I keep getting a failed with http;//archive.ubuntu.com feisty-security

[negative]	[02:43]	<ytsestef>	NET||abuse, the open drivers are installed out of the box in ubuntu feisty, right? so what do I need to get beryl work under xgl instead of aiglx?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<magnetron>	!codecs | TheIronChef
[positive]	[02:43]	<NET||abuse>	ytsestef, lotsa xorg.conf fiddling :)
[negative]	[02:44]	<Mudoch>	magnetron, would SAMBA provide the name resolution I seek?  For now I do use a static IP just thought there was a way to get into the DHCP client list on the router
[neutral]	[02:44]	<khatahn>	is there any text editor that is good in handling huge text files?
[negative]	[02:44]	<steve_>	ok.  only thing not working now is beryl
[negative]	[02:44]	<Pelo>	I guess we won'T have to bother installing  audio codecs either now with fiesty or is it just video ?

[neutral]	[02:44]	<NET||abuse>	ytsestef, I'd go through it a bit with ya now, but i gotta go sort out a faulty server just now.

[negative]	[02:44]	<neozen>	jasin: that's only on one server... and is slower the #@$#@$@#$@
[neutral]	[02:44]	<teoma29>	csmanx I do
[negative]	[02:44]	<ytsestef>	NET||abuse, only that? no packages to download?

[negative]	[02:44]	<jasin>	i'm already at 30% in the download
[positive]	[02:44]	<ryeth>	i thought the /list command shows list of channels??
[negative]	[02:44]	<jrib>	khatahn: something like sed would be best.  vim does a decent job if you turn off syntax highlighting

[neutral]	[02:44]	<andyrobo>	 when I am running berly I lose the option to send open windows to other workspaces in the drop down menu you get by right clicking on them, is this normal for feisty??
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Gnahhhh>	Frog29, what chipset?
[negative]	[02:44]	<ytsestef>	NET|abuse, ok don't worry. any wiki please???

[neutral]	[02:45]	<Pelo>	andyrobo,   ask in #beryl
[neutral]	[02:45]	<magnetron>	Mudoch, samba is handling netbios names, it wont help in your case.
[negative]	[02:45]	<jasin>	why would I want xubuntu? I have 2 gigs a ram and a 3ghz cpu
[negative]	[02:45]	<ResPiDeR>	what package should I install to get stdio.h stdlib.h etc? include files for C programming language
[positive]	[02:45]	<khatahn>	jrib: i was afraid the answer would be sed ;)
[negative]	[02:45]	<jikanter>	Frog29: I was wondering the same thing, I think it has something to do with the amount of traffic on the site
[neutral]	[02:45]	<Frog29>	Gnahhhh broadcom
[positive]	[02:45]	<NET||abuse>	ytsestef, there's prolly just somat in there that's not done right for your setup ;)

[negative]	[02:45]	<khatahn>	jrib: ah, i tried vim but it choked on the file, but i'll have to try disabling highlighting then
[neutral]	[02:45]	<Pelo>	csmanx,  you need to either reinstall grub from the live cd or add windows to the grub menu
[negative]	[02:45]	<magnetron>	Mudoch, This seems more like a problem of configuring the windows box
[negative]	[02:45]	<jijutm>	hi all.. I am real newbie to ubuntu
[neutral]	[02:45]	<jrib>	khatahn: how big?
[negative]	[02:45]	<dboy>	hey guys just new to ubuntu thought I'd pop in and see what I can learn

[negative]	[02:46]	<dave__>	so i open update manager, click upgrade, and it just sits there
[positive]	[02:46]	<steve_>	do people recommend installing automatix2?
[negative]	[02:46]	<ytsestef>	any linux user is capable of coping with any distro. besides, ubuntu is a piece of cake
[positive]	[02:46]	<Tell>	ubuntu finished installing..Im really impressed ^^
[negative]	[02:46]	<dave__>	any ideas?
[neutral]	[02:46]	<Pelo>	jijutm,   condidering the amount of traffic in the channel today it would help if you made your statement /quesiton in one go
[negative]	[02:46]	<Mudoch>	Ok, right now I'm upgrading to 7.04, So far so...... Anyway the screen keeps going to sleep and I want it to stay on any quick hints what to change?
[negative]	[02:46]	<jamiehd>	I'm setting feisty downloading onto my laptop overnight, but I sleep in the same room. Is there any way to make the screen go black, but leave the update running?
[neutral]	[02:46]	<magnetron>	!final
[negative]	[02:46]	<ubotu>	If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[negative]	[02:47]	<TheoMurpse>	Wow, the servers really are taking a hit. Right now my upgrade says 14 hours left to finish the upgrade. :(

[positive]	[02:47]	<jijutm>	I am having 6.10 on my server and 7.04 on the desktops ( we made a switch from Win XP last week), and I need php 5.2.1 on the server..
[positive]	[02:47]	<TheIronChef>	whoever helped theironchef... thank you!
[neutral]	[02:47]	<Pelo>	Frog29,   do it from the alternate install cd
[negative]	[02:47]	<jasin>	kalikiana|d,  the live cd does not run from windows it runs off the cd. You boot off it during startup, ubuntu does not depend on any other os.
[neutral]	[02:47]	<matt__>	ryeth: have you ever tried out irssi, i like it a whole lot more that xchat
[neutral]	[02:47]	<TheoMurpse>	"Frog29 i think there is an ""alternate"" cd you can download"
[negative]	[02:47]	<duelboot>	Simply said...there is a safe mode to BFM that *should* be fine...but I'm no expert SubMOA
[negative]	[02:47]	<jrib>	Stormx2: try ; instead of && or just write a short script
[neutral]	[02:47]	<magnetron>	Frog29: you can order the CD through ShipIt
[negative]	[02:47]	<Frog29>	Pelo - will i have to reisntall or will it be an update?
[neutral]	[02:47]	<Pie-rate>	hey guys, i set up ubuntu for my mother on a 1920x1200 screen, the screen she's using now is 1280x1024. on the bootsplash, the monitor says OUT OF RANGE until its finished booting
[positive]	[02:47]	<Pie-rate>	how can i fix that so it shows the bootsplash?
[neutral]	[02:48]	<ryeth>	no i haven't.....what makes irssi better?
[negative]	[02:48]	<steve_>	so feisty is using totem to play my mp3s but don't most linux users or xmms or something like that?
[negative]	[02:48]	<garryFre>	Frog29 Oh, I hat 6.10 and lost that version when the upgrade to the new Ubuntu stalled and I had to restore and to my horror I thought I had backed up 6.10 but did not so I got to start all over from 6.6
[negative]	[02:48]	<steve_>	whats the app of choice?
[negative]	[02:48]	<Stormx2>	; didn't work either! bah!
[negative]	[02:48]	<jijutm>	but cant find any way to install php 5.2.1 with soap and SDO
[negative]	[02:48]	<ixian_>	hello i just mounted a fat32 partition in ubuntu, i can read/write all folders on it except the 'My Music'  folder, anyone know how i can fix that?
[neutral]	[02:48]	<matt__>	"ryeth: you open terminal to use it, within terminal, it is extremely lightweight, but sort of more ""geekish"" than xchat"
[positive]	[02:48]	<Pelo>	jijutm,   sudp apt-cache  search  keyword  ,find the package you need and  sudo apt-get install package name
[neutral]	[02:48]	<matt__>	ryeth: try this, sudo apt-get install irssi
[negative]	[02:48]	<kalikiana|d>	jasin, I am sorry. my question was unclear. I am logging in via samba.
[positive]	[02:48]	<GluE>	strange... the 7.04 i just d/led and burned today, wont work on my ubuntu box, but other cd's will.. and it works fine in windows ie. autorun.
[negative]	[02:48]	<ryeth>	"i don't care about the ""geekish"" part haha"
[negative]	[02:48]	<SubMOA>	duelboot, oOo, gotcha... maybe I'll make a junk folder and just play around theree :O)
[positive]	[02:48]	<Cabldevilk>	brb doing fresh install
[negative]	[02:49]	<ryeth>	okay, and then do i sudo apt-get remove xchat  ?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<duelboot>	SubMOA, now that's a great idea

[positive]	[02:49]	<Frog29>	so a revision of my question :) - can you UPDATE 6.10 using the altrenate cd? or can you just reisntall it?

[negative]	[02:52]	<matt__>	ryeth: isn't that so that you can access and write to ntfs partitions?
[positive]	[02:52]	<ryeth>	i'm still trying to learn ;)
[negative]	[02:52]	<kalikiana|d>	jasin, I know what samba is for. I want to copy some files from the pc running the live cd because of a broken hd.
[negative]	[02:52]	<slop>	anyone else in here having the BusyBox problem when booting the LiveCD?
[negative]	[02:52]	<jasin>	I only have 10 minutes left on the iso download. I can wait, whats 10 minutes.

[negative]	[02:52]	<wilo>	is there a problem with the Ubuntu software updates?

[negative]	[02:53]	<jijutm>	I was asking whether I could hire some expert ubuntuians to make me a preseed file
[neutral]	[02:53]	<jasin>	Mount the ntfs drive dont use samaba.

[negative]	[02:53]	<garryFre>	What gets me is that I'm back down to 6.06 from 6.10 because I for some gawd aweful reason I forgot to backup the Ubuntu. If stupidity were a crime I would be on death row!
[neutral]	[02:53]	<Frog29>	slop - my fix was checking my grub settings and pouring over them meticouously - thats all i know
[positive]	[02:54]	<Gnahhhh>	i need them to kick crazytom so i can log back in
[negative]	[02:54]	<jijutm>	ok pelo..
[negative]	[02:54]	<jrib>	Pharsalus: what errors do you get?
[negative]	[02:54]	<disasm>	kalikiana|d: so, you have a computer with a bad hd booting off a live cd and you need to get it to another computer, is that right?
[neutral]	[02:54]	<kde185>	does anyone know if Windows can run be run under KVM with Feisty?
[negative]	[02:54]	<izaak>	hi there, i've been using feisty since the first official beta.  about 2 weeks ago, network manager stopped detecting my wireless card, after i ran a bunch of updates - any idea?  dmesg is normal, and the interface appears in ifconfig.
[negative]	[02:54]	<Gnahhhh>	oh they already did thanks
[positive]	[02:54]	<Pelo>	Pharsalus,   use syanptic   menu > system > admin > synatpic package manager
[neutral]	[02:54]	<disasm>	kde185: anything can run with a kvm
[negative]	[02:54]	<Tell>	guys, uber noob question... I downloaded the nvidia ubuntu drivers, and the instructions say type run *program name* sh etc...where do I type that?
[negative]	[02:54]	<slop>	Frog29: i found one other person in the forums that suggested it was a problem with grub settings...unfortunately, i have never messed with grub settings...can you remember what you did to fix it?
[neutral]	[02:54]	<jrib>	!nvidia > Tell    (Tell, see the private message from ubotu)

[negative]	[02:55]	<disasm>	Tell: don't use the official nvidia drivers
[negative]	[02:55]	<kalikiana>	disasm: yes, I wanted to copy the files over with samba.
[negative]	[02:55]	<TheIronChef>	weird... when i try to get hte new codecs it jsut sits on 1/3 upgrades and doesnt dl...
[positive]	[02:55]	<disasm>	kde185: oh ;-)
[negative]	[02:55]	<PocketIRC>	<Frog29> worse wireless support in feisty..
[negative]	[02:55]	<Frog29>	slop - all i can say is when your in grub and choosing what to boot look at all of the settings and make sure it boots to the right partitions,etc.
[neutral]	[02:55]	<jrib>	locolbd: put a  .  in front of its name
[negative]	[02:55]	<disasm>	kde185: I think I've made that problem before

[positive]	[02:55]	<jijutm>	kde185: I just finished setting up xp in zen .. and it is cool
[neutral]	[02:55]	<Frog29>	slop - i think so....... i have it dual booting so i'm always in grub
[neutral]	[02:56]	<steve_>	test
[negative]	[02:56]	<Pelo>	Pharsalus,   you want adelpt then ,  don'T know where it is
[negative]	[02:56]	<disasm>	kalikiana: if smbfs is included on the live cd (I have no idea) you can mount a windows fs like so: mount //winpc/share /mnt   and then copy all over to /mnt
[negative]	[02:56]	<BHSPitMonkey>	ok, so I have a box here... it has no video output.  I'd like to be able to install *ubuntu and immediately ssh into it, is this easily doable?

[neutral]	[02:56]	<Pelo>	pipeline_,   try the alternate install cd
[neutral]	[02:56]	<Pelo>	pipeline_,  it's text based
[neutral]	[02:56]	<TheIronChef>	is a  wine already installed on feisty?

[neutral]	[02:57]	<jijutm>	yes..
[negative]	[02:57]	<pipeline_>	Pelo: okie... previous versions have worked, does that make any difference?
[negative]	[02:57]	<disasm>	kalikiana: if that doesn't work, get a live cd with a ssh server (@HLINK) start the ssh server and us something like winscp to login to the linux computer (running live cd) and get all the files that way
[neutral]	[02:57]	<mister_roboto>	pipeline_: do you get the text prompt with <ctl><alt><f1-f6>?
[neutral]	[02:57]	<jrib>	TheIronChef: it's in the repositories, but not installed by default

[negative]	[02:57]	<natham>	hi, is there any software to unpack the .msi files?
[negative]	[02:57]	<disasm>	mister_roboto: that's normal, that's how you get a virtual console
[negative]	[02:57]	<Pelo>	pipeline_,  might be a borked cd
[negative]	[02:57]	<Ionix>	it's so ridiculous... The ubuntu website is flooded. and navigating around the link is so SO slow~, unbelievable the torrent file is downloading at 0.1k/s
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Mudoch>	jijutm,  will VB run then?
[positive]	[02:57]	<jijutm>	kde185: It took around 15min to figure out.. and the normal install time

[negative]	[02:57]	<jijutm>	I did not check..
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Ashex>	like a dictionary search?
[positive]	[02:57]	<BHSPitMonkey>	TheIronChef, winehq also maintains their own deb repository, which you can add to your software sources, so that you always have the latest.
[negative]	[02:57]	<mister_roboto>	disasm: it would mean that the system fully booted but his X isn't working.  that is NOT normal

[negative]	[02:58]	<disasm>	oh, I thought you said he hit ctrl alt f1-f6 to get a terminal
[negative]	[02:58]	<stylus>	there is a language update (en) which doesn't seem to work? can i still install 7.04 without that particular update?
[neutral]	[02:58]	<TheIronChef>	YAY i finally got my mp3 codecs!

[negative]	[03:29]	<ShiFTKey>	does anyone know if there doing shipit with this version?
[neutral]	[03:30]	<IndyGunFreak>	ShiFTKey: lol, np.
[neutral]	[03:30]	<Ax4>	ubunt.com only giving me 300ish
[positive]	[03:30]	<NickGarvey>	pdusen: ifconfig, it will be the default gateway
[neutral]	[03:30]	<oth>	Pelo, why's that ?
[negative]	[03:30]	<oblib>	I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[negative]	[03:30]	<wastrel>	tbuss:  are you sure you're not seeing a cached version of the page after the 3rd password attempt?
[negative]	[03:30]	<magnetron>	darwin: this is a known bug. the fix is: 1. hit alt+f2  2. enter gconf-editor  3. change /apps/compiz/general/screen0/options hsize to 4
[negative]	[03:30]	<tbuss>	wastrel: I checked with HEAD and any even reloaded ff
[neutral]	[03:30]	<arejay>	anyone know how to change the time-out of sudo?
[neutral]	[03:30]	<delire>	oth: the demand is insanely high right now..
[positive]	[03:30]	<Pelo>	oth,  servers are overwhelmed what all the ppl who clicked the upgrade button
[negative]	[03:30]	<clop>	tristil, i understand that it's going to be buggier than 32-bit, but an application i need for my work literally does not run on 32-bit intel
[positive]	[03:31]	<TheDebugger>	ShiFTKey: Yes, already ordered mine :)
[negative]	[03:31]	<witless>	is it possible to CANCEL the upgrade?
[neutral]	[03:31]	<NickGarvey>	arejay: visudo
[negative]	[03:31]	<oth>	hmm
[positive]	[03:31]	<arejay>	NickGarvey, thank's :)
[positive]	[03:31]	<tristil>	clop, I wasn't telling you not to do, that's just what I got through Google. :)
[negative]	[03:31]	<tbuss>	wastrel: the funny thing is, the page will load after third attempt but loses all style sheet support that would otherwise be there
[positive]	[03:31]	<oth>	what upgrade button sudo update-manager -c ? :p
[positive]	[03:31]	<innerreflection>	Desperate nub in search of sound/wine expert. Need help getting multiple wine programs to play sound at the same time. (I've tried at least 3 guides,)
[positive]	[03:31]	<LabThug_hm>	"Pelo: is there any mirrors we can configure our ""upgrade buttons"" to use?"
[negative]	[03:31]	<Pelo>	witless,  yes if you are only at the downloading stage
[negative]	[03:31]	<pdusen>	NickGarvey: I'll return in a moment after I've tried that
[negative]	[03:31]	<Pelo>	oth,  same thing,  servers are too busy,  wait a few days
[positive]	[03:31]	<W|cked>	awesome
[negative]	[03:31]	<oth>	alright, I'll wait then
[negative]	[03:31]	<Pelo>	LabThug_hm,   wait a few days
[positive]	[03:31]	<delire>	arejay: you can set this in your sudoers file
[negative]	[03:31]	<ShiFTKey>	TheDebugger: thanks, I can download them, but it looks alot nicer to hand out the ship cds rather then my permenent marker ones
[neutral]	[03:32]	<downfallat111>	is the widescreen resolution prblem fixed in feisty, or will I have to use the 915resolution program?
[positive]	[03:32]	<HasratUSA>	witless it would be great for yourself if you don't cause although it's extremely slow right now, you will be downloading some files at an extremely slow rate. on the other hand, the more people gets frustrated, impatient and kills the upgrade, the more speed i get :)
[negative]	[03:32]	<delire>	witless: yes, as long as you are cancelling it during the download process.
[negative]	[03:32]	<LabThug_hm>	"Pelo: ""Don't care how, I want it now!!!!"""
[neutral]	[03:32]	<statictonic>	widescreen worked fine out of the box for me in feisty
[negative]	[03:32]	<LabThug_hm>	ever see the original Willy Wonka?
[neutral]	[03:32]	<Pelo>	LabThug_hm,  , oth  if you guys can't way get the torrent,   alternate install cd for upgrade live cd for a clean install
[positive]	[03:32]	<Ax4>	disasm, you wouldn't happen to have the full address path, so i can start downloading? :p
[neutral]	[03:32]	<tristil>	clop, does it use EFI maybe?
[negative]	[03:32]	<witless>	it's downloading now, but i'm downloading a torrent much faster
[positive]	[03:32]	<bayziders>	So how do you all like feisty? =)
[neutral]	[03:32]	<clop>	tristil, EFI?
[positive]	[03:32]	<magnetron>	innerreflection: you are using OSS, and OSS only supports one program at a time as default. is it Wow and Ventrilo? =D
[negative]	[03:32]	<oblib>	LVM Experts: I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[positive]	[03:32]	<tristil>	clop, anything unusual about the BIOS?
[positive]	[03:33]	<downfallat111>	does feisty support webcam
[neutral]	[03:33]	<disasm>	Ax4: deb @HLINK feisty main restricted
[negative]	[03:33]	<oth>	I can wait
[negative]	[03:33]	<Pelo>	LabThug_hm,  the original willy wonka gave me the creeps, those umpalumpas are freaksh
[negative]	[03:33]	<smo>	antone know if a variable for the created user in ubiquity install process is created ??? or howto know that...
[negative]	[03:33]	<clop>	not really, it's just a generic dell one
[positive]	[03:33]	<Ax4>	disasm, cool :)
[negative]	[03:33]	<HasratUSA>	delire oh really?
[positive]	[03:33]	<n3rdism>	I'm using a onboard intel chip for video, ubuntu has installed the default drivers perfectly. However I'm running the machine off my tv screen and require a smaller resolution then 1024x768. Everytime I change my resolution, using Edgy Eft, and make default; even when I don't make default, It will freeze up and take me back to login screen not saving the resolution settings.
[neutral]	[03:33]	<LabThug_hm>	hahahaha
[neutral]	[03:33]	<soulrider_>	does anyone know whent he next LTS release is comming ?
[neutral]	[03:33]	<witless>	i'm downloading the alternate install ISO
[negative]	[03:33]	<innerreflection>	magnetron: yep, how's you guess? umm, yea, I've read about OSS and Alsa, but none of the guides seem to work for me
[negative]	[03:33]	<clop>	it looks exactly like this guy's problem:
[neutral]	[03:33]	<clop>	@HLINK
[negative]	[03:33]	<NickGarvey>	soulrider_: I'd assume.. at least after the old one runs out.. so don't get too anxious
[negative]	[03:33]	<MrMakeveli>	i woudl like to resize my disk partitions in order to do the feisty upgrade. i cant find the app anywhere except when i install. where is it normally?
[neutral]	[03:33]	<ShiFTKey>	I ordered a solaris cd and it never came..
[negative]	[03:33]	<delire>	HasratUSA: yes, though only for the distribution upgrade itself.
[negative]	[03:33]	<ShiFTKey>	i hate sun
[positive]	[03:34]	<neozen>	well... dapper is good until 6/2009
[neutral]	[03:34]	<ShiFTKey>	ubuntu shipit > sun
[negative]	[03:34]	<neozen>	soulrider_: so my guess is then
[neutral]	[03:34]	<PresuntoRJ>	hey, on Feisty my VLC player keeps freezing and crashing the gdm back to the login screen... any ideas?
[negative]	[03:34]	<magnetron>	innerreflection: the wowwiki has a wine entry that adresses the problem, check that out?
[negative]	[03:34]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: yikes, that's no good. does it happen also with Totem?
[neutral]	[03:34]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, do you mean GParted? Try typing 'sudo gparted' from the command line
[negative]	[03:35]	<Pelo>	MrMakeveli,   gparted is not installed as default , but it is part of the live cd ,    if you want to resize a partition you are using now better do it from the live cd
[positive]	[03:35]	<Ax4>	im gonna throw my 2 x 100mbit boxes on the torrent to help out :)
[negative]	[03:35]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: toten seems ok, but I do prefer VLC
[neutral]	[03:35]	<rukuartic>	Ax4: :O
[negative]	[03:35]	<MrMakeveli>	oblib, pelo: i can just install it cant i?
[negative]	[03:35]	<innerreflection>	magnetron: yes, I've tried using alsa-oss but my mic doesn't work and the sound still can't be heard in both. dunno what I'm doing wrong
[neutral]	[03:35]	<Pelo>	MrMakeveli,  sudo apt-get install  gparted
[negative]	[03:35]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, yeah, but it makes more sense to just do it off the install cd
[negative]	[03:35]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: i understand.. perhaps it's a problem with the VLC package on Feisty? where did you aquire it from?
[negative]	[03:36]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: what is even odder, apport wont even notice the crash.
[negative]	[03:36]	<pdusen>	NickGarvey: I tried to ping my router and it told me the network was unreachable.
[negative]	[03:36]	<disasm>	Ax4: did you just slow me down?
[neutral]	[03:36]	<Pelo>	MrMakeveli,   get ready for a long install, the servers are loaded right now
[negative]	[03:36]	<[acid] Neatchee>	I know the repos are slow, but are some of them down right now?  I can't seem to get cpufrequtils to download :O
[negative]	[03:36]	<a514>	Desktop Effects Cube worked for a sec but not now?
[positive]	[03:36]	<Mudoch>	good nite all, thanks for the help and answers
[neutral]	[03:36]	<Ax4>	disasm, no lol
[negative]	[03:36]	<fulat2k>	hi folks, i've been using feisty beta.  but i'm not getting any Upgrade button in both update manager and adept (using kubuntu).  I'm pointing my sources to Taiwan.  COuld that be the problem?
[negative]	[03:36]	<NickGarvey>	"pdusen: could you pastebin ""ifconfig"" please?"
[negative]	[03:36]	<arejay>	delire, timestamp_timeout seems to be the way do i set this under Defaults?
[positive]	[03:36]	<magnetron>	innerreflection: Ventrilo has an issue with loosing focus, appdb.winehq.org has some writeup about it
[neutral]	[03:36]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: add/remove (the same from aptitude or apt-get)
[negative]	[03:36]	<rukuartic>	fulat2k: Possibly, have you tried it without?
[neutral]	[03:36]	<[acid] Neatchee>	!final | fulat2k
[negative]	[03:36]	<ubotu>	fulat2k: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[neutral]	[03:36]	<delire>	arejay: yes, from memory that sounds right
[negative]	[03:36]	<Ax4>	disasm, i swear, im still getting the release from the mirror i was using b4
[neutral]	[03:36]	<pdusen>	NicKGarvey: From windows?
[positive]	[03:36]	<disasm>	Ax4: just giving you a hard time, it dropped down to 100k for a bit, it's almost done though
[negative]	[03:37]	<Oatmeat>	how do I find out my IP in linux?
[negative]	[03:37]	<MrMakeveli>	oblib, the problem is that i need to partition it and move my files onto the new parition im creating before i install. if i do it from the live cd i can only add delete or modify them. not move shit around right?
[negative]	[03:37]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: right, ok. which architecture?
[neutral]	[03:37]	<Ax4>	ifconfig -a
[positive]	[03:37]	<disasm>	Ax4: back up to 700 k ;-)
[neutral]	[03:37]	<delire>	Oatmeat: /sbin/ifconfig
[negative]	[03:37]	<aoliax>	hello all, my update to 7.04 just stopped around 811/1115 fetching files, is the server overloaded with requests or something, i should i try another method?
[positive]	[03:37]	<Oatmeat>	thanks
[neutral]	[03:37]	<rukuartic>	"Oatmeat: From a terminal, type ""ifconfig -a"""
[positive]	[03:37]	<eternaljoy>	does the Ubuntu 7.04 LiveCD support installing Ubuntu to a 2nd hardrive?  It wont automatically install Grub on my 1st partitoon will it?
[positive]	[03:37]	<fulat2k>	[acid] Neatchee: in that case i'm on the final then. thanks :P
[negative]	[03:37]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: it got to be related to a later upgrade on the beta, cause it used to work on early betas... not sure exactaly what the version I had a couple of weeks ago
[negative]	[03:37]	<Ax4>	don't you love EASY questions?
[neutral]	[03:37]	<Ax4>	lol
[positive]	[03:37]	<rukuartic>	aoliax: Probably overloaded, or it hit a big package :)
[negative]	[03:37]	<NickGarvey>	pdusen: yeah, like run ifconfig and put it on a usb drive or something if you can
[neutral]	[03:37]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: i386 (Compaq Armada M700 laptop)
[negative]	[03:37]	<LabThug_hm>	hmmm, after the update tool is downloaded, what's supposed to happen next?  The download window disappeared, but nothing is happening.
[positive]	[03:37]	<[acid] Neatchee>	fulat2k: I literally just asked that question when I came in here, so glad to pass on the info :)
[neutral]	[03:37]	<rukuartic>	aoliax: Do you see your router lights blinking?
[negative]	[03:37]	<Pie-rat2>	bootsplash is supposed to look like @HLINK instead, with vga=795 it looks like @HLINK and with vga=792 it looks like @HLINK
[negative]	[03:37]	<Pie-rat2>	with no vga= option it looks like a box that says OUT OF RANGE in the middle.
[negative]	[03:37]	<Pie-rat2>	how can i fix this?
[negative]	[03:37]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, but if you install on the new partition won't it overwrite the files you just copied to it? Or do you want to make a new one, copy old files to that, and then install on your old partition?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<fami>	!.chm > fami
[negative]	[03:38]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: sounds like a bug in VLC to me, perhaps a memory leak or similar. if i were you i'd register a bug.
[neutral]	[03:38]	<HasratUSA>	okay here is a question: has anyone successfully upgraded from Edgy to Feisty via online? is there any success rate?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<aoliax>	rukuartic, yes
[neutral]	[03:38]	<fami>	!chm > fami
[neutral]	[03:38]	<aoliax>	rukuartic, light are blinking
[neutral]	[03:38]	<eternaljoy>	HasratUSA: no
[negative]	[03:38]	<a514>	Help, the Desktop Effect Cube is not working for me?!
[negative]	[03:38]	<oblib>	LVM Experts: I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[positive]	[03:38]	<rukuartic>	aoliax: Then you're still downloading. :)
[negative]	[03:38]	<fami>	ah
[negative]	[03:38]	<rukuartic>	aoliax: Its just a big package.
[neutral]	[03:38]	<pdusen>	NickGarvey: Can't I just C&P the results of ipconfig in here?
[negative]	[03:38]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: if only apport set the response according to the issue, it would be realy helpful
[neutral]	[03:38]	<delire>	Pie-rat2: from memory you have a range from 1-9 with the vga option.
[negative]	[03:38]	<innerreflection>	magnetron: losing focus would cause my mic not to work?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<fami>	what need to read .chm file?
[negative]	[03:38]	<aoliax>	rukuartic, this fetching seems to be taking an insaely long time, should i have waited until tomorrow to update?
[negative]	[03:38]	<NickGarvey>	pdusen: no I want to see data from the linux box.. if you can..
[positive]	[03:39]	<fulat2k>	[acid] Neatchee: cool :)  d/lding final release now.  gonna install on my desktop when i get back... yum, yum :)
[neutral]	[03:39]	<jrib>	fami: xchm or gnochm
[negative]	[03:39]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: what kind of attachements would you recomend? lspci -vv? /var/daemon.log? dmesg?
[negative]	[03:39]	<rukuartic>	aoliax: Can you leave your computer on overnight?
[negative]	[03:39]	<sthompson>	Hi all, can someone point me to some good documentation or first hand knowledge on how to become a mirror for Ubuntu?
[positive]	[03:39]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: yes, this is very odd.. it seems the crash is happening before hand, sudden-death style
[negative]	[03:39]	<aoliax>	rukuartic, good suggestion, i guess i shall do that
[neutral]	[03:39]	<Pie-rat2>	delire: no, look it up on the internet. 792 is 1024x768 at 24 bit color, 795 is 1280x1024 at 24 bit color
[neutral]	[03:39]	<magnetron>	innerreflection: yeah, it makes the PTT key not working, read more at appdb.winehq.org
[positive]	[03:39]	<[acid] Neatchee>	fulat2k: now I just wish the repos would speed up so I can install some extras :O
[positive]	[03:39]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: dmesg and ~/.xsession-errors and also a gdm log file if found.
[negative]	[03:39]	<Pelo>	sthompson,   check the how to participate section on www.ubuntu.com,  might be how to contribute
[negative]	[03:39]	<HasratUSA>	eternal okay so i take it noone has finished the upgrade via online yet. the lucky ones have either burnt it and did the 'distribution upgrade only' or simply reinstalled from scratch
[neutral]	[03:39]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: as soon as I press PLAY with any video format (Ubuntu codecs) WMV, AVI, MPG...
[negative]	[03:39]	<MrMakeveli>	oblib, this is what im doing: i already have seperate partitions for /boot, /home, /var, /swap and /.  i also want to format them all again just to start fresh fresh. my /home is 120 gib but im using like 10 of it. so i want to resize my /home to make room for a new partition where i will store the files i want to keep, and format all the others. and then install again put the files back and resize the /home back to normal. make sense?
[positive]	[03:39]	<magnetron>	innerreflection: actually appdb is the best place for wine info
[neutral]	[03:39]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: also detail the file you're attempting to play and your architecture.
[neutral]	[03:40]	<fulat2k>	[acid] Neatchee: what kinda extras?
[negative]	[03:40]	<pdusen>	NickGarvey: Not unless I write it down or something, I'm literally dual-booting here. And I'm trying to do this all command line because my video drivers aren't working at the moment, so I'm not sure how I would manage to get it onto a USB drive.
[negative]	[03:40]	<delire>	PresuntoRJ: sounds like a serious enough problem to warrant a very useful bug report..
[negative]	[03:40]	<tristil>	clop, wait is it a clean install?
[positive]	[03:40]	<PresuntoRJ>	delire: I'll look into it asap and post yet another issue on lauchpad ;)

[negative]	[03:41]	<tristil>	clop, Yeah, I'm thinking about that. Because I saw this:
[positive]	[03:41]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: you might look into LVM.  Which allows you to resize partitions on the fly

[negative]	[03:42]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, seems like it would make more sense just to keep the /home partition and delete the files you don't want. I generally try to avoid resizing/moving partitions in case something goes wrong. What you are planning should work fine, but in any case, I hope you have a backup of important stuff in case it blows up...
[neutral]	[03:42]	<david__>	ok, thanks

[positive]	[03:44]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: Gparted is a program to format stuff.  LVM is a system of partitioning that allows you to shift stuff around later.
[neutral]	[03:44]	<bambie>	when you log on to ubuntu
[negative]	[03:44]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, yes, that is usually why you want to keep your /home. If you want to kill all your settings, then delete the .program_names (.mozilla for example) directories.

[negative]	[03:46]	<delire>	tristil: right, i'm not a big fan of OS X but i notice a few friends have asked about installing Ubuntu on their macbooks.
[positive]	[03:46]	<LabThug_hm>	aragirn: thanks!
[positive]	[03:46]	<foug>	what is the command to install opera through terminal?
[negative]	[03:46]	<IncredibleHink>	Whats the difference in /usr/username /home/username  /lib /bin..... i want to install a program but only make it available to my username....... i also want to install a program and install it for all usernames..... how does that work?
[negative]	[03:46]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: obviously, all the compiling and stuff on that page doesn't apply to ubuntu.  But the opening paragraphs explain LVM really well
[negative]	[03:46]	<a514>	Yeah so the Sound Recorder seems to record but when it does not playback? yeah and alsa is working
[neutral]	[03:46]	<MrMakeveli>	Flannel, what other differences are there for the alternate vs normal?
[negative]	[03:46]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, do you have enough space to copy the files you want to save to one of your existing partitions? If so, copy them over (so to /var/home or something), erase everything in your /home partition, and then copy it back.
[positive]	[03:47]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, LVM is cool but fairly complicated
[positive]	[03:47]	<jrib>	fami: that page is timing out here, can you use @HLINK ?
[neutral]	[03:47]	<Pelo>	foug,  probably sudo apt-get opera
[negative]	[03:47]	<magnetron>	"foug: use ""add/ remove programs"", no need for terminal"
[neutral]	[03:47]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: Alternate is a textmode installer, instead of a lvieCD.  You boot up, and go straiht to the installer.  Alternate also has additional options (a GUI-less install, OEM install, etc)
[negative]	[03:47]	<foug>	Pelo: nope didn't work, that's what i tried

[positive]	[03:48]	<delire>	tristil: yep, gotcha ;)

[neutral]	[03:48]	<MrMakeveli>	oblib, you are saying to move it there, format others, install while leaving /var the same. and then moving back after install?
[neutral]	[03:48]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: oh, Aternate CD also has a repository on it.  So you get full ubntu install + additional packages without the internet.
[negative]	[03:48]	<magnetron>	foug: if you are up for a challenge, start with man apt-get and work your way from there
[negative]	[03:48]	<oblib>	MrMakeveli, you can do what you were planning originally, probably without any problems. It's just a general rule to back up before messing around with partitions
[neutral]	[03:48]	<delire>	hehe
[neutral]	[03:48]	<MrMakeveli>	Flannel, cd or dvd?
[neutral]	[03:48]	<fami>	jrib: yes, @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:48]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: CD
[negative]	[03:48]	<pdusen>	NickGarvey: I can reboot if I really have too. It's just a hassle. I really want to get my network adapter working properly, though.
[positive]	[03:48]	<aragirn>	thanks delire
[negative]	[03:49]	<hagabaka>	oh no
[negative]	[03:49]	<MrMakeveli>	oblib, the problem is that this kind of IS my back up. haha

[neutral]	[03:49]	<bambie>	bleh
[negative]	[03:49]	<rukuartic>	Hey, if I reboot in the middle of a distro upgrade using the package manager, does it bork?
[neutral]	[03:49]	<bambie>	i just restarted and it did work
[positive]	[03:49]	<magnetron>	foug: it is the manual
[neutral]	[03:49]	<rukuartic>	bambie: Heh
[negative]	[03:49]	<oblib>	Flannel: Do you know LVM well?  I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[negative]	[03:49]	<hagabaka>	i'm actually getting segmentation fault when running aptitude, or apt-get :(
[negative]	[03:49]	<MrMakeveli>	Flannel, why would anyone do the normal over the alternate then?
[neutral]	[03:49]	<rukuartic>	bambie: sometimes its just weird little problems
[neutral]	[03:49]	<fami>	jrib: yes, @HLINK this's my sources.list
[negative]	[03:49]	<Pelo>	rukuartic,   if you are in the middle of the download,  you can stop it before rebooting
[negative]	[03:49]	<bambie>	yeah
[negative]	[03:49]	<rukuartic>	bambie: How is it? I'm still updating :(
[neutral]	[03:49]	<Flannel>	oblib: Setup your LVM in the installer
[negative]	[03:49]	<rukuartic>	Pelo: There's no cancel button
[neutral]	[03:49]	<bambie>	i've 6.06
[neutral]	[03:49]	<bambie>	and my wireless doesn't works
[negative]	[03:49]	<Flannel>	MrMakeveli: because some people like the liveCD aspect, and the pretty GUI installer.
[negative]	[03:49]	<HasratUSA>	why would you need to reboot in the middle of a distro upgrade?
[neutral]	[03:50]	<NickGarvey>	pdusen: is there another computer you have by any chance?
[negative]	[03:50]	<jrib>	IncredibleHink: one way to do it would be to install azureus using Synaptic or Add/Remove and then changing the permissions on the binary
[negative]	[03:50]	<rukuartic>	HasratUSA: Thats not the question though.
[neutral]	[03:50]	<Josesordo>	=( error in upgrade
[negative]	[03:50]	<something_else>	people, just installed feisty, but it strangely falls to busybox
[negative]	[03:50]	<oblib>	Flannel, its not one of my main partitions, just a mythtv data partition. Will the installer just prompt to restore it or something?
[positive]	[03:50]	<rukuartic>	HasratUSA: Lets say the power borks on me.
[negative]	[03:50]	<Flannel>	oblib: oh, you have additional LVM drives?  No.  Just add them to fstab
[positive]	[03:50]	<bayziders>	Yes I am geting decent upgrade speeds =DD
[negative]	[03:50]	<NickGarvey>	pdusen: honestly, I can't guarentee you 100% attention all the time, so if you reboot, get all this info, and then I take off, I'd just be wasting your time

[negative]	[03:50]	<toxickiwi>	Anyone know how long an upgrade from the alt CD should take?  Mine has been going for 3 hours so far.
[positive]	[03:50]	<Flannel>	oblib: It should see it.  When you're mounting partitions, you should be able to add it

[negative]	[04:58]	<whonicca>	in feisty, is it just me when changing wall papers where u get the option to tile, fill, zoom or stretch, scale the wallpaper, no matter what u choose it stays filled i think, is anyone else having this bug?
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Tonren>	Abom: I dunno what turning off color management reallyd oes, though. I hope it doesn't break something else down the road
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Frog29>	is there any way to find out what kernel version i have by viewing the file system through windows with the ubuntu drive mounted?

[negative]	[04:58]	<wobx>	DARKGuy: but you have to decide rather early..when you didn't already put much effort in your system..because afaik there's no way to dist-upgrade from i386 to *64 vice versa

[negative]	[05:01]	<Frog29>	would the ubuntu update have updatd GRUB or added an entry if one was dual booting and had a seperate boot partition?
[neutral]	[05:01]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, type 'sudo network-admin' in a terminal
[neutral]	[05:02]	<joejaxx>	vafada: Desktop is livecd based; alternative is a text installer

[negative]	[05:02]	<bimberi>	kondor101: I hope that's not the reason.  Anyway I've asked via a comment on that bug
[positive]	[05:02]	<Wiseguy>	is anyone else having troubles reloading package information in synaptic?
[negative]	[05:02]	<Pelo>	Frog29,  yes it would edit grub since you would have a  new  kernel in there

[positive]	[05:02]	<vafada>	joejaxx,  thanks
[negative]	[05:02]	<rellik_>	if I want to upgrade to the latest stable release of ubuntu, is it 'apt-get install dist-upgrade'?  do I have to change the lines in my sources.list that all say 'dapper' ?

[neutral]	[05:02]	<Frog29>	Pelo - would it add a new entry or just edit it? becasue i still only have one ubuntu entry (and a recovery)
[neutral]	[05:03]	<ricardo>	brasil?
[neutral]	[05:03]	<RAOF>	rellik_: No!  *Don't* do that, you'll almost certainly break something.
[neutral]	[05:03]	<dc>	where can i find the torrent?
[neutral]	[05:03]	<pppoe_dude>	rellik_, update-manager should automatically tell you of a new version
[negative]	[05:03]	<llol>	i mean MAKE them bigger
[negative]	[05:03]	<stiv2k>	why is X saying it cant find the nvidia kernel module when i have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic installed

[neutral]	[05:03]	<ubotu>	rellik_: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[negative]	[05:03]	<PresuntoRJ>	CodingZen: since the files are released to the original repository and THEN copied to the mirrors, it might take a few minutes for the upgrades to spread to the other countries... but usually not more than 30 min or so
[neutral]	[05:03]	<RAOF>	rellik_: Note that you *have* to upgrade through Edgy.
[negative]	[05:03]	<wobx>	i wonder if an upgrade from edgy to feisty is as easy as to put feisty repos into /etc/apt/sources.list and do a apt-get dist-upgrade? or is there anything else to consider?
[neutral]	[05:03]	<kofwang>	 Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!! when i try to boot
[negative]	[05:03]	<josesordo-->	Failed to fetch @HLINK Unable to find expected entry  deb-src/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?) --> Why????
[positive]	[05:03]	<Pelo>	Frog29,   it would probabaly also remvoe the older entries since those kernels would not apply to the new version

[neutral]	[05:03]	<kondor101>	bimberi, good comment
[negative]	[05:03]	<dc>	where can i find the fiesty torrent. and do i need to burn a cd do install it?
[negative]	[05:03]	<llol>	how do i make the window maximize and close buttons BIGGER?
[neutral]	[05:03]	<RAOF>	josesordo--: Because you've still got a beryl repository in your sources.list.

[positive]	[05:04]	<Pelo>	Frog29,  in all likelyhood it probably made a new grub menu altogether
[negative]	[05:04]	<zntneo>	is there any reason why i can't log into ubuntu?
[negative]	[05:04]	<gr3ml1n>	can anyone tell me why entering a static ip in the gnome network manager makes my connection not work anymore but dhcp does?
[negative]	[05:04]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: there's some problem with not having a password with wireless connections :(
[neutral]	[05:04]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, what wireless card do you have?
[positive]	[05:04]	<RAOF>	"rellik_: Yes.  Basically, you just have to run ""update-manager"" twice :)"

[neutral]	[05:04]	<llol>	i got beryl on
[negative]	[05:04]	<Pelo>	llol,   you can probably change the size of the title bar in gconf-editor somewhere  the button size might follow
[neutral]	[05:04]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom,  is it recognised by ubuntu?
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: yes
[neutral]	[05:05]	<llol>	i see
[negative]	[05:05]	<gr3ml1n>	can anyone tell me why entering a static ip in the gnome network manager makes my connection not work anymore but dhcp does?
[negative]	[05:05]	<Pelo>	Frog29,  that would be my guess,   but it might have been backup
[neutral]	[05:05]	<pppoe_dude>	"Abom, does ""iwlist scanning"" yield anything?"
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Frog29>	Does anyone know the ner version of the kernel for ubuntu in 7.04?
[negative]	[05:05]	<vafada>	"i'm getting ""can't access tty; Job control turned off"" when booting LiveCD :(  i have ubuntu ultimate edition right now so i had no problems with previous ubuntu"
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: yes it does, I can see my router just fine
[negative]	[05:05]	<whonicca>	lol this chan is useless at times =\
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Pelo>	Frog29,   2.6.20 I think
[negative]	[05:05]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: I can see my wireless router, but I time out trying to connect to it... then if i try again it says I'm connected but I'm still not
[negative]	[05:05]	<kondor101>	bimberi, actually, they might be trying to count downloads
[neutral]	[05:05]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: can you tell what version of gnome-network-manager do you have installed?
[negative]	[05:06]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, if it does, then you should be able to just use either network-admin and disable roaming mode, or the network-manager applet in the panel
[negative]	[05:06]	<Frog29>	Pelo - if that is so then that would explalian my problems
[neutral]	[05:06]	<Pelo>	whonicca,  I agree, but this is Upgrade day, waht do you expect
[neutral]	[05:06]	<gr3ml1n>	PresuntoRJ: 0.6.4
[negative]	[05:06]	<lisapc>	Feisty sits on my 2nd HDD, but Grub sits on my 1st HDD.  How can I install Grub on my 2nd HDD instead and then boot Ubuntu directly from 2nd HDD?  Anyone know pleasse?
[negative]	[05:06]	<CodingZen>	PresuntoRJ: do you know how i turn beryl on?
[negative]	[05:06]	<NemesisD>	am i to understand that beryl and compiz cannot be used in conjunction with eachother?
[neutral]	[05:06]	<r0bby_>	is there anywhere I can find the .config file used to compile the stock kernel?
[negative]	[05:06]	<steve_>	what happens if i delete the bottom panel?  will windows be automatically listed on the top panel?
[negative]	[05:06]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, ah
[neutral]	[05:06]	<bimberi>	r0bby_: /boot
[neutral]	[05:06]	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, is it definitely not a router issue?
[negative]	[05:06]	<Frog29>	Pelo - so /lib/muoles would have the kernel version?
[positive]	[05:06]	<RAOF>	NemesisD: Yes, indeed.  They are both window managers, and you can't have two programs managing your windows at the same time :)
[negative]	[05:06]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: someone here hinted that it may be because I have no password so there might be some issue with that
[positive]	[05:06]	<enderxim>	what kernel comes with the new feisty iso?

[neutral]	[05:07]	<bimberi>	enderxim: 2.6.20
[negative]	[05:07]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: paste the complete version back here
[neutral]	[05:07]	<Dial_tone>	who's done the inline upgrade yeet? any issues to report?
[negative]	[05:07]	<NemesisD>	RAOF, how can i try out beryl instead of compiz and vice versa? i think im on compiz right now
[positive]	[05:07]	<RAOF>	NemesisD: You can, however, have both Compiz & Beryl *installed* at the same time (and Metacity, and Kwin, and Fluxbox, and Sawfish, and ...)
[negative]	[05:07]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: I guess it could be, but I can use the internet just fine in windows (that's what I'm on now)

[neutral]	[05:08]	<Frog29>	Pelo- due to the lag and a lot o fothers?
[negative]	[05:08]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: it must come out a bunch of files and the full version numbers
[negative]	[05:08]	<lisapc>	can anyone tell me whats the command to install Grub onto my 2nd HDD?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<gr3ml1n>	PresuntoRJ:  0.6.4-6ubuntu7
[negative]	[05:08]	<kondor101>	i have this strange feeling that 7.04 is going to be the linux to really catch on
[neutral]	[05:08]	<grok_linux>	pathwap
[negative]	[05:08]	<Pelo>	Frog29,  that would be my guess
[negative]	[05:09]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: ok, you are using the latest
[positive]	[05:09]	<stefg>	lisapc: yes... by virtual drive swapping. bios takes 2nd hd as first hd... but still boots the /then/ first one
[neutral]	[05:09]	<lisapc>	kondor101, define strange

[negative]	[05:09]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: thanks, I'll try that, but I don't think I understand everything :o I'll ask my linux friend for detailed help though
[negative]	[05:09]	<Frog29>	Pelo - its under /lib/modules btw.... and i tihnk my problem is that the update did not update GRUB to have the most recent kernel version
[neutral]	[05:09]	<ricardo>	in feisty the soon nvidia one appears in boot?
[negative]	[05:09]	<stiv2k>	jesus
[negative]	[05:09]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: I have been following this bug reports on the Network-manager and it seemed ok
[negative]	[05:09]	<gr3ml1n>	PresuntoRJ: what now? i want to use static ip because i need to forward some port to it
[positive]	[05:09]	<lisapc>	stefg, be silent pls :)  you talking nonsense again!  I told you, i had Grub boot from my 2nd HDD before
[neutral]	[05:09]	<stiv2k>	i cant apt-get update without it timing out
[negative]	[05:09]	<lisapc>	Pelo, I did ask in grub
[negative]	[05:09]	<kondor101>	lisapc, well strange as in people have been saying that sort of thing for years, lol
[positive]	[05:09]	<arraista>	is anyone else experiencing *really* long times for installing due to repo servers traffic?
[negative]	[05:09]	<valermos>	"is anybody else having a problem with the fglrx driver under the new feisty? I'm getting an error ""PreInitDAL failed"""
[neutral]	[05:09]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: can you manually set it on the config file for the interface?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<ricardo>	in feisty the soon nvidia one appears in boot?
[negative]	[05:09]	<arnold-8891>	For some reason, after upgrading to Feisty, I am not finding any indication anywhere of the existence of a PCI wireless card I have installed in my desktop. Does anyone know how I could fix this?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<steelnub>	Do you guys help with Beryl here?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<lisapc>	kondor101, lol
[neutral]	[05:10]	<Dekkard>	only prob i have is sound recorder.. and audacity.. wont capture..
[negative]	[05:10]	<arraista>	i thought the repos would be somehow congested, but not this much...
[negative]	[05:10]	<mbpubuntu>	steelnub: there's a room for beryl
[neutral]	[05:10]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: try this: press Alt+F2
[neutral]	[05:10]	<Stoffer>	what's the best package to use for an ipod?
[neutral]	[05:10]	<knix_>	steelnub, go to #ubuntu-effects

[negative]	[05:10]	<ubotu>	kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see @HLINK  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see @HLINK

[neutral]	[05:10]	<RAOF>	"rellik_: By running ""lsb_release --release"" - It should return ""6.06"""
[positive]	[05:10]	<taggie>	sorry knix, i'm too slow :)
[neutral]	[05:10]	<NemesisD>	anyone know how to switch between beryl and compiz?
[negative]	[05:10]	<Pelo>	lisapc,   as a general rule I beleive you need to have grub install to which ever the boot drive is,  there woudn't be much point in having it install on another drive
[neutral]	[05:10]	<kondor101>	lisapc, but i have been using it for a week or so, and i think ive used terminal once in that time, thats a good sign
[negative]	[05:11]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: it might look like this: auto eth0
[neutral]	[05:11]	<PresuntoRJ>	iface eth0 inet dhcp
[neutral]	[05:11]	<slyfox>	Help. I have a 2nd hard drive which is formatted to ext3 as one big partition. Ubuntu does not mount it automatically for some reason. A sudo user always has to do this? How do I permanantly mount this hard drive so that other users can use it every time the computert starts.
[neutral]	[05:11]	<Pelo>	kondor101,  you're not trying hard enough
[positive]	[05:11]	<knix_>	taggie, no prob, :)
[neutral]	[05:11]	<Antioch>	Are there any drawbacks to using the 64-bit version of Ubuntu as opposed to the 32-bit version?
[neutral]	[05:11]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: put a # before the eth0 portion
[neutral]	[05:11]	<SuperLag>	slyfox: /etc/fstab
[neutral]	[05:11]	<knix_>	!update-manager-core
[negative]	[05:11]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: create new lines like this:

[neutral]	[05:11]	<kondor101>	Pelo, lol, maybe they are making it too easy
[neutral]	[05:11]	<Pelo>	slyfox,   edit fstab and add your second drive to it
[negative]	[05:11]	<rellik_>	RAOF, ah, thanks..  one last question..  is there a non-gui version of update-manager?  I'm doing this over SSH
[negative]	[05:11]	<RAOF>	Antioch: There's no 64bit flash player.  That's about it.
[negative]	[05:11]	<wooden719>	Wireless problem:  I just installed feisty on a dell x300 with a truemobile 1400 broadcom card.  I had hoped fiesty would just work to connect to wireless connections, but it's not.  The network config sees the device and I can configure it (or try at least), but it won't connect to any networks.  The System Monitor does correctly identify the card.  um... any help?  What info can I give you?
[negative]	[05:11]	<lisapc>	Pelo, you are dead wrong!  during POST, I press ESC and it gives me option to boot directly from first OR second hdd.  And I had edgy boot from 2nd HDD before.  So even if I took out my 1st hdd, I could still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd
[positive]	[05:12]	<Frog29>	Pelo - thanks for the help - i'll go post this on the forums - it works since grub did not get updated to have the most recent GRUB version
[positive]	[05:12]	<RAOF>	rellik_: I don't think so.  Also, trying to upgrade your stuff over SSH is a recipie for misery :)
[neutral]	[05:12]	<Dekkard>	rellik_,
[neutral]	[05:12]	<Dekkard>	 sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[05:12]	<eric>	hi. can someone tell me, where to find the grub settings? is there even a gui or should i edit the grub files?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: iface eth0 inet static
[negative]	[05:12]	<Antioch>	RAOF cant you use the 32-bit version on the 64-bit system? I thought tehre was backwards compatibility
[neutral]	[05:12]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: address 172.17.1.220
[negative]	[05:12]	<slyfox>	SuperLag: please tell me how exactly an entry for /dev/hdb/ and mount point /media/disk-1    should look like ?   it is an internal 2nd hard drive formatted to ext3 as one partition
[negative]	[05:12]	<rellik_>	RAOF, I have remote console access, in case SSH fails
[negative]	[05:12]	<mbpubuntu>	where's the best place to ask about ubuntu on intel macs?
[positive]	[05:12]	<lisapc>	Pelo, and thats a great idea in case of first hdd failure. this way I can still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd!  THINK before you speak ;)
[neutral]	[05:12]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n:  netmask 255.255.255.0
[negative]	[05:12]	<SuperLag>	I'm getting the iso downloaded faster than the mirrors can do update... Can you upgrade from the CD? or is apt the only way to do it?
[negative]	[05:12]	<stiv2k>	Flannel: what? thats ridiculous
[positive]	[05:12]	<kondor101>	eric, try typing grub into package manager
[neutral]	[05:12]	<PresuntoRJ>	network 172.17.1.0
[negative]	[05:12]	<Frog29>	eric - if you press escape at some point during start up (near the beggning) ou can get to the grub menu

[neutral]	[05:13]	<Frog29>	eric - from there you can select the correct ubuntu version and say e while it is highlighted.. then you can edit the settings temporarily.....
[positive]	[05:13]	<RAOF>	NemesisD: By selecting Beryl from the beryl manager, or alternatively heading to #ubuntu-effects
[neutral]	[05:13]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: or what ever is your network settings
[negative]	[05:13]	<Flannel>	"stiv2k: right.  Uh, except... I see a bug report of someone who has used that.  Does typing ""update"" and hitting tab twice, give you anything?"
[negative]	[05:13]	<Ademan>	"anyone know if theres a sort of ""irc bot platform"" out there?"
[neutral]	[05:13]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: did you get it?
[neutral]	[05:13]	<Dekkard>	Awperator,  that question may be answered better in a wine channel
[positive]	[05:13]	<RAOF>	Antioch: Yes, you can use the 32bit flashplayer, but you'll need a 32bit firefox, etc.  Basically, it's a bit more hassle.
[neutral]	[05:13]	<ryanakca>	it's sudo dpkg --force-remove-essential foobar      , right? (to remove an essential package) ... DISCLAIMER - use of force option can seriously damage your installation.
[neutral]	[05:13]	<kondor101>	1294 users lol
[negative]	[05:13]	<Frog29>	eric - press boot from there to boot using those settings.... if that's not what you needed you can also find the file under boot/grub/menu.lst
[negative]	[05:13]	<rellik_>	RAOF, no I don't have physical access to the machine. but the hosting provider provides remote console access, in case you mess up your firewall or lock yourself out someone..  it's an AJAX terminal

[neutral]	[05:14]	<Frog29>	eric - i meant press b
[neutral]	[05:14]	<j00p>	what is the official link to download the cd image??
[negative]	[05:14]	<ubuntu543217>	is it possible to install stuff on the liveCD? say, for example restricted drivers?
[neutral]	[05:14]	<gr3ml1n>	even though i set it to static with gnome network manager, the cfg says dhcp
[negative]	[05:14]	<gr3ml1n>	seems to be buggy
[negative]	[05:14]	<kondor101>	j00p, you want torrents?
[neutral]	[05:14]	<kondor101>	!torrents
[positive]	[05:14]	<ubotu>	Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:14]	<eric>	Frog29, i think i just gonna edit the menu.lst.
[negative]	[05:14]	<RAOF>	rellik_: What about if your Dapper->Edgy or Edgy->Feisty upgrade results in your network connection being broken?

[neutral]	[05:15]	<Pelo>	boomhowza,  this is it
[neutral]	[05:15]	<Flannel>	boomhowza: this is it
[negative]	[05:15]	<rellik_>	RAOF, the remote console doesn't rely on the host's internet connection..  the remote console sits on a seperate server, and connects as a terminal.  just like a console
[neutral]	[05:15]	<lisapc>	Pelo, u gave no fix
[negative]	[05:15]	<arraista>	"i am trying to install feisty here and got stuck in the ""scanning the mirror"" phase. anyone experiencing the same problem? I see the servers are a little busy, but it's been at lease 30 minutes since it got to this mirror thing"

[neutral]	[05:16]	<Flannel>	stiv2k: right.  Well, heres the bug: @HLINK we'll see how it goes.
[neutral]	[05:16]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[negative]	[05:16]	<RAOF>	rellik_: I don't *think* there's a CLI version of the update-manager, but you could just use X forwarding?
[negative]	[05:16]	<whonicca>	are u guys using ur own wallpapers, if so try to tile them, does it work?
[neutral]	[05:16]	<kofwang>	 Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!!
[negative]	[05:16]	<lisapc>	Pelo, you think, but you dont reason the thoughts, hence the reason your words are not coherent
[negative]	[05:16]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: verify if it started propperly with: sudo ip add
[neutral]	[05:16]	<kondor101>	ill have a look
[negative]	[05:16]	<DPic>	I need some help. I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear?
[negative]	[05:16]	<kofwang>	what's wrong with me?
[negative]	[05:16]	<whonicca>	im only able to mess around with the settings for default ubuntu wallpapers
[negative]	[05:16]	<stiv2k>	Flannel: i'm curious to see how stable feisty is if i can't even upgrade to it without running into bugs
[negative]	[05:16]	<Pelo>	I don'T like that guy
[negative]	[05:16]	<American-Tech_>	Whew got my ATI card in! Ok now to see if I can get beryl in
[neutral]	[05:17]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: or with: ifconfig
[positive]	[05:17]	<rellik_>	RAOF, yeah, I will try x-forwarding..  not ideal but ok :)
[negative]	[05:17]	<arooni>	how damn!  what do yo ufolks think of fesity?
[neutral]	[05:17]	<plewis77_>	 wooden719: download the windows wireless drivers. Then follow the directions to install. Make sure you have the Windows drivers. Here is a howto I used @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:17]	<disinterested>	i had a good mirror but it keeps going slower and slower

[negative]	[05:17]	<chino>	which init cna i switch to to get out of x11 mode ? i just wna tto go into multi user mode os i can confugre the box from ssh anyone know which innit ?
[negative]	[05:17]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: then, try to navigate
[negative]	[05:17]	<arooni>	should i upgrade now... or wait in a bit?
[negative]	[05:17]	<stiv2k>	Flannel: so how else do i upgrade?
[neutral]	[05:17]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: did it work?
[negative]	[05:17]	<Flannel>	stiv2k: eh, it was a miscommunication.  The people who put that on the webpage were going from one set of info (that it was there), and it mightve been yanked due to some issues
[negative]	[05:17]	<DPic>	I need some help. I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear so that i can use it?
[negative]	[05:17]	<eric>	Frog29, it won't let me edit the file. i think only root can..
[negative]	[05:17]	<Flannel>	stiv2k: Bottom of that page has instructions, basically just change your sources.list and dist-upgrade
[negative]	[05:17]	<SuperLag>	slyfox: are you registered to nickserv?
[neutral]	[05:17]	<wasabi__>	chino: Debian based distros don't use a seperate init mode for X.
[negative]	[05:17]	<wasabi__>	chino: So the answer is, stop GDM.
[negative]	[05:17]	<stiv2k>	Flannel: is it safe to do that?
[neutral]	[05:18]	<chino>	wasabi__: how ?
[negative]	[05:18]	<slyfox>	SuperLag: no, I do not know how
[neutral]	[05:18]	<chino>	im using kubuntu
[neutral]	[05:18]	<whonicca>	kondor101, wooden719, does it work?
[positive]	[05:18]	<j00p>	can i overwrite my actual ubuntu files to replace by feisty with the live cd ?

[negative]	[05:18]	<chino>	wtf... why dont you have a none desktop mode
[negative]	[05:18]	<chino>	ok
[positive]	[05:18]	<kondor101>	whonicca, yes the tile effect works
[neutral]	[05:18]	<Flannel>	stiv2k: of course.  All update-manager stuff does is make sure oyu have the proper metapackages.  ubuntu-minial and ubuntu-standard and stuff
[neutral]	[05:18]	<stiv2k>	Flannel: they say on the page its less reliable
[positive]	[05:18]	<Awperator>	Can anyone please answer my wine question? No one seems to be in the wine channel. Pm me if you can. Thanks :)

[neutral]	[05:19]	<kondor101>	whonicca, i downloaded a small image (the ubuntu symbol off distro watch) set it as background, it stretched, i changed it to tiled, it tiled
[negative]	[05:19]	<American-Tech_>	Any how to out there to install beryl?
[negative]	[05:19]	<PresuntoRJ>	gr3ml1n: dhcp and gnome-network-manager sets it, but you might need to handle yourself while manully editing the files
[positive]	[05:19]	<RAOF>	Flannel, stiv2k: Actually, upgrade-manager does more than just install meta-packages.  It also does some config changes to make Feisty *work* (such as looking at /etc/fstab, and making sure it'll survive the hda->sda rename, etc)
[neutral]	[05:19]	<Dekkard>	!beryl

[neutral]	[05:34]	<ajax4>	SuperLag: I did a clean install, though there were options to upgrade from CD also.
[neutral]	[05:35]	<Frog29>	presuntoRJ - a lot
[neutral]	[05:35]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: I have lo (for localhost) eth0 (for wired) wlan0 (wifi) and sit0
[neutral]	[05:35]	<mellow_bunny>	Nerdz: yes
[negative]	[05:35]	<MrMakeveli>	i was on xchat before i upgraded, now it looks all fresh an whathave you
[negative]	[05:35]	<lisapc>	Pelo, make a note of what I did for your future refence
[positive]	[05:35]	<Nerdz>	Thanks
[positive]	[05:35]	<compilerwriter>	konversation is a really nice suite if you are a power user mrmakeveli.
[negative]	[05:35]	<labanux>	Nerdz :yes.., but if you're not sure, just go here @HLINK there's alternate cd right there
[negative]	[05:35]	<SuperLag>	ajax4: sweet. I got a decent connection to a mirror, and I'm about 25% into the download
[negative]	[05:35]	<JebJoya>	umm, right, when i boot i get a load of errors about my gnome window manager - i tried to move to compiz using beryl while watching a video in vlc, it crashed so i ctrl-alt-backspaced, crashed out to command prompt, ctrl-alt-del'ed and... well, nothing's working... any suggestions?  using the alternate boot cd perhaps?
[negative]	[05:35]	<Frog29>	presuntoRJ - 3 connection.... 1 loopback, one eth0 as nocarrier broadcast and up, the other eth1 as broadcast and multicast
[positive]	[05:35]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: each one must have its own IP address to work, wich means, it found the network and its DHCP, and therefore it is working
[neutral]	[05:35]	<MrMakeveli>	i wish that it would highlight convos in red the way xchat would. now im on the gnome xchat and it just beeps
[negative]	[05:35]	<yeniklasor>	hi, if I upgrade all my programs will remove? is it a format?
[negative]	[05:36]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: no IP... no good
[neutral]	[05:36]	<Flannel>	yeniklasor: no
[negative]	[05:36]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: hum... let me think
[negative]	[05:36]	<ajax4>	SuperLag: Are you using bittorrent?
[neutral]	[05:36]	<Vaske_Car>	Any fast FTP to download 7.04?
[neutral]	[05:36]	<xechostor>	is there an install dvd available for fiest? cant find one, only the cd
[negative]	[05:36]	<SuperLag>	ajax4: no, just a straight wget from a mirror

[neutral]	[05:36]	<SuperLag>	ajax4: IndianaU
[negative]	[05:36]	<MrMakeveli>	hmm i dont think that worked
[negative]	[05:36]	<Siph0n>	does the server edition not come with a gui already installed?
[negative]	[05:36]	<yeniklasor>	Frannel : is it like a core upgrade?
[negative]	[05:36]	<Frog29>	presuntoRJ - i know eth1 is my wireless since it has an extra bar at the bottom saying signal strenth( its empty)
[negative]	[05:36]	<labanux>	RAOF : you're HDA Intel soundcard works doesn't it? but, what kind of upgrade method do you use? fresh install or upgrade with apt?
[neutral]	[05:36]	<mellow_bunny>	Siph0n: no

[neutral]	[05:37]	<compilerwriter>	mrmakeveli yes
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Flannel>	yeniklasor: it'll upgrade everything
[negative]	[05:37]	<ap1>	I got sudo garbled. I tried to apt-get remove/install it (recovery boot) but accidentally deleted a couple of dependent packages. I don't see anything in the logs. Does apt log somewhere a list of removed pkgs so I can re-install them?
[negative]	[05:37]	<wooden719>	frog29, what's your wireless card type? broadcom? integrated?
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Flannel>	ap1: dpkg keeps logs
[positive]	[05:37]	<labanux>	Vaske_Car : select mirror closest to your home.. :)

[negative]	[05:37]	<jooby>	hey weird problem here - can't get nm-manager applet to display
[negative]	[05:37]	<Flannel>	ap1: but, just reinstallling sudo should reinstall the dependencies

[negative]	[05:37]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[positive]	[05:38]	<Pelo>	lisapc,   good for you,  I am in awe of your 1337ness
[negative]	[05:38]	<Frog29>	wooden719 ubuntu recognizes the card and something that seems to be just like it
[negative]	[05:38]	<RAOF>	labanux: My card works, yes.  But I've been running Feisty since before Christmas.  The upgrade method shouldn't affect it, though.
[negative]	[05:38]	<Nerdz>	What's the difference between live CD and alternate?
[negative]	[05:38]	<wooden719>	frog29, i'm seeing the same thing you're seeing
[negative]	[05:38]	<compilerwriter>	vaske_car then cross yourself, light a cigar and drink some congac this might take a while.
[positive]	[05:38]	<lisapc>	Pelo, and I am in awe of your ignorance :)
[neutral]	[05:38]	<ajax4>	SuperLag: Restarting my system now....will soon find out if the Nvidia drivers installed correctly.

[positive]	[05:38]	<yeniklasor>	Flannel : my files and my installed 3 rd programs won't delete yeah?

[neutral]	[05:38]	<Flannel>	Nerdz: Alternate CD is textmode installer only (no liveCD), contains addiional install options (gui-less, OEM, etc), and has a package repository on it with additional packages
[neutral]	[05:38]	<Nerdz>	roller: ok Thanks
[neutral]	[05:39]	<Flannel>	yeniklasor: correct.  They'll just all be upgraded
[neutral]	[05:39]	<yeniklasor>	OK thanks
[negative]	[05:39]	<xechostor>	one other question. Is audigy sound working properly out of the box, as they say? (integrated audigy SE here on a MSI K9N Diamond Mobo )
[positive]	[05:39]	<seamus7>	Even though I chose the Alternate CD Upgrade ... it's still connecting to the network for updates ... which means I'm still experiencing a very slow upgrad process
[negative]	[05:39]	<crimsun>	labanux: looks like alsa oss emulation modules aren't loaded.
[negative]	[05:39]	<jooby>	anyone know why an applet refuses to display?
[negative]	[05:39]	<eureka>	I'm trying to view an image , it's pointing to the right location, and the image was there, however I still got a broken image when viewing, another interesting thing is that I can't see the image through samba, but I can list it using ls. What's wrong?
[neutral]	[05:39]	<wastrel>	ceil420:  Qt is a graphics toolkit used to create a GUI.  it's not bad, some people dislike it- some people like it. it's an opinion thing.
[neutral]	[05:39]	<roller>	plus; lets you update from edgy and install in oem
[negative]	[05:39]	<labanux>	crimsun: how can i fix this?
[negative]	[05:39]	<crimsun>	labanux: please download and use the script linked from @HLINK , then tell me the URL of the paste.

[negative]	[05:40]	<ceil420>	wastrel, ah. the person i quoted that from is the hardcore type. slackware and all.
[neutral]	[05:40]	<ap1>	Flannel, no, reinstalling sudo does not reinstall things that were dependent _on: sudo
[negative]	[05:40]	<labanux>	crimsun: wait a minute..
[negative]	[05:40]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - from research i had done earlier it seems as if the dell thing has the same driver
[positive]	[05:40]	<ceil420>	thanks
[neutral]	[05:40]	<wastrel>	ceil420:  kde uses qt , gnome uses gtk.
[negative]	[05:40]	<Flannel>	ap1: Ah.  Gotcha.  Yeah, check dpkg logs.
[negative]	[05:40]	<ceil420>	oh, i see
[neutral]	[05:40]	<ceil420>	Xfce uses gtk too doesn't it?
[negative]	[05:40]	<wastrel>	dunno from xfce
[negative]	[05:41]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29:  same chipsete I guess... not really sure, it appears you are in a nimbo between heaven and hell, I mean, with and without wi fi
[negative]	[05:41]	<Flannel>	ap1: but, uh, ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-minimal (and ubuntu-desktop) should (I think?) cover most of them.  If you cant get a list from your logs for whaever reason
[neutral]	[05:41]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: its detected and started but somehow it wont realy network

[neutral]	[05:41]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - i think i just need to tell it to start.... if i remember there is some command to tell it to but i triesd it a few weeks ago on 6.10
[neutral]	[05:42]	<labanux>	crimsun: it tells me to go to the #alsa room.. and see this : @HLINK
[negative]	[05:42]	<Flannel>	ap1: ubuntu-minimal is dependant on sudo.  It appears thats the only one
[negative]	[05:42]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: you could try to locate a similar bug report (if any) on @HLINK regarding wifi with your card chipset
[negative]	[05:42]	<crimsun>	labanux: yes, run the script. I helped develop that script.

[neutral]	[05:43]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - hmmm
[positive]	[05:44]	<bobbob1016>	Hi all, I have what I think is a simple question.  If I reinstall Feisty on my PC, and I already have different partitions for my home, and my /, will I lose any of my settings?
[negative]	[05:44]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: do you know how to?
[neutral]	[05:44]	<mellow_bunny>	bobbob1016: not if you map corectly
[neutral]	[05:44]	<RAOF>	bobbob1016: Some, kinda.
[negative]	[05:44]	<letronje>	Pelo: yes i do , but it seems the in.archive.ubuntu.com is not responding, so installation is not proceeding firther
[negative]	[05:44]	<eobanb>	bobbob1016, if you have different partitions, but only format the partitions that do not contain your home, etc, then you will not lose settings.
[negative]	[05:44]	<RAOF>	bobbob1016: As long as you don't format your /home, you won't lose your personal settings.
[neutral]	[05:44]	<eobanb>	bobbob1016, you must be sure to specify those partitions for your /home, etc, when installing
[neutral]	[05:44]	<RAOF>	bobbob1016: Anything in /etc/ will be lost, though.
[neutral]	[05:44]	<eobanb>	just dont overwrite them
[positive]	[05:44]	<mellow_bunny>	etc holds system settings
[neutral]	[05:44]	<bobbob1016>	I wasn't sure about my beryl settings
[positive]	[05:44]	<Pelo>	letronje,   servers are very busy atm
[neutral]	[05:44]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - do what?
[negative]	[05:45]	<eobanb>	bobbob1016, why are you reinstalling?
[negative]	[05:45]	<bobbob1016>	I know not to format my home partition, I just wasn't sure what gets lost

[neutral]	[05:45]	<Flannel>	!automatix | brian|lfs
[negative]	[05:45]	<ubotu>	brian|lfs: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[negative]	[05:45]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - huh if i say ifconfig it only shows eth0 and lo
[neutral]	[05:45]	<brian|lfs>	Iya and the mirros are slow
[negative]	[05:45]	<Pelo>	billy,  sudo make install,  but read the readme / install files in the tr.gz first    there might be an installer
[neutral]	[05:45]	<letronje>	Pelo: ok thnx, so keeping additional repositories in sources.list wont break the upgrade right?
[negative]	[05:46]	<PresuntoRJ>	Frog29: you could try to locate a similar bug report at @HLINK searching for a similar bug report some one might have posted (regarding your chipset)
[negative]	[05:46]	<Flannel>	brian|lfs: Don't use automatix.  simple as that.  It's nothing *but* problems
[positive]	[05:46]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - using -a it shows eth1

[negative]	[05:46]	<Pelo>	letronje,  as far as I know ( and I havewn't upgraded yet) the third party repos get disabled during the upgrade

[negative]	[05:49]	<Kickboy>	"I need some assistance with my 6.10 to 7.04 upgrade. I tried doing the upgrade through the update manager, but it was taking waaay too long. So I stopped it, and downloaded the ""Alternate CD"" to do it from there (Since BitTorrent is faster, it took only 20 minutes to DL). Well, now because I stopped the first upgrade ALL of my packwages are no longer authenticated, making it completely impossible for me to upgrade."

[neutral]	[05:54]	<zero88>	bimberi so its jsut basically for hardware and optimization?
[negative]	[05:54]	<Frog29>	PresuntoRJ - any chance it has the wrong driver?

[negative]	[05:55]	<Nergar>	whats the devs channel???
[negative]	[05:55]	<RAOF>	zero88: The only time you'd want to compile your own kernel is when the new kernel supports a piece of hardware you have, and the Ubuntu kernel doesn't.

[negative]	[05:57]	<blrich>	RAOF, yeah i have no drivers for my network card because it's on a new mobo with nforce 430 chipset, i need to get the restricted drivers package for it to work (or so i'm trying)

[negative]	[05:58]	<blrich>	Flannel, okay cool, but where do i find the .deb downloads? there doesn't seem to be any links to a .deb on the individual package pages
[positive]	[05:58]	<albert>	flannel: found everything, thanks
[negative]	[05:58]	<jessid>	Fujitsu mmm sorry...did not want to bother...perhaps you know something about compiling the kernel with the keyspan driver...or you might know where to go first...
[positive]	[05:58]	<Flannel>	blrich: on each package's page, at the bottom, is a little table with different arches.  Click your arch, and you'll be able to choose a mirror to download a specific .deb file. install that with dpkg (don't forget dependencies!)
[neutral]	[05:58]	<Shaddox>	Fujitsu: Can you explain how? I'm still a ubuntu nubcaek, and finally got Cedega working for my Steam and stuff.
[negative]	[05:58]	<crimsun>	bobbob1016: please pastebin `cat /proc/asound/cards && amixer` , then tell me the URL of the paste
[negative]	[05:58]	<blrich>	RAOF, a-ha, should i a cd repos in apt sources to get it off?
[negative]	[05:58]	<Flannel>	blrich: OH wait.
[negative]	[05:58]	<Shaddox>	SuperLag: Is it easier then what Fujitsu said? I'm extremely confused. X_x
[negative]	[05:58]	<T0uCH>	i had a power failure earlier today during the installation of feisty 7.04... the installation has stop... but now the problem is i cant restart the install of the packages that we're installed on the first upgrades(the one with the power failure) and it seems now that upgrades manager is installing version 6.10 ... i allready got this one... somebody can help what i should do now?
[neutral]	[05:58]	<Flannel>	blrich: You need ndiswrapper?
[negative]	[05:58]	<blrich>	Flannel, ah cool thankyou!

[negative]	[05:59]	<SuperLag>	Shaddox: are you on the machine you want to copy to?
[neutral]	[05:59]	<wj32>	can i upgrade easily from edgy to feisty using the desktop cd?
[negative]	[05:59]	<SuperLag>	blrich: why not?
[negative]	[05:59]	<Hasrat_USA>	how come you had a power failure?
[negative]	[05:59]	<RAOF>	blrich: But does it *really* not have a driver for it out of the box?  That sucks.
[negative]	[05:59]	<Flannel>	blrich: Restricted drivers?  That's not a package.  But, ndiswrapper is on the CD you have, you dont need to sneakernet, youve already got it
[negative]	[05:59]	<wj32>	i'm currently going to upgrade using the alternate cd

[negative]	[06:00]	<RAOF>	Flannel: But it's not a wireless network card?
[negative]	[06:00]	<blrich>	Flannel, RAOF, SuperLag, the problem is when i run lspci, it just has tonnes of 'unknown nvidia device'. the built in ethernet on the board has drivers for it, but (i think) because i don't have drivers for the system bus (nforce 430 drivers) i can't even get the system to see the ethernet either
[negative]	[06:00]	<Flannel>	RAOF: What?  Oh.  Sorry. blrich, I wasnt paying attention I guess.

[negative]	[06:34]	<BlackDalek>	how do I install bollox?
[negative]	[06:34]	<Draconicus>	zcat[1] : I'm quite skilled now at making the beta run, as is evidenced in this machine, so I'm not really worried. I just expected less bugs after all that testing and after such stability when I installed this beta.
[negative]	[06:34]	<mjbrooks>	guitrokr, as you may have noticed, we're pretty busy
[neutral]	[06:34]	<dxdemetriou>	deepsa, I tried it many times to redo the upgrade. maybe I'll put manually the file to archives
[neutral]	[06:34]	<Frog29>	Diabolix - now the question is...... are those the drivers fulyl isntalled? or only partly?
[negative]	[06:34]	<s0undt3ch>	EverythingEvil2: is that why my gigabit is detected but not loaded?
[neutral]	[06:34]	<guitrokr>	is it always like this?
[negative]	[06:34]	<diabolix>	"Frog29: cool.. now it you want 3d install the official driver and change that line to ""nvidia"".. but at least its more usuable for now..."
[positive]	[06:34]	<nothlit>	guitrokr: you haven't actually asked your question
[positive]	[06:34]	<deepsa>	dxdemetriou: repos slow today

[negative]	[06:34]	<ubotu>	"guitrokr: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with ""Does anyone/anybody...""  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?"
[neutral]	[06:34]	<guitrokr>	prior to this
[negative]	[06:34]	<milage>	"Is the ""Shared Folders"" control panel in the administration menu supposed to work?"
[negative]	[06:34]	<Gumby>	guitrokr: sometimes you have to ask your question multiple times as either there are not enough people to answer or no one that is able to answer actually knows the answer
[negative]	[06:34]	<milage>	I can't seem to make it work at least
[negative]	[06:34]	<deepsa>	dxdemetriou: possibility that you get bad downloads for a while we are on that

[negative]	[06:34]	<diabolix>	Frog29: you are using the open source driver.. its good enough for regular use, but not 3d.
[negative]	[06:34]	<milage>	So it would be nice of someone in here has any idea how to use it
[negative]	[06:34]	<nomasteryoda>	Black_, ask, don't ask to ask

[positive]	[06:43]	<guitrokr>	so i could in theory nudge the existing primary partition to the right and let the installer create a partition in the newly unallocated space within the 1024 cylinder boundary?

[neutral]	[06:43]	<diabolix>	"Frog29: from the command line, try running ""dhclient eth0"" after you connect it."
[negative]	[06:43]	<Tarkus>	is it good to burn at maximum speed (iso image). or is it better to do slower?

[negative]	[06:45]	<diabolix>	Frog29: the fact that it lists the device means it found the driver for it, but it doesn't have a network to connect to.
[neutral]	[06:45]	<munkymunkyman>	hello
[negative]	[06:45]	<milage>	I think there should be an option to do that with the GUi tool

[neutral]	[06:46]	<bamb1>	lol
[negative]	[06:46]	<BlackDalek>	I restarted gaim and now copy paste works again. Is copy/paste functionality locking up like that a special feature of gaim which requires a program restart?
[negative]	[06:46]	<Frog29>	Diabolix - it seems as if it isn't even trying with feisty
[neutral]	[06:46]	<Meshezabeel>	k-edgy: don't think you can add iso directly to the repository, but if you burn it to a cd you can add the cd, there is also a way you can mount an iso, but that's beyond me
[negative]	[06:46]	<deepsa>	umop: i know but i guess you don't know and that's why i don't want to let you know. but if you want then you can apt-get gparted

[neutral]	[06:46]	<Madpilot>	bamb1, use Add/Remove Apps, search for xchat
[negative]	[06:46]	<munkymunkyman>	why does it down grade
[positive]	[06:46]	<diabolix>	Frog29: it wont send packets until it has a network.

[negative]	[06:53]	<billy>	deCon, well, honestly that was only an example.  it may read something different.  but you need to know the device name of your /home partition.  sudo fdisk -l in terminal.
[positive]	[06:53]	<diabolix>	Frog29: maybe youre manufacturer has a support site with drivers?
[negative]	[06:53]	<function1>	darwin: ive heard good things about deluge too. havent tried it.
[negative]	[06:54]	<s0undt3ch>	deepsa: yeah, that was for 6.10, does feisty provide it? I had similar problems
[neutral]	[06:54]	<Frog29>	Diabolix - i hoep so.......
[neutral]	[06:54]	<deepsa>	s0undt3ch: yeah feisty provides it
[positive]	[06:54]	<billy>	Madpilot, :)  I'm sorry dude.   /opt really, truly honestly isn't there.  Can I post a screenshot somewhere?
[negative]	[06:54]	<deepsa>	s0undt3ch: have you problems with feisty too man? same problem?
[negative]	[06:54]	<s0undt3ch>	deepsa: ok, I'll go into live cd and try to re-grab info
[negative]	[06:54]	<acidtabs>	is there a program that would alow you to stream shoutcast radio station?

[negative]	[06:54]	<Madpilot>	billy, sure, but I don't know why it's missing. Is this a clean install of Ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:54]	<diabolix>	Frog29: if you know where it is...
[negative]	[06:54]	<darwin>	function1: Azureus never worked right for me. I've had a better experience running utorrent under wine.
[neutral]	[06:54]	<billy>	Madpilot, yes.

[positive]	[06:55]	<Shrimpy_>	thanks deepsa
[negative]	[06:55]	<deCon>	billy, you mean /dev/sda2 or media/sda2?
[neutral]	[06:55]	<deepsa>	Shrimpy_: np
[neutral]	[06:55]	<diabolix>	Frog29: you need a .sys file, and a .inf file. they usually have the same name.
[negative]	[06:55]	<billy>	Shrimpy_, because root owns the file you have to prefix with sudo.  sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[negative]	[06:55]	<Frog29>	Diabolix - and? ok.... well let me go get intenret
[neutral]	[06:55]	<darwin>	function1: Just a little buggy
[positive]	[06:55]	<Meshezabeel>	darwin, I would give Azureus another try, works great for me, and without getting into an argument, I'd say in some ways azureus is better than utorrent
[positive]	[06:56]	<deCon>	i love azureus
[positive]	[06:56]	<jlowell>	is metisse available for ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:56]	<s0undt3ch>	deepsa: I'm now loading feity, I'll try to provide that info again
[positive]	[06:56]	<function1>	azureus is much more feature rich, but utorrent is so lite and cute
[negative]	[06:56]	<ap1>	My Laptop Intel WLAn chip seems to be off (IBM z69m) indicator light is off. Otherwise, iwconfig shows things seem to be partly ok, but no association. Should the indicator light be on also on Ubuntu? Or is it Windows controlled?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<infinityxi>	azureus was crapping out on me when it was using sun java 1.5. I had to set it to run on gij
[negative]	[06:56]	<deepsa>	s0undt3ch: sure i'll be waiting
[positive]	[06:56]	<billy>	deCon, by default, Feisty will want to mount your current /home partition to /media/sda2.  There will be a point int the install process when you will be able to change the mount point to /home.
[neutral]	[06:56]	<alienseer23>	Q: can anyone provide a link to upgrade features for fiesty?
[positive]	[06:56]	<darwin>	Meshezabeel: Azureus has more features but more bloat and sometimes it won't start up at all
[positive]	[06:56]	<s0undt3ch>	deepsa: k, Thanks
[negative]	[06:56]	<Shrimpy_>	deepsa: i  know there is more of a ui one. do you happen to know it. like x-org somthing. sorry its been a while

[positive]	[07:00]	<umop>	deepsa, Hmm, I still dont see where in gparted I can merge the partitions.
[positive]	[07:00]	<RAOF>	ccfiel: Your card is supported with the open-source drivers.  Use them!

[negative]	[07:01]	<RAOF>	ccfiel: Is your card really not supported.  ATI sucks :(
[neutral]	[07:01]	<wm_eddie>	I only have a /dev/sda
[negative]	[07:01]	<mjbrooks>	toddian, you wouldn't happen to have some usb devices plugged into it do you?
[negative]	[07:02]	<toddian>	I do actually
[neutral]	[07:02]	<toddian>	got an ipod plugged in
[negative]	[07:02]	<diabolix>	too bad you can't import settings from another distro...
[neutral]	[07:02]	<jd>	is there a good place to post log files?
[positive]	[07:02]	<toddian>	mjbrooks: has that been known to cause problems?
[negative]	[07:02]	<DARKGuy>	Hey, I'm installing the new ubuntu and I see something about a migration assistant, allowing me to choose stuff from my Windows drive... could anyone tell me what is this and what it's suppossed to do, and if it's safe to do what it asks?
[negative]	[07:02]	<jd>	like some type of file host?
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Meshezabeel>	jd pastebin.ca ?
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Meshezabeel>	jd @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:02]	<umop>	Does anyone know if gparted 0.2.5 supports merging partitions?
[neutral]	[07:02]	<mjbrooks>	toddian, some people have said that there are boot issues with devices plugged in to the extended usb ports of that mobo
[negative]	[07:02]	<ccfiel>	RAOF: yes ATI sucks. so i want to buy NVidia.  do you an info that shows list the supported and no head ached installed the restricted driver?
[negative]	[07:03]	<toddian>	okay, so try unplugging and restarting with it?
[neutral]	[07:03]	<diabolix>	DARKGuy: it will attempt to import settings from you're windows partition, like bookmarks and email settings.
[negative]	[07:03]	<billy>	DARKGuy, contents of C:\Documents and Settings\ (some anyway, pictures, music, etc.)
[negative]	[07:03]	<toddian>	also, would it be better to use the amd64 version or i386 version of ubuntu
[negative]	[07:03]	<toddian>	cuz I want to run cedega and crossover office
[negative]	[07:03]	<ccfiel>	cldb: how about fx 6200? can this be a good video card?
[negative]	[07:03]	<mjbrooks>	toddian, yeah, you might also need to actually go further and disable the extended usb in the bios
[negative]	[07:03]	<tom__>	is it still ok just to update with a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade on an updated sources.list
[neutral]	[07:03]	<jlowell>	has anyone used metisse on ubuntu?
[negative]	[07:03]	<ap1>	Should I install news firmware on Edgy for my ThinkPad z60m Intel 2916ABG WLAN card? Because it seems to be dead?
[negative]	[07:03]	<DARKGuy>	diabolix, billy: I see, thanks. Hopefully this Feisty doesn't have any ntfs writing module so it's safe, right?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<nonuda>	any1 here use gambas?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<billy>	DARKGuy, and what diabolix said.
[negative]	[07:04]	<toddian>	just an option in the bios?
[negative]	[07:04]	<ubuntu>	if I use a amd64 ubuntu, will I be able to play doom3 or quake4 on it?
[negative]	[07:04]	<billy>	DARKGuy, not by default, no ntfs writing.
[negative]	[07:04]	<mjbrooks>	toddian, I'd use the 386 there are soem issues with 64  like no flash plugins for example
[negative]	[07:04]	<diabolix>	DARKGuy: it will mount it read only, you should have nothing to worry about..
[negative]	[07:04]	<tom__>	ubuntu: unless you need more than 4 gigs of ram, just use the x86 ubuntu
[positive]	[07:04]	<DARKGuy>	Thanks a lot, diabolix & billy :D
[positive]	[07:04]	<billy>	DARKGuy, right on.  :)
[negative]	[07:04]	<toddian>	yeah that would be a problem, cool. I'm still downloading it but I'll restart and see if the amd 64 cd will at least boot
[neutral]	[07:04]	<toddian>	brb
[negative]	[07:05]	<mjbrooks>	toddian, that's what they say
[negative]	[07:05]	<DARKGuy>	"What's with the ""create an user for importing inside the selected account"" ?"
[positive]	[07:05]	<deCon>	how is software for 64 bit, and does 32 bit software still work fine under 64bitamd?
[negative]	[07:05]	<s0undt3ch>	dam, how do I mount a pen RW and not just R?
[negative]	[07:05]	<wm_eddie>	Doh, my CDROM drive isn't in the hardware information at all >_<
[negative]	[07:05]	<tom__>	deCon: i've got a 64 bit amd chip here and i just use 32 bit
[negative]	[07:05]	<billy>	DARKGuy, you can set it to be someone other than yourself.  Put your own user name and password in there if you want it for you.

[neutral]	[07:05]	<lalala>	correct?
[neutral]	[07:05]	<Ashex>	since the main ubuntu repos are being hammered
[negative]	[07:05]	<diabolix>	out of curiosity, has anyone tried beryl in vesa mode?
[positive]	[07:05]	<siti>	64bit requires more work but will be faster due to compiler optimizations
[negative]	[07:05]	<tom__>	deCon: the only need for 64 bit is if you use more than 4 gigs of ram
[negative]	[07:06]	<darwin>	Why do some programs not work well with Compiz?
[neutral]	[07:06]	<deCon>	tom__, thats what i thought, but is 64bit worth it yet? Cuz i'm on 32bit edgy right now...
[negative]	[07:06]	<Ashex>	in theory, if I use the canadian servers, they should be experiencing a lighter load, right?
[positive]	[07:06]	<DARKGuy>	billy: But I haven't made any linux user accounts yet. Lemme see... does this creates a new user for importing the windows data in, or does it create a new user in the windows system? I'm kinda confused
[negative]	[07:06]	<tom__>	deCon: like i said, only if you need mroe than four gigs of ram
[negative]	[07:06]	<billy>	diabolix, yes.  in edgy.  didn't work.
[neutral]	[07:06]	<diabolix>	darwin: because compiz is under development.
[negative]	[07:06]	<Ax4>	i don't think enough applications currently take advantage of 64bit chips
[negative]	[07:06]	<Ax4>	:S
[negative]	[07:06]	<deCon>	tom__, see ya, cuz my 1gb is fast as hell, but it was overloaded by too much in windows

[negative]	[07:06]	<billy>	DARKGuy, creates new user in ubuntu.  yeah, it's confusing.  just put the same username each time if you want it for yourself.
[neutral]	[07:06]	<tom__>	deCon: ype
[positive]	[07:07]	<Meshezabeel>	deCon: yes, but beryl is still in beta
[neutral]	[07:07]	<Ashex>	Meshezabeel, I've downloaded the dvd with torrent and I'm currently seeding
[negative]	[07:07]	<Ashex>	I'm talking about the repos
[positive]	[07:07]	<DARKGuy>	I see, thanks billy :D
[negative]	[07:07]	<siti>	Ax4: almost every open source app can be recompiled as a 64bit binary, at the very least ubuntu can allow more optimizations like sse, sse2, and 16 register support
[neutral]	[07:07]	<jd>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[07:07]	<diabolix>	it is kind of nice that you can use irc while installing...
[negative]	[07:07]	<siti>	Ax4: benchmarks vary, but I guess it's about 10% faster
[negative]	[07:07]	<tom__>	siti: the problem isn't the open source apps, its the closed source one
[negative]	[07:07]	<Ashex>	there is currently no true advantage to running a 64-bit system IMO as a desktop
[neutral]	[07:07]	<diabolix>	livecd+installer in one is awsome.
[positive]	[07:07]	<Ax4>	siti: yea definitely  not enough YET :p
[negative]	[07:07]	<siti>	tom__: yeah :(
[negative]	[07:07]	<darwin>	I don't think it was a good idea to package feisty with compiz since it's still under development
[negative]	[07:07]	<tom__>	Axhex: agreed

[neutral]	[07:08]	<DARKGuy>	billy: cool!
[negative]	[07:08]	<diabolix>	64 bit is over rated.. even for things its supposed to be good at.
[positive]	[07:08]	<siti>	Ax4: it will never increase in performance, it will only be a must have when many people have 4GB or more as people have said
[negative]	[07:08]	<megafauna>	even tuxcart is slow to d/l
[negative]	[07:08]	<Whiz2>	anyone in here know anything about configuring the linux package named exim4?
[neutral]	[07:08]	<Ashex>	sure, it may run a little bit faster, but you don't really get anything out of it
[negative]	[07:08]	<billy>	Now it's time to fix the dialup.  :/
[negative]	[07:08]	<tom__>	diabolix: it's useful if you need that much ram
[positive]	[07:08]	<Ashex>	Servers are the platform that really benefits from it
[neutral]	[07:08]	<Ax4>	siti: that'll be the day when we need 4gb per desktop workstation.... lol
[negative]	[07:09]	<diabolix>	tom__: or if you need >2gb per process.

[positive]	[07:22]	<Madpilot>	cables, earlier today, apparently
[positive]	[07:23]	<k1gwb>	resizing with gparted never works for me
[negative]	[07:23]	<cables>	Madpilot, yeah there was, right after release in #ubuntu-release-party. I thought maybe there was another right now 'cause i saw you unbanning people.
[negative]	[07:23]	<user01>	should i do a clean install from edgy?
[negative]	[07:23]	<DARKGuy>	=/

[negative]	[07:23]	<DARKGuy>	what about it?
[negative]	[07:23]	<mjbrooks>	ianfromsydney, the only thing I can think of is that maybe your dvd writer is having trouble    try stealing you roommates CD drive temporarily
[negative]	[07:23]	<chowmeined>	so with xen using the processor extensions.. can I use regular drivers in windows? Like.. can I do nvidia 3D drivers if I have an nvidia card?

[neutral]	[07:24]	<Madpilot>	cables, yes, we banforward anyone dropped by a D C C  attack to #ubuntu-read-topic
[negative]	[07:24]	<nexact>	considering I have /dev/hda, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, on which partition should I install my MBR ? /dev/sda will hold linux.
[negative]	[07:24]	<DARKGuy>	maybe you don't have the kernel sources or libraries or headers or anything to compile source with and it didn't compile a kernel module for virtualbox and that's why it's not finding it?
[negative]	[07:24]	<deCon>	myUserName, and i have a 7800 on 32 just fine..must be 64
[negative]	[07:24]	<myUserName>	Kickersny, yeah i figured 64bit was the part causing the bug
[positive]	[07:24]	<Crypt>	Jordan_U: how well does ubuntu run on a dual booting system?
[negative]	[07:25]	<cables>	Madpilot, yeah, I know... that's why I was wondering. Isn't that sorta thing a pretty easily bot-able task?

[negative]	[07:25]	<myUserName>	I have read a few other people have had similar problems in google but its to early to get a proper fix for it so far I think (at least via google)
[negative]	[07:25]	<vega->	nexact: /dev/hda would be a good guess
[positive]	[07:25]	<Madpilot>	cables, we try not to give bots op powers, as a general rule
[positive]	[07:25]	<Jordan_U>	Crypt, Just fine, you will not be able to get 3D acceleration unless you have an ATi card though.
[positive]	[07:25]	<nexact>	vega-: /dev/hda is windows(I'll wipe it eventually ;})
[neutral]	[07:25]	<cables>	Madpilot, ah, makes sense.
[neutral]	[07:25]	<nexact>	vega-: so /dev/hda is (hd0) ?
[negative]	[07:25]	<Crypt>	well i do have an ATI card so i'm good on that end
[negative]	[07:25]	<vega->	nexact: should be on the drive that the bios is set to boot from
[negative]	[07:26]	<Jordan_U>	nexact, You should install to whatever drive you are set to boot from
[neutral]	[07:26]	<DaSkreech>	is there a PS3 Cd for Ubutnu?
[neutral]	[07:26]	<nexact>	vega-: ok, thanks.
[neutral]	[07:26]	<DaSkreech>	Ubuntu
[positive]	[07:26]	<k1gwb>	hey some people were saying upgrading in place would not work from edgy to feisty if a lot of third party stuff was installed....fwiw i've used easy ubuntu, automatix, beryl, lots of others on edgy and my in place upgrade was FLAWLESS and beautiful
[neutral]	[07:26]	<nexact>	I had an grub error 17 earlier...
[neutral]	[07:26]	<Jordan_U>	DaSkreech, I believe so
[positive]	[07:26]	<mjbrooks>	Madpilot, yeah, cause if ubotu had op powers it'd ban all of us and the channel would be empty  ;)
[positive]	[07:26]	<billy>	k1gwb, awesome!
[neutral]	[07:26]	<Flannel>	DaSkreech: that'd be PPC I believe.  There's probably a side-project somewhere
[negative]	[07:26]	<vega->	nexact: so if the first hd the bios tries is /dev/sda put it (grub i presume) there
[neutral]	[07:26]	<deCon>	klgwb, good to know! doing it right now!!!
[positive]	[07:26]	<Madpilot>	mjbrooks, something like that :)
[neutral]	[07:26]	<DaSkreech>	Jordan_U: Official?

[positive]	[07:30]	<WhiteNoise>	FWIW, in case it comes up - the latest update can be a bit tricky with cryptsetup and full root encryption -- I found it necessary to boot using old kernel, re-install cryptsetup, and run update-initramfs

[neutral]	[07:30]	<Crypt>	i'm on a ppc machine...powerbook
[negative]	[07:31]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	there has to be a ppc image
[neutral]	[07:31]	<bimberi>	DaSkreech: yes there is, it's under @HLINK but that's overloaded atm.  You might be able to find a mirror.
[neutral]	[07:31]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	I just saw it

[positive]	[07:31]	<Malachi>	rpedro: Thanks.
[neutral]	[07:31]	<DaSkreech>	You can't upgrade from dapper to feisty right?
[negative]	[07:32]	<k1gwb>	no you have to through edgy first
[positive]	[07:32]	<Madpilot>	DaSkreech, not without hitting Edgy first
[negative]	[07:32]	<DaSkreech>	ok
[positive]	[07:32]	<function1>	ok, i plan on using apt-cdrom to use my iso to upgrade to feisty. can i still use the simple gui upgrade to do this, or will i have to use apt-get dist-upgrade from the command line (ubuntu.com warned against this)
[neutral]	[07:32]	<DaSkreech>	cool
[neutral]	[07:32]	<letronje>	hi i have downloaded the fiesty iso, can i speed up my upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 using the iso image without burning a disc
[positive]	[07:32]	<DaSkreech>	but will you be able to go LTS -> LTS ?
[negative]	[07:32]	<Jordan_U>	Crypt, There is stuff that that page doesn't cover, let me try to find a more complete guide...
[negative]	[07:32]	<Jtkiefer>	ouch, that's going to suck for people who haven't upgraded from dapper
[neutral]	[07:32]	<DaSkreech>	or LTS +1 ?
[neutral]	[07:32]	<siti>	letronje: mount the iso?
[neutral]	[07:32]	<k1gwb>	you can mount the iso as a virtual cdrom
[negative]	[07:32]	<letronje>	and then ?
[negative]	[07:32]	<Jordan_U>	letronje, Only if you downloaded the alternate install CD
[neutral]	[07:32]	<Jtkiefer>	just doing a whole iso install to update is probably easy
[negative]	[07:32]	<letronje>	ok
[negative]	[07:33]	<bimberi>	letronje: was it the alternate?  you can't upgrade using the desktop cd
[positive]	[07:33]	<siti>	it was the desktop one ;)
[positive]	[07:33]	<Flannel>	Jordan_U, DaSkreech: no it's not.  Edgy supports PPC as well.
[neutral]	[07:33]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	is this the correct md5sum? e296e3468358789904097fc8df29609a  ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
[neutral]	[07:34]	<bimberi>	DaSkreech: i understand LTS -> LTS will be supported
[negative]	[07:34]	<megafauna>	Hi, how do I setup programs (like Firestarter) to automatically run when the computer boots?
[negative]	[07:34]	<k1gwb>	i went to ubuntu.com to donate but it said click the button and there was no button so i guess i get this version for free lol
[neutral]	[07:34]	<acidtabs>	S there streamTurner in ubuntu
[negative]	[07:34]	<DaSkreech>	bimberi: that should be interesting.
[positive]	[07:35]	<bimberi>	DaSkreech: very :)
[negative]	[07:35]	<petafile>	I get an error from sudo apt-get update in Feisty:  The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/htt could not be found.  ANy ideas?

[negative]	[07:36]	<function1>	so, is it safe to just mount the iso and run cdromupgrade?

[positive]	[08:23]	<drumline_>	Dell-Net: couple weeks sounds a bit long..   thanks though...    How long have you been using ubuntu?   Is it your primary box?
[negative]	[08:24]	<Ademan>	ExpositionOFEvil: maybe your burn was bad? because the torrent should check for data integrity

[negative]	[08:24]	<valermos>	Jordan_U, hmm... It was a while ago... But I think I used the xorg-driver-fglrx package from the repository... I'm pretty sure i added the restricted repository to my sources
[negative]	[08:24]	<Dell-Net>	drumline_: hmm yes it is using it for 1 year something
[neutral]	[08:24]	<deCon>	SeveredCross, that won't remove the packages it installed though, correct?

[neutral]	[08:26]	<john_>	can u bootcamp it
[positive]	[08:26]	<bytecolor>	this channel has a bit of velocity eh ;)
[neutral]	[08:26]	<mjallen>	i haven't tried that yet
[negative]	[08:26]	<Jordan_U>	john_, I use OSx but basically just for Final Cut Studio, if you don't do Video Editing / Graphics I would say go pure Ubuntu

[negative]	[08:27]	<drumline_>	mjallen: what's wrong with the boostrapping?
[negative]	[08:27]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	why does the image always have errors!
[neutral]	[08:27]	<valermos>	Jordan_U, @HLINK

[negative]	[08:28]	<mjallen>	the launch fails with this error: unable to locate RSDP
[negative]	[08:28]	<Tarkus>	siti, do i have to restart? or would logout/login work?
[neutral]	[08:28]	<zachwlewis>	Flannel: Last time I did that, it crashed.
[negative]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	yep
[neutral]	[08:28]	<Andy_242>	cheers- much in your debt, Eva!
[negative]	[08:28]	<mjallen>	it gets past that message then is just a blank screen
[neutral]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	the md5sum was correct
[negative]	[08:28]	<zachwlewis>	Like, I got stuck on that black restart screen.
[neutral]	[08:28]	<bytecolor>	ctrl+alt+backspace
[negative]	[08:28]	<Ademan>	ExpositionOFEvil: then it's your burner, try burning at a lower speed
[positive]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	k thanks
[negative]	[08:28]	<Flannel>	ExpositionOFEvil: burn at 4x
[negative]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	I was thinking the same thing
[neutral]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	my cd says 4x
[negative]	[08:28]	<ajax4>	ExpositionOFEvil: What about the md5sum of the cd after burning. Did you try that?
[negative]	[08:28]	<Whisperkiller>	ok im back now
[neutral]	[08:28]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	how to?
[negative]	[08:28]	<Flannel>	ExpositionOFEvil: make sure your burner says 4x
[neutral]	[08:28]	<Whisperkiller>	!grub
[positive]	[08:28]	<ubotu>	grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: @HLINK - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: @HLINK
[neutral]	[08:29]	<ajax4>	ExpositionOFEvil: I think its: md5sum /dev/cdrom

[neutral]	[08:29]	<Jordan_U>	valermos, That all looks fine, did you ever install the Drivers from ATi.com/
[neutral]	[08:29]	<ajax4>	ExpositionOFEvil: Lemme make sure
[neutral]	[08:29]	<Jordan_U>	?
[neutral]	[08:29]	<mjallen>	what is the equivalent of ctrl-alt-backspace on the mac keyboard?
[negative]	[08:29]	<matason>	Hirvinen, I mainly use Apache, PHP5, MySQL, Vim etc and I'm on Dapper LTS, are these packages available for Feisty? Or should I move to Edgy or just stick with Dapper?
[neutral]	[08:29]	<Jordan_U>	mjallen, ctrl+alt+delete
[neutral]	[08:29]	<matason>	Ooops
[negative]	[08:29]	<matason>	Sorry about the auto complete
[negative]	[08:30]	<Ademan>	ExpositionOFEvil: i always burn at 2x just to be safe because even though my burner says like 16x or something, i always get errors at that speed
[positive]	[08:30]	<Jordan_U>	mjallen, There is no real delete key on macs :)
[positive]	[08:30]	<Flannel>	matason: they are available on edgy, and feisty.  But theyre fine on dapper just the same.
[negative]	[08:30]	<zachwlewis>	Okay! More questions!
[neutral]	[08:30]	<mjallen>	jordan - thanks... nothing happened when i tried that so i was wondering if it were different
[neutral]	[08:30]	<zachwlewis>	Can I change my username?
[negative]	[08:30]	<matason>	Flannel: So is there much point in upgrading?
[negative]	[08:30]	<valermos>	Jordan_U, Yeah, as an alternative I followed a guide to install the ati-driver-installer-8.36.5-x86.x86_64.run package from ATI
[neutral]	[08:31]	<john_>	how big is the iso for you guys? ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
[positive]	[08:31]	<drumline_>	Kubuntu ISO @ 100k/s from a certain server that I wont mention right now.  :)   ...not bad.
[neutral]	[08:31]	<valermos>	Jordan_U, this is the guide i followed, method 2: @HLINK
[neutral]	[08:31]	<john_>	ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso 200MB
[neutral]	[08:31]	<john_>	is that right?
[neutral]	[08:31]	<Jordan_U>	valermos, What you did then may be interfering with the drivers from the repos.
[negative]	[08:31]	<Samuli^>	200MB? Can't be that small.
[neutral]	[08:31]	<ubuntu>	Flannel it won;'t work again
[positive]	[08:31]	<Ademan>	john_: i believe its 680 something
[neutral]	[08:31]	<versix>	has anyone else got proxy_balancer to work on apache under feisty/
[neutral]	[08:31]	<drumline_>	the image is around 690MB
[negative]	[08:31]	<Flannel>	john_: should be 696 or so
[negative]	[08:31]	<Ademan>	john_: it just barely fits on a cd
[negative]	[08:31]	<john_>	must have messed up
[neutral]	[08:32]	<Jordan_U>	valermos, Follow the uninstall instructions then try the repo drivers again
[negative]	[08:32]	<john_>	dam redownload :(
[positive]	[08:32]	<Darii>	Jordan_U: of course there is an delete key on macs
[neutral]	[08:32]	<Jordan_U>	Darii, Where?

[neutral]	[08:33]	<zachwlewis>	"Is there any way to apply some ""smooth text"" to the screen?"
[negative]	[08:33]	<Ademan>	john_: you should probably torrent anyways, it's easier on the servers, data checks it for you, etc
[positive]	[08:33]	<valermos>	Jordan_U, Alright I'll work on it... I'm about go go buy an nvidia card :) Thanks for your help. I might be back.
[neutral]	[08:33]	<Ademan>	!torrents

[neutral]	[08:33]	<Darii>	Jordan_U: an on portables u use fn+backspace
[negative]	[08:33]	<Ademan>	zachwlewis: uh truetype does anti-aliasing
[neutral]	[08:34]	<mjbrooks>	DumberDrummer, I believe flash and 64bit are not playing well currently
[neutral]	[08:34]	<zachwlewis>	My fonts and stuff still look... pixely.

[neutral]	[08:39]	<ubuntu>	yharrow_mobile: no
[negative]	[08:39]	<Flannel>	ubuntu: Oh.  You know why you might still need the internet to upgrade?  Because you've installed stuff from universe, which won't be on the CD
[neutral]	[08:40]	<derek_>	Hi
[positive]	[08:40]	<Crypt>	ajax4: odd. :-(
[positive]	[08:40]	<Jordan_U>	EvilDennisR, Because that will not do extra sanity checks when you upgrade and is not recommended
[positive]	[08:40]	<yharrow_mobile>	ubuntu: oh shucks, mark probably beat you to it :P
[positive]	[08:40]	<ajax4>	jb: Don't know, but probably alot smoother than my Pentium-3 :)

[negative]	[08:40]	<jb>	ajax4 lol probably.  I guess I'm a littler better off hehe
[negative]	[08:40]	<yharrow_mobile>	does anyone here know how to do an aspell dump of an entire dictionary?
[neutral]	[08:40]	<Jordan_U>	EvilDennisR, Ubuntu is not Debian
[positive]	[08:40]	<ajax4>	Crypt: I think the Kubuntu team is a little behind the main Ubunutu team.
[negative]	[08:40]	<ubuntu>	Flannel: and is there some method to remove then
[neutral]	[08:40]	<ajax4>	!kubuntu
[positive]	[08:40]	<ubotu>	Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See @HLINK for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE

[negative]	[08:41]	<EvilDennisR>	Jordan_U: Which is why I asked you why I can't edit sources.list directly.. and you answered my question.. I'll have to upgrade tomorrow when I'm at work
[positive]	[08:41]	<ajax4>	Crypt: np :)
[negative]	[08:41]	<noiesmo>	gr3ml1n, but you must be carefull you can damage monitor
[neutral]	[08:41]	<gr3ml1n>	where?
[negative]	[08:41]	<Flannel>	ubuntu: well, sure... you'd have to remove all the packages you've installed from universe though.
[neutral]	[08:41]	<noiesmo>	gr3ml1n, @HLINK
[negative]	[08:41]	<ajax4>	ExpositionOFEvil: Has to check the whole disc...might take a few mins.

[negative]	[08:42]	<Flannel>	ubuntu: synaptic might be the easiest method.  Why are you so worrid about not downloading from the internet?
[negative]	[08:42]	<yharrow_mobile>	wow, 1027 members. is that a record high?
[neutral]	[08:42]	<Flannel>	yharrow_mobile: We topped 1500 overnight
[negative]	[08:42]	<Jordan_U>	desmond, Do you want beryl specifically or just wobbly windows, desktop cube etc?
[neutral]	[08:42]	<mjbrooks>	!beryl | desmond

[negative]	[09:05]	<Madpilot>	mneptok, yeah, but pulling one .torrent file off isn't the same as dragging the entire ISO off..

[negative]	[09:06]	<Madpilot>	mneptok, really? Went to grab the alt CD torrent a while ago, that URL I gave came up fine. Not fast, but didn't take 3min.
[neutral]	[09:06]	<YogSothoth>	Hi!
[negative]	[09:06]	<Geoffrey2>	well, Feisty is up and running over here....now I just need to figure out why I can get audio but no video from VLC

[negative]	[09:07]	<Cactii>	I want to upgrade using the LiveCD rather than over the internet... is that a problem???
[negative]	[09:07]	<mneptok>	Madpilot: OSUOSL and PDX.edu are drowning. probably better to point people at montreal for .torrent files
[positive]	[09:07]	<YogSothoth>	I just downloaded xubuntu 7.04. I already run ubuntu but want a fresh clean install. Can I run the installed directly from my current ubuntu, from the mounted ISO, without burning it?
[neutral]	[09:07]	<mneptok>	Cactii: you need the alt CD
[negative]	[09:07]	<siti>	Geoffrey2: audio works fine for me in vlc, I wonder what the issue is...
[neutral]	[09:07]	<jussi01>	andy_, you can grab gdesklets - it may have something your after
[negative]	[09:07]	<Madpilot>	mneptok, fair enough. at least torrents just get faster when they're busier, not slower...

[neutral]	[09:47]	<Amaranth>	T0uCH: In edgy you can use the 8776 driver (which works fine) and in feisty you can use either one of those 9xxx drivers
[neutral]	[09:47]	<mjbrooks>	jussi01, close enough for rocket science
[neutral]	[09:47]	<Erebus>	Will this new version (7.04) fix my kernel panic problem?
[positive]	[09:47]	<jussi01>	:D
[negative]	[09:48]	<eck>	chr_: i would normally use gparted

[negative]	[09:48]	<ferret_0568>	Not sure Erebus, like Amaranth said, it might

[negative]	[09:49]	<ajax4>	tristanmike: Try a bunch of different video files, if some play and others don't its most likely a codec issue. I can't really offer any more help than that.
[positive]	[09:49]	<ATi7500>	hi all :)

[negative]	[09:49]	<what_if>	anyone had problems with the desktop install with Nvidia ?? edgy never worked for me :(

[neutral]	[09:49]	<odix>	bahh
[neutral]	[09:49]	<ubotu>	TOuCH: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:49]	<magnetron>	what_if: works like a charm for me, better than edgy
[negative]	[09:49]	<ossm>	Hi, I tried to upgrade my laptop at home to Feisty but it won't upgrade. I have a problem with the update manager not going away and packages not being able to be installed. A message comes up saying a distribution upgrade needs to be done to 6.10 but this doesn't seem to work. The upgrade to Feisty seems to take ages on the first stage and then just comes up with errors? Could anyone help?
[negative]	[09:50]	<odix>	is the upgrade server bogged down or is it me ?
[negative]	[09:50]	<gharz>	hi, guys.... i have upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04. now the final release is available... do i need to make some update? i did update-manager -d and nothing is avail. thanks
[negative]	[09:50]	<ferret_0568>	Oh, in Feisty they have nvidia-glx-new?
[neutral]	[09:50]	<odix>	im on a 10mb line and g etting 14kbsec
[neutral]	[09:50]	<mjbrooks>	!slow > odix
[neutral]	[09:50]	<ATi7500>	someone with a good networking knowledge could join #ATi7500 please?
[negative]	[09:50]	<what_if>	magnetron: my card does not work with the NV driver... just random colors :(
[negative]	[09:50]	<Danrarbc>	yes the servers are getting hit hard
[neutral]	[09:50]	<Amaranth>	T0uCH: Just install the nvidia-glx package in adept then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and tell it to use the nvidia driver
[negative]	[09:50]	<ajax4>	chr_: That's odd. I've never experienced that problem.
[positive]	[09:50]	<Amaranth>	T0uCH: then restart and it should all work
[neutral]	[09:50]	<magnetron>	!final > gharz
[positive]	[09:50]	<Danrarbc>	the full release isos are also on most of those servers
[neutral]	[09:50]	<ajax4>	tristanmike: Hang on.
[negative]	[09:50]	<ferret_0568>	ok, how do I remove NVIDIA's official (from their website) module?
[negative]	[09:50]	<Amaranth>	ferret_0568: Yeah, nvidia-glx-new is the 9755 driver
[negative]	[09:50]	<ferret_0568>	I have a GeForce 4
[negative]	[09:51]	<ferret_0568>	Is it gonna work?
[positive]	[09:51]	<Amaranth>	ferret_0568: the .run file can take an uninstall command
[positive]	[09:51]	<odix>	so now that ive started i cant stop this update ?
[positive]	[09:51]	<gharz>	magnetron, thanks!
[negative]	[09:51]	<T0uCH>	which line i need to use to tell it to use the nvidia.. cause i tried this yesterday and it crashed the x sessions
[neutral]	[09:51]	<magnetron>	what_if: which card do you have?
[neutral]	[09:51]	<noiesmo>	tristanmike, in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins are there libtotem files
[negative]	[09:51]	<Amaranth>	ferret_0568: no, for a geforce 4 you want the nvidia-glx package, that is 9631
[neutral]	[09:51]	<ferret_0568>	odix; yup
[neutral]	[09:51]	<what_if>	magnetron: 7800
[neutral]	[09:51]	<ferret_0568>	I already have that one
[neutral]	[09:51]	<tristanmike>	noiesmo: ...checking....
[neutral]	[09:51]	<noiesmo>	tristanmike, i take it you have mozilla-mplayer installed
[neutral]	[09:51]	<what_if>	magnetron: an eVGA
[neutral]	[09:51]	<tristanmike>	noiesmo: yessir
[negative]	[09:51]	<Amaranth>	odix: If you're just downloading you can stop it and resume where you left off later
[negative]	[09:51]	<odix>	ferret? uhh? so if i rebooted now all would be lost? I'd rather d/l an iso and update from that
[negative]	[09:51]	<ferret_0568>	But, I know the benefits
[negative]	[09:51]	<Amaranth>	odix: If it's already installing things you can't stop it
[negative]	[09:52]	<magnetron>	what_if: it's not a SLI, is it?
[negative]	[09:52]	<chr_>	eck: I started by following the instructions on this site @HLINK and after I ran ntfsresize, this was the msg. I got @HLINK Is this not a standard part of the process?
[neutral]	[09:52]	<odix>	its stil fetching
[negative]	[09:52]	<Amaranth>	odix: Then you can stop it
[negative]	[09:52]	<what_if>	magnetron: no, but I wish... \
[neutral]	[09:52]	<odix>	cool
[neutral]	[09:52]	<ATi7500>	someone with a good networking knowledge could join #ATi7500 please?
[negative]	[09:52]	<ajax4>	tristanmike: Sorry man, pretty much out of ideas on your problem.
[negative]	[09:52]	<Amaranth>	odix: But you'll want the alternative CD if you plan to use it to upgrade
[negative]	[09:52]	<tarelerulz>	I have win32 package for mplayer from their site . SO I don't see why it will not work
[neutral]	[09:52]	<bayziders>	Wow fiesty has compiz built in O_O
[positive]	[09:52]	<bayziders>	Epic win
[neutral]	[09:52]	<Amaranth>	odix: the Desktop CD can only do new installs
[negative]	[09:52]	<ferret_0568>	if it has no stop button, odix
[neutral]	[09:52]	<odix>	amaranth, good info
[neutral]	[09:52]	<tristanmike>	noiesmo: I see both libtotem and mplayer plugin related .so and .xpt files
[positive]	[09:52]	<Amaranth>	bayziders: Yeah, it's awesome :)
[neutral]	[09:52]	<odix>	i used force quit
[negative]	[09:52]	<ferret_0568>	ok
[negative]	[09:53]	<tarelerulz>	it says I have some kind of seeking problem and the file that is is looking for is not there in the win32 dir
[neutral]	[09:53]	<bayziders>	Compiz is nice, im used to beryl thou.
[neutral]	[09:53]	<magnetron>	what_if: well, can you install the restricted nvidia drivers after the Feisty install?
[positive]	[09:53]	<tristanmike>	ajax4: I always appreciate the help, thank you :D
[neutral]	[09:53]	<ferret_0568>	a word of caution, it changed your software sources
[positive]	[09:53]	<bayziders>	But it's built in great for new users
[negative]	[09:53]	<noiesmo>	tristanmike, ok totem is clashing with mozilla-mplayer there are two things you can do 1 remove totem-mozilla and then reinstall mozilla-mplayer or two just remove the libtotem* files and re install mozilla-mplayer
[negative]	[09:53]	<Danrarbc>	speaking of Compiz any way to have it allow rotating the cube using the middle mouse button? I'm just using Beryl cause I like that
[positive]	[09:53]	<Amaranth>	bayziders: beryl is no more :)
[negative]	[09:53]	<Danrarbc>	then again Beryl isn't unstable for me now
[negative]	[09:53]	<what_if>	magnetron: shure I can, but the installer is just rendom colors blinking...
[negative]	[09:53]	<eck>	chr_: gparted is a script on top of ntfsresize and fdisk, and since it does the error checking that is why it is recommended
[negative]	[09:53]	<ap1>	How do I debug USB issues? Memory sticks? Hard disks? Good WIki pointer?
[positive]	[09:53]	<tristanmike>	noiesmo: I'll try the former and if that don't work, I'm nuking the files :P
[neutral]	[09:53]	<Amaranth>	Danrarbc: That'd require a patch to the rotate plugin (so no, you can't do that)
[negative]	[09:53]	<bayziders>	Amaranth: But this has like half the features.
[positive]	[09:53]	<what_if>	magnetron: so getting to that point is a little rough
[negative]	[09:53]	<Danrarbc>	alright
[negative]	[09:53]	<odix>	"hey i got a brainteaser, i run a wireless router on a 6mb line and on my wireless laptops i get over 1mbsec d/l and fast loading times, my direct computer is ubuntu, when i go to a webpage it sits there for like 30 seconds saying looking up ""X"""

[negative]	[09:54]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[09:54]	<Amaranth>	bayziders: You're probably looking for compiz-extra and gnome-compiz-manager
[positive]	[09:54]	<odix>	but on my windows laptops awesome speed
[negative]	[09:54]	<noiesmo>	tristanmike, sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla && sudo apt-get install --reinstall mozilla-mplayer
[negative]	[09:54]	<Danrarbc>	I figured as much cause i didn't see it in gconf

[neutral]	[09:54]	<Amaranth>	gharz: there won't be anymore beryl releases

[neutral]	[09:55]	<ATi7500>	odix: i am in that setup
[negative]	[09:55]	<what_if>	magnetron: hmmm.... I'll just alt-install
[positive]	[09:55]	<Amaranth>	gharz: No, beryl will still work fine for 7.04
[neutral]	[09:55]	<ferret_0568>	Amaranth, there's a special IRC mode to disable that
[neutral]	[09:55]	<ferret_0568>	I forgot what though
[positive]	[09:55]	<Amaranth>	ferret_0568: I don't want to disable that, too much spam :)

[positive]	[10:48]	<Hegge>	gnomefreak : oki.. well i have red the link, the question is: has it changed in the new rel and they havent had time to change the information on the homepage
[neutral]	[10:48]	<jussi01>	Thor, did you report a bug?
[negative]	[10:48]	<Thor>	gnomefreak: It's running a recovery now, I didn't take a copy of the specific error message, what files should I dump in the bug report?
[neutral]	[10:48]	<gnomefreak>	Hegge: yes
[negative]	[10:49]	<Trist_an>	gerry_, so I don't understand your question
[neutral]	[10:49]	<Dell-Net>	i have nvidia beryl + aiglx works like a charm

[positive]	[10:49]	<Hegge>	thanks gnomefreak
[neutral]	[10:49]	<bayziders>	O_O it completly locks up my system.
[negative]	[10:49]	<Trist_an>	gerry_, unless if you want to know if you can have Beryl/Compiz without Xgl on ATI. I think it is not possible
[negative]	[10:49]	<Thor>	jussi: no, but I'm about to.
[negative]	[10:49]	<bayziders>	and does nothing
[neutral]	[10:49]	<gnomefreak>	thepumpkin1979: /var/log/dist-upgrade

[neutral]	[10:51]	<Hairulfr>	gerry_: It already is
[neutral]	[10:51]	<jhaig>	Dell-Net: I think Dia is another.
[neutral]	[10:51]	<babo>	is feisty stable released ?
[negative]	[10:51]	<cables>	gerry_, first it'll prompt you to install the drivers, then you'll need to reboot, then you can enable the effects.
[positive]	[10:51]	<babo>	thanks btw :-)

[positive]	[10:52]	<babo>	:-) ... what are the chances of it getting my laptop microphone to work ? And/or clearing up my touchpad issues ?
[neutral]	[10:52]	<cables>	gerry_, do you have the drivers installed? Go to System>Administration>Restricted Drivers Manager to check.
[negative]	[10:52]	<Trist_an>	Why Compiz by default and not Beryl?

[neutral]	[10:53]	<babo>	feisty that is ...

[neutral]	[10:53]	<Kakurady>	I see that now. - I've got Beryl and XGL installed with my system. Do I need to uninstall them before I do a dist-upgrade?

[neutral]	[10:54]	<flamebird>	I dont get it
[negative]	[10:54]	<Trist_an>	babo, I'm not under Feisty yet but I was told it is the best way
[negative]	[10:54]	<shwag>	because the beryl wiki says to do other stuff.
[negative]	[10:54]	<Hairulfr>	jussi01: Now it let me select langauge, and then disapperede... Got further with wine....
[negative]	[10:54]	<gerry_>	cables:  compiz not work out of box even i have installed fglrx drivers
[negative]	[10:54]	<cables>	shwag, on feisty you just need to make sure your video drivers are installed and apt-get install beryl
[negative]	[10:54]	<slackern>	Is there anyone here using a X1950 card and got some form of better performance than the regular vesa drivers? I've tried about every driver out there both from repos and made them from ati.com but they all perform worse than vesa.
[negative]	[10:54]	<flamebird>	Ubuntu was released but then I use the update manager it says my system is up to date!!!!
[negative]	[10:54]	<shwag>	cables: should I not enable Desktop Effects (..uhmm..compiz?)  if im just going to do beryl ?
[negative]	[10:54]	<flamebird>	any ideas!
[negative]	[10:54]	<enry>	ok the cube is not working
[negative]	[10:54]	<darkhack>	In beryl, when I made my buttom panel transparent with alt + mouse scroll, but when restarting the pc, it went back to normal. So, is there a way to save the trasparent panel in beryl?
[neutral]	[10:54]	<Hairulfr>	enry: Did you enable it?
[negative]	[10:54]	<cables>	shwag, you can if you want... but disable them before you install beryl
[negative]	[10:55]	<shwag>	cables: I wonder why the beryl wiki doesnt explain you can just apt-get it now by default.
[negative]	[10:55]	<flamebird>	enry, open gconf editor and make the desktop to 4
[negative]	[10:55]	<enry>	Hairulfr, it worked only for 5 minutes
[negative]	[10:55]	<danikhan>	whats the default kernel version in fiesty
[neutral]	[10:55]	<shwag>	cables: cool.

[neutral]	[11:02]	<magnetron>	enry: use gconf-editor to edit /apps/compiz/general/screen0/options, hsize =4
[negative]	[11:02]	<Thor>	was it a bad idea of me to use Envy to install nVidia drivers?
[neutral]	[11:02]	<gnomefreak>	yw
[negative]	[11:02]	<Thor>	should I remove those and try again?
[positive]	[11:02]	<ikonia_>	T0uCH you will lose your boot sector
[negative]	[11:02]	<Thor>	Envy was the only simple option i found for Edgy.
[neutral]	[11:02]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:second, kernel ramdonly freezes with error output:ata1:failed to respond(30secs Status 0xd0)
[neutral]	[11:02]	<gnomefreak>	Thor: yes
[negative]	[11:02]	<TommyTom>	ikonia_: i have no idea. all i know is i have a raid already setup. i used DMRAID to recognize it. i tried formating in the installer app and from windows and neither work. get same error since the installer forces me to format
[neutral]	[11:03]	<ikonia_>	"jenda I think there is an option within ""lndir"""
[negative]	[11:03]	<T0uCH>	ok
[negative]	[11:03]	<Thor>	gnomefreak: does Feisty install those same drivers for me without me having to mess about with tools like that?
[negative]	[11:03]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:no ,kernel detects my sound card right, on the screen it looks right
[negative]	[11:03]	<darkhack>	so, there's no way to save my trasparent panel in beryl mode???
[negative]	[11:03]	<ikonia_>	TommyTom my personal opinion is that dmraid is not a good call
[negative]	[11:03]	<Zer0>	any idea when the stable version of feisty is coming to the automatic updater (for us still running the beta)?
[negative]	[11:03]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:the only question is that no sound is out
[neutral]	[11:03]	<gnomefreak>	Thor: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx depending on your card
[negative]	[11:03]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 I doubt thats a kernel issue to be honest
[negative]	[11:03]	<Hairulfr>	drakhack: What do you mean? The panel can be transparent
[negative]	[11:03]	<slackern>	Zer0, you probably have it already if you keep yourself updated
[neutral]	[11:04]	<Zer0>	oh, thanks, hehe
[neutral]	[11:04]	<Dreamless>	Zer0 it does
[positive]	[11:04]	<gnomefreak>	Thor: is taht easy enough?
[negative]	[11:04]	<Zer0>	how do i check?
[negative]	[11:04]	<seamus7>	Hi... I want to use Network Manager but it's not currently showing up in my notification area ... How do I go about getting it to automatically activate upon boot?
[neutral]	[11:04]	<gnomefreak>	that*
[neutral]	[11:04]	<copper>	hi
[positive]	[11:04]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:but my sound card works fine when i use 2.0.20-13-generic
[positive]	[11:04]	<Dreamless>	Zer0 system -> administration -> upgrade manager (or something im on danish feisty here)
[negative]	[11:04]	<Thor>	gnomefreak: i could actually go through hours of compiling libraries and such, but I'm a fan of convenience.
[negative]	[11:04]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron,  rightclick and override which version to use this idea did not work, wht it is difficult to install openoffice from CD
[negative]	[11:04]	<TommyTom>	"ikonia_ what do you suggest then. i finally got it to ""work"" with dmraid. and it seemed easy enough. and im completely nub to linux"
[negative]	[11:04]	<Sandwalker>	Has anyone got Microsoft TrueType fonts working in Feisty?  If so, how?
[negative]	[11:04]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 are you using fesity
[neutral]	[11:04]	<Thor>	gnomefreak: (I'm a programmer myself)
[positive]	[11:05]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:yes ,with final release
[negative]	[11:05]	<Analemma23>	Hey, what's the best ubuntu irc client???
[neutral]	[11:05]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_:fresh installed
[negative]	[11:05]	<magnetron>	"Bhaskar1: what do you mean ""it did not work""?"
[negative]	[11:05]	<BalchD>	Hi, is there a MD5 checksum or similar I can get to verify my Fiesty ISO is ok?
[negative]	[11:05]	<ikonia_>	TommyTom I would suggest using software raid, and not using lvm for your root file systems
[neutral]	[11:05]	<knoppix>	cineva care intelege ro?
[neutral]	[11:05]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 log a bug then
[negative]	[11:05]	<copper>	any idea why my IDE drive suddently got handled by a scsi driver when upgrading to ubuntu on one laptop, but not on another laptop?
[positive]	[11:05]	<magnetron>	!best > Analemma23
[negative]	[11:05]	<Zer0>	i meant if i could see the version number of the current build or something, i get the updates whenever they come up
[neutral]	[11:05]	<slackern>	Analemma23, nice nick
[neutral]	[11:05]	<copper>	drives actually
[negative]	[11:05]	<shwag>	cables: where is beryl-manager ?
[positive]	[11:05]	<jhaig>	Analemma23: Define 'best'.  :-)  A lot of people use Gaim, I think, because it is installed by default.
[positive]	[11:05]	<seamus7>	BalchD: K3B will do that automatically ... but you do need to download the md5sum to check it against
[neutral]	[11:05]	<ikonia_>	copper libata now recognises all hard disks through the ata library as scsi
[negative]	[11:05]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, not work
[neutral]	[11:05]	<Hairulfr>	copper: It's probably ide on on and sata on the other. My sata is handled by scsi
[negative]	[11:05]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_: i want to report bug at first,but someone did it already
[negative]	[11:06]	<TommyTom>	ikonia_: from what i understand though, software raid i would have to wipe the whole array. i can do that. 400gb gone :(
[negative]	[11:06]	<slackern>	Analemma23, i prefer xchat myself, some like irssi, bitchx etc etc
[neutral]	[11:06]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 update the bug with your input then
[neutral]	[11:06]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, it aslo search for internet
[positive]	[11:06]	<copper>	Hairulfr: those are both old laptops, both IDE only
[neutral]	[11:06]	<TommyTom>	cant*
[negative]	[11:06]	<darkhack>	<Hairulfr> I meant when I'm running beryl and I use a+mouse scroll to make my panel transparent, but when restart pc, it went back to normal. I'm not tlaking about the transparent from panel property.
[neutral]	[11:06]	<ikonia_>	TommyTom backup
[negative]	[11:06]	<BalchD>	seamus7: I don't know where to get the MD5...
[negative]	[11:06]	<magnetron>	Bhaskar1: that's all the support i can give
[neutral]	[11:06]	<knoppix>	hello
[negative]	[11:06]	<cables>	shwag, what do you mean by where?
[neutral]	[11:06]	<ikonia_>	TommyTom or use dmraid with iout lvm
[neutral]	[11:06]	<cables>	!md5 | BalchD
[neutral]	[11:06]	<ubotu>	BalchD: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see @HLINK or @HLINK
[negative]	[11:06]	<tomix>	upgrade or re-install for version 7? does it really make any difference?
[negative]	[11:06]	<shwag>	cables: it didnt get installed i guess.  I just did  apt-get install beryl
[neutral]	[11:06]	<darkhack>	<Hairulfr> alt+mouse scroll I meant
[neutral]	[11:06]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_: actually i solved the sound bug, by compiling alsa driver and alsa lib myself
[neutral]	[11:06]	<cables>	shwag, just hit alt-f2 and run it.
[neutral]	[11:06]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, have u ever install from CD?
[negative]	[11:06]	<TommyTom>	ikonia_: i would if i even knew what LVM was
[negative]	[11:06]	<Hairulfr>	darkhack: Ok, you need to set a specific value for the panel in beryl-settings manager. Give me a sec
[negative]	[11:07]	<cables>	shwag, it installed it for me... hmm.
[negative]	[11:07]	<cables>	shwag, there's an ubuntu-beryl package you should install too.
[neutral]	[11:07]	<magnetron>	Bhaskar1: yes
[negative]	[11:07]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 so report that into the bug report, the problem is not the kernel but the alsa interface
[positive]	[11:07]	<hagabaka>	with the new version of xorg-driver-fglrx in Feisty, is it required to blacklist the fglrx module?
[positive]	[11:07]	<seamus7>	BalchD: the ubuntu download page will have a list somewhere of all available downloads including the MD5SUM for each ...
[neutral]	[11:07]	<Analemma23>	Thanks guys, I am trying xchat, didn't know gaim did irc as well.
[negative]	[11:07]	<copper>	ikonia_: any idea why my drives are still handled as IDE on my other laptop?
[negative]	[11:07]	<cables>	Analemma23, it doesn't do it well. Gaim's IRC is really nasty.
[positive]	[11:07]	<ikonia_>	copper different version of ubuntu
[neutral]	[11:07]	<copper>	ikonia_: same
[positive]	[11:07]	<copper>	both feisty
[neutral]	[11:08]	<ikonia_>	copper which version ?
[negative]	[11:08]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, why not working so
[neutral]	[11:08]	<copper>	latest
[negative]	[11:08]	<magnetron>	Bhaskar1: you tell me
[negative]	[11:08]	<tomix>	upgrade or re-install for version 7? does it really make any difference?
[neutral]	[11:08]	<BalchD>	Ah, got it now, thanks seamus7 & cables!
[negative]	[11:08]	<ikonia_>	copper thats very strange, what type of disks are in the the none scsi machine
[negative]	[11:08]	<Hairulfr>	darkhack: Go to Window Management>Set windows attrib by various criteria> grab you just pick the panel and the set the opacity
[negative]	[11:08]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_: ok, how about the ata1 error? it makes kernel freeze about 30secs
[neutral]	[11:08]	<ikonia_>	tomix do it and tell us
[neutral]	[11:08]	<copper>	ikonia_: normal IDE drives
[neutral]	[11:08]	<shwag>	"is it normal that im getting all these apt-get errors about  ""packages cannot be authenticated!""  ?"
[negative]	[11:08]	<hobe>	So there is no known problem with the ADSL modem from Alcatel?
[positive]	[11:08]	<jimcooncat>	need a simple iso burning app, have a borked xubuntu dapper right now
[neutral]	[11:08]	<TommyTom>	!lvm
[positive]	[11:08]	<ubotu>	Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on @HLINK and @HLINK
[negative]	[11:08]	<ikonia_>	copper and your sure its your harddisk that showing like that - and not a cdrom
[negative]	[11:08]	<Analemma23>	cables thanks, I'm just wanting to shunt the joins and quits to a different window... then I think xchat would be ok for me...
[negative]	[11:09]	<Hairulfr>	darkhack: Grab using window type (select in the box to the left)
[negative]	[11:09]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 looks like a driver error - again log a bug report
[positive]	[11:09]	<copper>	ikonia_: both the hard drive and the DVD-ROM drive are handled as IDE
[neutral]	[11:09]	<cables>	does anyone know if libpam-keyring needs any setup further than just installing the package?
[neutral]	[11:09]	<copper>	/dev/hda and /dev/hdc
[positive]	[11:09]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_: i compiled the original 2.6.20 from kernel.org, problem still remains
[positive]	[11:09]	<ikonia_>	copper where they both clean fesity installsor updates
[negative]	[11:10]	<K^Holtz>	if i wanted to do something like only allowing a certain type of traffic from a specific IP, and block all others... would i first write the iptables rule that allows from the specified ip, then write a block all rule for that traffic under it? or would the block all rule just overshadow the allow rule i wrote above it?
[positive]	[11:10]	<vimalg2>	Can anyone tell me if there is a command-line switch or some hack/workaround that allows APT-GET to resume broken downloads? I cannot stress this enough because my ISP only provides dial-up in my area. I've been trying to download Eclipse from the repositories for a very long time. Please help!
[neutral]	[11:10]	<copper>	ikonia_: yes
[neutral]	[11:10]	<spikeb>	jimcooncat, gnomebaker will do it
[neutral]	[11:10]	<Hairulfr>	darkhack: Got it working?
[neutral]	[11:10]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 thats because ubuntu uses the same kernel as kernel.org so if there is a driver error in that kernel - it will still be in that kernel if you build it your self
[positive]	[11:10]	<ikonia_>	copper I'm doing some investigation, thats very unusual from what I'd expect
[negative]	[11:10]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, i am in trouble from 2 days, that i could not install from CD , to install openoffice only from CD
[positive]	[11:11]	<copper>	ikonia_: actually, the difference is that on the first laptop, the one where drives are recognized as scsi drives, was first upgraded to the latest beta of feisty
[positive]	[11:11]	<cables>	vimalg2, you can find out what packages eclipse needs, then download them from packages.ubuntu.com with a download manager that can resume downloads.
[positive]	[11:11]	<ikonia_>	copper you said they where both clean installs of fesity
[neutral]	[11:11]	<legs11>	hi all
[neutral]	[11:11]	<magnetron>	Bhaskar1: maybe you could find an internet connection and download the packet
[negative]	[11:11]	<stiffme1983>	ikonia_: actually at first, i thought the ata1 problem is caused by ubuntu patch to kernel
[positive]	[11:11]	<copper>	ikonia_: ikonia_ clean upgrades, yes
[neutral]	[11:11]	<seamus7>	Hello... will deleting the contents of /etc/network/interfaces allow Network Manager to activate on reboot? It's currently not showing up in the notification area.
[negative]	[11:11]	<ikonia_>	stiffme1983 I'm not aware of any ata patches
[positive]	[11:11]	<ikonia_>	copper clean upgrades ???
[neutral]	[11:11]	<ikonia_>	copper how was both installed
[positive]	[11:12]	<jimcooncat>	thanks spikeb
[neutral]	[11:12]	<copper>	ikonia_: the first one, edgy 6.10 -> feisty beta -> feisty
[negative]	[11:12]	<vimalg2>	cables: Is there any proxy or something i could install locally to cache partial downloads/requests from apt-get?
[negative]	[11:12]	<arooni>	how can i uninstalle eclipse?
[neutral]	[11:12]	<copper>	ikonia_: the second one, edgy 6.10 -> feisty
[neutral]	[11:12]	<ikonia_>	copper and the second
[negative]	[11:12]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, i want to install offline, from CD
[negative]	[11:12]	<cables>	vimalg2, i'm not sure, sorry...
[negative]	[11:12]	<copper>	"I clicked on the ""upgrade"" button like anyone else"
[positive]	[11:12]	<foug>	7.04 is very good guys! no problems so far, and most problems I had in 6.10 are now fixed with Feisty. If you havn't upgraded I suggest you do. If you're a dev, thanks for making a good os
[neutral]	[11:12]	<cables>	Bhaskar1, the CD has OpenOffice built into it.
[negative]	[11:12]	<ikonia_>	copper ok - the atabranch that handles scsi ---> ide conversion may have been removed int he beta, I don't know at this moment int time I'll have to check when I get home
[negative]	[11:12]	<steven43126>	vimalg2, and webproxy should do and make sure you use http sources
[neutral]	[11:13]	<cables>	Bhaskar1, when you install Ubuntu from the CD, it has OpenOffice installed already.
[negative]	[11:13]	<Amec>	When I try to upgrade to Feisty, it stops at fetching file 108 of 114, then after a few mins, it continues then gives me and error then crashes. Can anyone help me with this please?
[neutral]	[11:13]	<copper>	ikonia_: it's the other way around
[neutral]	[11:13]	<ikonia_>	copper that should read - been removed in the stable release
[neutral]	[11:13]	<Hairulfr>	Amec: What is the error ?
[positive]	[11:13]	<copper>	the laptop that was first upgraded to the beta is the one that's handled as scsi
[negative]	[11:13]	<ikonia_>	copper I've just corrected myself
[positive]	[11:13]	<slackern>	Amec, it could be that the servers are a bit overloaded right now
[negative]	[11:13]	<copper>	ikonia_: ah ok
[negative]	[11:13]	<Amec>	I don't know, I'm trying for the 4th time... I'll tell you when it returns the error.
[positive]	[11:13]	<Bhaskar1>	cables, ya ,but i uninstall office once a time, so i want to install it again
[negative]	[11:14]	<ikonia_>	copper there was a serious kernel error just days before release - that may have been one of the issues, I don't know off the top of my head, I'll have to investigate when I get home
[negative]	[11:14]	<compengi>	how can i get static ip configuration work on Feisty?
[neutral]	[11:14]	<ikonia_>	compengi use the network configuration gui and set one
[positive]	[11:14]	<copper>	ikonia_: ok, thanks :)
[neutral]	[11:14]	<magnetron>	!guidelines | Bhaskar1
[negative]	[11:14]	<richard-blaine>	hello guys, any pointer as to where to get MD5SUM of the DVD iso (7.04)
[positive]	[11:14]	<ubotu>	Bhaskar1: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also @HLINK
[positive]	[11:14]	<copper>	WAY too many people in this chan :-/
[neutral]	[11:14]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine on the ubutnu download sites
[negative]	[11:14]	<compengi>	ikonia, i don't have internet when i setup that
[neutral]	[11:14]	<magnetron>	!repeat > Bhaskar1
[negative]	[11:14]	<ikonia_>	compengi thats because you can't set static IP's - your ISP has to set you one
[negative]	[11:15]	<ytsestef>	Amarok says there's no mp3 support, asks me too install, then locks up and I have to kill it... can I do anything?
[negative]	[11:15]	<Thor>	hehe, there should be load balancing for #ubuntu, like, you'd get redirected to one of several rooms.
[negative]	[11:15]	<gustavo>	hi! how do i prevent kernel panic happening when compiling a kernel?
[negative]	[11:15]	<pukkie>	ques, is there somewhere I can find the differences between server and desktop? The installers on the CD's are different and such, but what's actually different for the rest? do they use different repositories/start up scripts/etc?
[neutral]	[11:15]	<Bhaskar1>	magnetron, so
[neutral]	[11:15]	<ikonia_>	gustavo you learn how to build a kerenl ?
[negative]	[11:15]	<compengi>	ikonia, nope that's not the issue, i got a router. and on edgy it works fine but on feisty no
[negative]	[11:15]	<Thor>	gustavo: that should not happen, basically.
[negative]	[11:16]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia : i cant seem to find any mentioning about dvd iso on the download site (or maybe i didnt look hard)
[negative]	[11:16]	<slackern>	ytsestef, i read about it yesterday if you are in KDE it will download the correct codecs but you can also install the codec packages manually but im not sure about the names of them =/
[negative]	[11:16]	<hagabaka>	on @HLINK , in the Method 2 section there's a paragraph about blacklisting the fglrx module, but it says it's only needed with Method 1. is that a typo?
[negative]	[11:16]	<Thor>	gustavo: I guess something's awry in your currently running kernel, but I doubt it's related to compiling the new kernel.
[neutral]	[11:16]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine you didn't look hard
[neutral]	[11:16]	<ikonia_>	Thor I think he means a panic in the one he's trying to build, not the running kernel
[negative]	[11:16]	<darkhack>	<Hairulfr> sorry it took me long to respond, but how do I set the buttom panel.
[neutral]	[11:16]	<ikonia_>	thor when he boots fromt he one he's built
[neutral]	[11:16]	<THJ>	ikonia: lol
[neutral]	[11:16]	<THJ>	ikonia: that might be it
[neutral]	[11:16]	<T0uCH>	does anybody knows how to unload the xorg because of overwrite possibility due to customize configuration?
[negative]	[11:17]	<ikonia_>	T0uCH I have no idea what you mean by that question
[neutral]	[11:17]	<gustavo>	Thor: ive compiled a kernel, but it does not boot, because of kernel panic...
[negative]	[11:17]	<cables>	!fr | T0uCH, maybe there's someone in here that could help
[neutral]	[11:17]	<orbin>	!server > pukkie  (see PM from ubotu)
[negative]	[11:17]	<ubotu>	T0uCH, maybe there's someone in here that could help: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[negative]	[11:17]	<ikonia_>	gustavo in that case you need to lean how to build kernels properly
[positive]	[11:18]	<gustavo>	iknonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[negative]	[11:18]	<ikonia_>	gustavo and ask yourself the question - why are you building your own kernel 99 out of a 100 people will have no issues
[negative]	[11:18]	<THJ>	gustavo: ah, like ikonia reckoned. i'm curious, why do you need to compile a kernel?
[negative]	[11:18]	<darkhack>	<Hairulfr> oh nevermind, I got it.
[positive]	[11:18]	<gustavo>	ikonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[negative]	[11:18]	<ikonia_>	gustavo then you don't need to ask how to fix it
[positive]	[11:18]	<darkhack>	<Hairulfr> Thanks alot
[positive]	[11:18]	<THJ>	I consider myself a power user and I never needed to compile a new kernel for any modern Linux.
[negative]	[11:18]	<Hairulfr>	darkhack: No problem, err.
[neutral]	[11:18]	<gustavo>	learning porpuses
[neutral]	[11:18]	<ikonia_>	THJ exaclty
[negative]	[11:18]	<THJ>	the worst thing I've had to do is compile new kernel modules.
[neutral]	[11:18]	<ikonia_>	gustavo your not learning much by getting panics
[neutral]	[11:19]	<THJ>	lol
[neutral]	[11:19]	<magnetron>	!kernel | gustavo
[negative]	[11:19]	<ubotu>	gustavo: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see @HLINK  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see @HLINK
[negative]	[11:19]	<ikonia_>	gustavo learn how to build a kernel and the ins and outs of what causes it to panic etc etc
[negative]	[11:19]	<Dell-Net>	diff between server and desktop installations is that server has no x server and has more server appz installed then desktop
[neutral]	[11:19]	<orbin>	seamus7: i'd leave it as is.  is nm-applet running?
[positive]	[11:19]	<gustavo>	lol, not really... but it happens while i was trying :)
[neutral]	[11:19]	<frank95com>	ciao
[negative]	[11:19]	<seamus7>	orbin: sorry that's what i mean ... how do i get nm-applet to activate?

[negative]	[11:19]	<ikonia_>	"gustavo then don't say ""I've done it many times"" when someone advises you to learn"
[negative]	[11:19]	<THJ>	No problem

[neutral]	[11:20]	<ikonia_>	vimalg2 if you have a hardware issue, log it in launchpad
[negative]	[11:20]	<Analemma23>	Here's a general question for you guys -- if I've installed one of the betas and have been using the update manager, does that mean my kernal is updated too?
[neutral]	[11:20]	<Hairulfr>	vimalg2: Isch, but you have gfx, right?

[negative]	[11:21]	<roland_>	hey, i just downloaded right now a fresh copy of ubuntu 7.04 and burnt it on a new blank cd and inserted it to a pc on wich i wanted to install it.. my first experiences are that most programs crash, the desktop is extremely slow and unresponsive, and random applications crash including the installer
[negative]	[11:21]	<orbin>	seamus7: make sure you have the notification area appplet on your panel, then try running nm-applet via alt+f2
[negative]	[11:21]	<ubotu>	Analemma23: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[negative]	[11:21]	<THJ>	How customized is the Ubuntu kernel? I imagine it's pretty bare-bone with all possible drivers compiled out as modules. Ubuntu being fond of GNU, I also would imagine it has no custom patches.
[negative]	[11:21]	<Hairulfr>	Analemma23: Yes, it Final if you accepted the automatic updates
[positive]	[11:21]	<gargoyle80>	what is currently the best direct connect client for ubuntu? :)
[negative]	[11:21]	<seamus7>	orbin: ok thx
[negative]	[11:21]	<ikonia_>	magnetron any ahcen you can use > instead of | with ubotu
[neutral]	[11:21]	<ikonia_>	chance that should read
[negative]	[11:21]	<slackern>	Analemma23, if you got the 2.6.20-15 kernel then you got the latest (open a terminal and type 'uname -a' to see)
[negative]	[11:21]	<ikonia_>	THJ pretty stock
[negative]	[11:21]	<THJ>	Not that a patch goes against the principles of free software in any way, but it does seem to be the proprietary distributions that are fond of customizing the kernel.
[neutral]	[11:22]	<vimalg2>	ikonia: thanks i'm checking out launchpad now. its something i;ve never explored b4

[negative]	[11:22]	<ap1>	"How do I get Edgy kernel source? no package ""linux-tree""?"
[positive]	[11:22]	<THJ>	gustavo, if you want to learn a lot about Linux, I strongly recommend playing around with Slackware.
[neutral]	[11:22]	<Hairulfr>	roland_: It's a livecd...
[negative]	[11:22]	<ikonia_>	roland_ keep in mind your running from ram on a livecd
[positive]	[11:22]	<THJ>	though even it has a package manager now, hehe
[neutral]	[11:23]	<ikonia_>	ap1 there is a source deb
[positive]	[11:23]	<THJ>	maybe gentoo is the new slackware, hehe
[negative]	[11:23]	<roland_>	Hairlufr: exactly, thats why using a livecd to test / install system is a hugely bad idea
[positive]	[11:23]	<gustavo>	maybe in another time, im not good enough :)
[negative]	[11:23]	<vimalg2>	Hairulfr: yeah. But VESA sucks. I'm interested in knowing if the Ubuntu team would integrate the OpenSource reverse-engineered drivers for VIA chipset(ref. www.unichrome.org) into their future releases
[negative]	[11:23]	<ap1>	ikonia_: where is source deb?
[negative]	[11:23]	<roland_>	anything can go wrong anytime
[positive]	[11:23]	<THJ>	when i started out in 1997 it was slackware 3.0 :)
[negative]	[11:23]	<ikonia_>	roland_ then use the alternate cd
[neutral]	[11:23]	<ikonia_>	ap1 in the ubuntu repo's
[negative]	[11:23]	<Hairulfr>	roland_: Maybe you are system is shte. I've never had problems with livecds anywhere
[neutral]	[11:23]	<ikonia_>	THJ that conversation is better in -offtopic
[neutral]	[11:23]	<Hairulfr>	Tab compeltion...bah
[negative]	[11:24]	<ap1>	ikonia_: I can't find the package name?
[neutral]	[11:24]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr careful on the language
[neutral]	[11:24]	<vimalg2>	correction www.openchrome.org
[negative]	[11:24]	<THJ>	ikonia: sorry, its so easy to forget, the channel name being #ubuntu, not #ubuntu-help. ^^

[neutral]	[11:24]	<Amec>	F*
[negative]	[11:24]	<gustavo>	why my kernel doesnt save my bzimage on /arch/x86_64/boot instead of /arch/i386/boot ?
[neutral]	[11:24]	<ikonia_>	ap1 use synaptic and browse
[negative]	[11:24]	<roland_>	Hairulfr: my system runs edgy 6.10 fine (Except yesterday when suddenly out of nowhere all system started crashing and nothing worked anymore not even dpkg)
[neutral]	[11:25]	<ikonia_>	gustavo this is not kernel help
[negative]	[11:25]	<arooni>	how can i get ubuntu to ACTUALLY REMOVE ALL FILES when i do sudo apt-get remove eclipse  (i want all bits of eclipse gone)

[neutral]	[11:25]	<MaX_ManIc>	yello
[negative]	[11:25]	<DVS01>	roland_: sounds like a hardware problem
[negative]	[11:25]	<ap1>	I tried Synaptic and apt-cache
[neutral]	[11:25]	<THJ>	dpkg --purge yourpackage, arooni
[negative]	[11:25]	<dungodung>	gah! I insert the CD rom, but it won't upgrade from it. only from the internet... even after disabling the internet updates
[positive]	[11:25]	<gustavo>	oh, u are very helpful :)
[neutral]	[11:25]	<siimo>	woot new ubuntu downloading now!!
[positive]	[11:25]	<gustavo>	is there a chan for kernel help? :)
[negative]	[11:25]	<DVS01>	roland_: try using memtest86 to see if you have any ram problems
[neutral]	[11:25]	<ikonia_>	gustavo #kernel
[positive]	[11:25]	<ikonia_>	gustavo they are quite harsh though
[neutral]	[11:25]	<siimo>	gustavo: also try ##linux
[negative]	[11:26]	<Amec>	when I try to install Feisty it gives me this error: Failed to fetch @HLINK Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[positive]	[11:26]	<DVS01>	roland_: also, try googling around for cpu stress testers. i also recommend keeping track of cpu and system temperature
[neutral]	[11:26]	<roland_>	DVS01: weird, only ubuntu does this, other OS runs fine
[negative]	[11:26]	<ikonia_>	Amec its failed to fetch that package
[negative]	[11:26]	<Trist_an>	are the packages which are dowloaded by synaptic, apt and so on are kept locally on hard drive or are they deleted after installation?
[neutral]	[11:26]	<Amec>	yes
[neutral]	[11:26]	<magnetron>	arooni: sudo apt-get autoremove
[negative]	[11:26]	<DVS01>	roland_: if thats the case, then that's really weird
[neutral]	[11:26]	<arooni>	THJ:  is there another option?  eclipse still sthinkgs its there
[positive]	[11:26]	<Amec>	but it keeps doing it
[positive]	[11:26]	<THJ>	"that's the thing about OSS volunteer help. ""thou arth inferior, but I shalt helpeth thou."", okay, time to shut up. :)"
[negative]	[11:26]	<ikonia_>	Amec and thats doesn't look like a fresh install as its usinb multiverse
[neutral]	[11:26]	<noiesmo>	Trist_an, they are nornmally stored in /var/cace/apt/archives/
[negative]	[11:26]	<Hairulfr>	dungodung: I thin you need the alternate to do that
[neutral]	[11:27]	<noiesmo>	cace cache
[neutral]	[11:27]	<Amec>	what..?
[neutral]	[11:27]	<THJ>	"arooni: eclipse ""thinks"" its there?"
[neutral]	[11:27]	<dungodung>	Hairulfr: alternate?
[negative]	[11:27]	<vimalg2>	arooni: its probably just your userprefs stuff
[neutral]	[11:27]	<ap1>	ikonia_: linux-source it was
[positive]	[11:27]	<Hairulfr>	dungodung: Check it before you download it. There is an alternate ISO available
[neutral]	[11:27]	<Amec>	I'm upgrading through Update Manager
[negative]	[11:27]	<ikonia_>	Amec the repo name is selecting from multiverse, I'm not aware thatmultiverse is enabled at install time
[negative]	[11:27]	<arooni>	ok this autoremove thing worked
[negative]	[11:27]	<dungodung>	:(
[negative]	[11:27]	<THJ>	arooni: if you removed eclipse using apt-get or dpkg you can probably safely delete the remaining eclipse-related files.
[negative]	[11:27]	<Trist_an>	noiesmo, can I rm * what is archives?
[positive]	[11:27]	<ikonia_>	Amec that package may not exist in the fesity repo
[negative]	[11:27]	<Trist_an>	noiesmo, can I rm * what is IN archives?
[negative]	[11:28]	<dungodung>	why would there be two different isos.. one for normal install, one for upgrades?
[negative]	[11:28]	<Amec>	Then how do I install Feisty...?
[negative]	[11:28]	<Hairulfr>	dungodung: I thin so yes
[negative]	[11:28]	<ikonia_>	Amec check if that package exists, or try another mirror
[negative]	[11:28]	<ikonia_>	Amec or use the cd
[negative]	[11:28]	<Trist_an>	or is there a proper way to empty apt cache
[neutral]	[11:28]	<arooni>	whats best way to install eclipse?  sudo-apt get or........ dloading from website
[neutral]	[11:28]	<ikonia_>	Trist_an apt-get update
[negative]	[11:29]	<Amec>	:(
[neutral]	[11:29]	<noiesmo>	Trist_an, yes you can just use sudo apt-get clean
[neutral]	[11:29]	<ikonia_>	arooni apt-get -
[neutral]	[11:29]	<magnetron>	Trist_an: sudo apt-get autoclean
[positive]	[11:29]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : cant seem to find it
[negative]	[11:29]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine find what sorry
[negative]	[11:29]	<Trist_an>	ok thanks because it eats 1.3G on my / partition so...
[negative]	[11:29]	<Lidis>	I'm having a bit of a problem installing Ubuntu 7.04 on my laptop. I can't see my windows or linux partions in the installation program. It can access the partions then I mount /dev/hda2 and hda3 systems. But the installations says that the disk is unalocated.
[negative]	[11:30]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : the md5sum for the dvd iso, this here only for cds : @HLINK
[negative]	[11:30]	<arooni>	is it better to download the next ubutnu now.... or to wait a bit?
[negative]	[11:30]	<Trist_an>	I did sudo apt-get autoclean but my archives are still 1.1G instead of 1.3....
[positive]	[11:30]	<Hairulfr>	arooni: The beta has been working flawlessly for weeks, it think it's safe to download the final now
[positive]	[11:30]	<Hairulfr>	arooni: For me it has
[neutral]	[11:30]	<magnetron>	Trist_an: my mistake, it is sudo apt-get clean
[neutral]	[11:30]	<mneptok>	USE BITTORRENT!
[positive]	[11:30]	<Trist_an>	okami, thanks magnetron
[positive]	[11:31]	<mrigns>	bittorrent downloads are not working well in feisty, portforwarding in my router and iptables is set
[negative]	[11:31]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine thats strange its not in the md5 list
[negative]	[11:31]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr thats not true
[neutral]	[11:31]	<mrigns>	it connect to seeders but just dont start downloading well
[negative]	[11:31]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr there was a serious kernel error less than a week ago
[neutral]	[11:31]	<berent>	I have a ubuntu 6.1 LTS right now
[negative]	[11:31]	<Hairulfr>	ikonia: For some, yeah, had no problems here.
[neutral]	[11:31]	<berent>	can i upgrade it to 7.04
[neutral]	[11:31]	<mneptok>	mrigns: what client?
[neutral]	[11:31]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : maybe because they serve only the torrent for the dvd, hence chances are torrent download will be 100% perfect
[neutral]	[11:31]	<berent>	via dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[11:31]	<ikonia_>	berent from 6.0.1 you'll have to do a clean update
[neutral]	[11:31]	<magnetron>	!upgrade >berent
[neutral]	[11:31]	<Trist_an>	berent, you have to upgrade to edgy and afterwards to feisty
[negative]	[11:32]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine possible but not how it sould be
[neutral]	[11:32]	<gharz>	exit
[neutral]	[11:32]	<mrigns>	mneptok: gnome-bittorrent, bittornado, azureus, no isp problem, they are working under etch
[neutral]	[11:32]	<berent>	I already have a edgy - edgy -> 6.10 right
[neutral]	[11:32]	<spikeb>	yes
[neutral]	[11:32]	<spikeb>	and you can go from 6.10->7.04
[negative]	[11:32]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine if you look in that dir - there is no dvd image
[negative]	[11:33]	<guillem101>	Can I interrupt the ugrade process safely? The download speed has drastically gone down and I need to stop the process and continue it perhaps tomorrow...
[negative]	[11:33]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine thats why there is no dvd md5
[negative]	[11:33]	<ikonia_>	guillem101 I doubt it
[negative]	[11:33]	<Trist_an>	sorry berent the LST confused me, Edgy is not LTS
[negative]	[11:33]	<berent>	spikeb : how ; should i change my sources.lst?
[neutral]	[11:33]	<mneptok>	mrigns: are you set to a statci IP for the forwarding? have yfou checked to ensure the IP you think you have is, in fact, correct?
[negative]	[11:33]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : there's no md5sum in the dvd's torrent directory either
[negative]	[11:33]	<Amec>	"When I go to the Update Manager, a window pops up saying: ""Not all updates can be installed"" and it gives me two options. Distrobution Upgrade and cancel. When I click Distro Upgrade it goes to download and install Edgy (which I already have). Why is it doing this?"
[neutral]	[11:33]	<Trist_an>	!update | berent
[neutral]	[11:33]	<ubotu>	berent: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[neutral]	[11:33]	<hagabaka>	weird

[positive]	[11:33]	<hagabaka>	fglrx is magically working for me again
[negative]	[11:33]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine thats a torret dir
[neutral]	[11:34]	<hagabaka>	the package didn't get updated just now did it?
[negative]	[11:34]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, what stage is it at if its just downloading files then yes you can it will pick up from wr it left of when you start upgrade
[negative]	[11:34]	<arooni>	how can i make ubuntu take a dump
[neutral]	[11:34]	<mrigns>	mneptok: i tried different ports and set them all on forwarding on my router and configured the iptables in feisty. it did all work in feisty beta though
[neutral]	[11:34]	<ikonia_>	arooni dump of what
[neutral]	[11:34]	<Hairulfr>	arooni: LOL
[negative]	[11:34]	<magnetron>	 arooni: you mean a screenshot?
[positive]	[11:34]	<guillem101>	hmm download speed is varying from time to time ... guess mirrors are a bit collapsed
[negative]	[11:34]	<arooni>	its 2am and arooni is getting a little silly because of sleep deprivation
[negative]	[11:34]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : that's right. There's no iso dir for dvd, hence no md5sum file. That's why I asked my first qn
[neutral]	[11:34]	<ikonia_>	arooni byeeeeeee
[negative]	[11:35]	<Hairulfr>	arooni: Prt scr? Screenshot you mean?
[negative]	[11:35]	<arooni>	sorry ikonia_
[positive]	[11:35]	<guillem101>	noiesmo, exactly, it is at the downloading packages process
[negative]	[11:35]	<arooni>	actually thats a good question
[negative]	[11:35]	<ikonia_>	richard-blaine looks relastic explination

[neutral]	[11:35]	<ryancr>	i just enabled compiz and its nice and smooth...but the minimize, close buttons sometimes don't respond to a click, any ideas??
[negative]	[11:35]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr no, he was just being foolish
[neutral]	[11:35]	<ryancr>	this is on a intel 915
[neutral]	[11:35]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, then just stop it then when you run the command again it will pick up were it left off
[negative]	[11:35]	<Hairulfr>	ikonia: Oh, I'm a humorless fool
[negative]	[11:35]	<aimtrainer>	hi can anyone please help me to build truecrypt from source in feisty? From what I read it should not be a problem with the latest version but I just dont know how to do it
[positive]	[11:35]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, :)
[negative]	[11:35]	<guillem101>	"noiesmo, , to stop it, I just force the close of the ""Distribution upgrade"" window?"
[negative]	[11:36]	<ikonia_>	Amec what are you upgrading from
[neutral]	[11:36]	<Amec>	Edgy
[negative]	[11:36]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, should do it
[positive]	[11:36]	<berent>	Trist_an : It shows my system is up to date
[neutral]	[11:36]	<fabiim>	where can i find the changelog for feisty ?
[negative]	[11:36]	<ikonia_>	Amec it looks like all the packages you currently have installed are not upgradable/compatible with fesity
[negative]	[11:36]	<Amec>	How can I fix this...?
[neutral]	[11:36]	<ikonia_>	Amec so the dist upgrade is taking the distro to the latest version that is compatible (at a guess)
[neutral]	[11:36]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, apt-get might still run in the background just open terminal and check with ps ax command
[negative]	[11:36]	<richard-blaine>	ikonia_ : well maybe i can just trust my torrent download. It's torrent!
[neutral]	[11:37]	<ikonia_>	Amec look at the packages that are not supported/compatible
[negative]	[11:37]	<Hairulfr>	"I don't know if easyubuntu works with feisty 100%, if it does, wouldn't it be an idea setting it as topic for all the new users? It ""uncomplicates"" thing a bit"
[positive]	[11:37]	<guillem101>	noiesmo, OK, thanks. SInce I have two machines doing the same (differerent arch and different ISP provider) I will use one to test the interruption ....
[positive]	[11:37]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr easyubuntu is not an ubuntu product and not supported
[negative]	[11:37]	<ikonia_>	Hairulfr so has no business in here
[positive]	[11:37]	<guillem101>	noiesmo, thanks for your help
[negative]	[11:37]	<Amec>	It doesn't give me a list..
[positive]	[11:37]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, it'll be right :)
[neutral]	[11:37]	<ikonia_>	Amec check the log

[neutral]	[11:38]	<Amec>	kk
[negative]	[11:38]	<rohan>	torrent.ubuntu.com is down ? my BT client cannot connect to it
[negative]	[11:38]	<noiesmo>	guillem101, if packages were being installed i would not want to stop it but there just downloading and apt-get keeps partial downloaded files for later
[neutral]	[11:38]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, yes
[neutral]	[11:38]	<rohan>	i am using the torrent downloaded from releases.ubuntu.com
[negative]	[11:38]	<bullgard4>	What does it mean: 'to pull up a terminal' (Subject: irssi and screen)
[negative]	[11:38]	<foug>	can someone explain what cached and shared memory is?
[positive]	[11:39]	<ikonia_>	foug its shared memory from your system thats resident in cache
[neutral]	[11:39]	<aimtrainer>	LaszloKv, @HLINK
[negative]	[11:39]	<foug>	ikonia_: so it's ok if all my memory is cached?
[neutral]	[11:39]	<ikonia_>	"foug shared is used by multiple ""things"" caches is stuff thats referenced"
[negative]	[11:39]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, do you want the folder to have write permission for other user?
[negative]	[11:39]	<ikonia_>	foug depends on whats caching it
[negative]	[11:39]	<Notchnick>	can I get a link of a decent version for a gparted live cd.. to repartition drives
[negative]	[11:40]	<LaszloKv>	No, I want it to be read only.
[negative]	[11:40]	<foug>	ikonia_: that i don't know, so far beryl, exaile and gaim are running.
[negative]	[11:40]	<bullgard4>	foug: 'cached memory' is a memory device which stores data temporarily. An example is a RAM between your main storage and your hard disk.
[neutral]	[11:40]	<spikeb>	berent, you can force it to check specifically for upgrades by typing sudo update-manager -c in a terminal window
[neutral]	[11:40]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, go to @HLINK and change what should be changed and afterwards put it in /etc/samba/smb.conf
[positive]	[11:40]	<ikonia_>	foug its probably the kernel doing it which is fine
[negative]	[11:40]	<mneptok>	oh dear God. some PCWorld writer is recommending Automatix.
[neutral]	[11:40]	<orbin>	bullgard4: it means open one up
[negative]	[11:40]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, mainly change the path and writeable to no
[positive]	[11:41]	<ikonia_>	mneptok please give me his name, so I can send an email
[neutral]	[11:41]	<magnetron>	!terminal > bullgard4
[neutral]	[11:41]	<foug>	ikonia_: k cool, the linux memory monitor is more technical than the one litestep had when i used windows

[positive]	[11:41]	<berent>	spikeb : thanks
[negative]	[11:41]	<mneptok>	ikonia_: Automatix will take care of that, i guess.
[neutral]	[11:41]	<spikeb>	berent, you bet.
[negative]	[11:41]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, also in smb.conf in the Authentication section you have to have security = share
[positive]	[11:41]	<foug>	bullgard4: ahh cool, makes sense thanks :D was wondering cuz my memory monitor is completly coloured out. No free memory, most of it is cache though
[negative]	[11:42]	<ikonia_>	mneptok where did you read this recommendation
[negative]	[11:42]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an I have it set up with guest ok and read only and such.

[neutral]	[11:42]	<bullgard4>	orbin: What is the difference between 'to open a terminal' and 'to open a terminal up'?
[positive]	[11:42]	<mneptok>	magnetron: why are you telling me about Automatix? :)
[neutral]	[11:43]	<berent>	spikeb : what are the major enhancements in fiesty?

[negative]	[11:43]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an Yep.
[positive]	[11:43]	<spikeb>	berent, updated packages, and the restricted drivers manager.
[negative]	[11:43]	<bitninja25>	Hey guys, I have a question about the wireless networks manager...for some reason when I put in my key, which I know is right because I use it on live CDs and the like, the box keeps coming back. I guess Ubuntu has out-of-the-box support for the IPW3945 chipset because that's what I'm using in case it helps...
[neutral]	[11:43]	<arooni>	can someone help me installing eclipse
[neutral]	[11:43]	<arooni>	its dying for me
[negative]	[11:43]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, and it doesn't work. Can you see your folder?
[positive]	[11:43]	<Decadent>	I've problems on updating to feisty from edgy. When i start to update it gives an error saying: Your system does not contain ubuntu-desctop package and it was not possible to detect which version of ubuntu you are running. please install one of the packages above first using synaptik
[negative]	[11:43]	<bullgard4>	magnetron: Your answer is insufficient. I do know what a terminal is.
[neutral]	[11:43]	<Decadent>	wha must i do??
[negative]	[11:43]	<berent>	spikeb : how do i install just a server version?
[negative]	[11:44]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: what are you trying to do?
[neutral]	[11:44]	<spikeb>	berent, you can download a server install cd image, if you wish.
[neutral]	[11:44]	<tommy_>	can someone help me?
[negative]	[11:44]	<berent>	spikeb : cant i upgrade to it?
[negative]	[11:44]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an, When I go to my ip address I can see the folder I want shared, but when I click it, it says my permission might be denied.
[neutral]	[11:44]	<magnetron>	bullgard4: it means open a terminal
[positive]	[11:44]	<mneptok>	HI JONO! WELCOME TO HAPPYLAND!
[negative]	[11:44]	<tommy_>	im having that same tty error when trying to install 7.04
[neutral]	[11:44]	<mneptok>	*facepalm*
[negative]	[11:44]	<orbin>	bullgard4: IMO it's the same thing
[negative]	[11:44]	<spikeb>	berent, the upgrade process will just upgrade whatever you have installed.
[negative]	[11:44]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, you don't have a ; before security = share right?
[neutral]	[11:45]	<arooni>	how can i find all files on my comp with eclipse in them
[negative]	[11:45]	<bullgard4>	mneptok: I am trying to understand why screen could help me to use irssi better as Ubuntu documentation suggests.
[negative]	[11:45]	<richard-blaine>	 ikonia_ : well, there's a md5sum.txt for every file inside the dvd iso, I guess that will do, considering.
[negative]	[11:45]	<arooni>	i mean eclipse in titles
[neutral]	[11:45]	<jono>	mneptok: can I join the happy club?
[negative]	[11:45]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, I can post my  smb.conf if you want
[negative]	[11:45]	<berent>	spikeb: how long will it take to upgrade. i mean size
[negative]	[11:45]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an, Nope, no semi-colon.

[negative]	[11:45]	<ryancr>	silly compiz
[positive]	[11:45]	<ay_>	Hi Is there any alternative dapper drake installation CD's?
[positive]	[11:45]	<ay_>	(with newer kernels)
[neutral]	[11:45]	<bullgard4>	orbin: Ok. Thank you.
[neutral]	[11:45]	<magnetron>	arooni: don't delete the files manually, use synaptic to install /uninstall software
[negative]	[11:46]	<gustavo>	is there any way to upgrade a 386 system to amd-64?
[neutral]	[11:46]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an, Posting your smb.conf would probably help.
[neutral]	[11:46]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, @HLINK
[positive]	[11:46]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: if you don't know what a terminal is, irssi+screen will be more frustration than its worth, IMO.
[neutral]	[11:46]	<Trist_an>	LaszloKv, I have to go for lunch. pm if if it works or not
[positive]	[11:46]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: No. Dapper only has old kernels, it's the whole point of new releases to get new software ;)
[neutral]	[11:46]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: use a GUI client until you get on your feet in Linux, and revisit this in a couple months.
[negative]	[11:46]	<bullgard4>	mneptok: Who tells you that I do not know what a 'terminal' is? I do know what a terminal is.
[negative]	[11:47]	<Notchnick>	can I get a link of a decent version for a gparted live cd.. to repartition drives
[negative]	[11:47]	<babo>	this is the second time that my system upgrade has failed with errors such as ...

[neutral]	[11:47]	<tommy_>	is there a solution to this:     /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off
[positive]	[11:47]	<LaszloKv>	Trist_an, Thanks.
[negative]	[11:47]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: 05:43 < bullgard4> magnetron: Your answer is insufficient. I do know what a terminal is.  <--- sorry, read too fast
[neutral]	[11:47]	<coz_>	who is resonsible for the feisty beryl default repo
[negative]	[11:47]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: Eh. Yes. But not for LTS-releases.
[positive]	[11:47]	<bullgard4>	mneptok: Your speech contradicts the Ubuntu rules.
[negative]	[11:47]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: what are you stuck on?
[neutral]	[11:47]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: Servers that is.
[neutral]	[11:47]	<foug>	is there a command to refresh my memory? so it's not all cached
[positive]	[11:47]	<matt__>	so anything that is worth checking out that feisty can do that edgy couldn't do?
[negative]	[11:47]	<mneptok>	bullgard4: excuse me?
[neutral]	[11:47]	<dgold>	babo: those are non-canonical repos
[neutral]	[11:47]	<ay_>	Debian usually has loads of alternative bootdisks.
[negative]	[11:47]	<berent>	spikeb: how long will it take to upgrade. i mean size
[neutral]	[11:48]	<ay_>	After it's up and running. Kernel isn't a problem.
[negative]	[11:48]	<magnetron>	Notchnick: if you have the Ubuntu desktop cd, you can use that. it has gparted on it already
[neutral]	[11:48]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: Why shouldn't it be? Old releases are frozen, new releases get new kernels.
[negative]	[11:48]	<spikeb>	berent, hmm, no idea actually i havent upgraded
[negative]	[11:48]	<protocol1>	hey I got those ATI drivers installed
[negative]	[11:48]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: So what do you suggest I run on a productions server (Say 20 of them)
[neutral]	[11:48]	<magnetron>	protocol1: nice
[negative]	[11:48]	<babo>	dgold: why is it going to non-canonical repos ? Should I comment them out of my repo selection ?
[neutral]	[11:48]	<protocol1>	yeah they awesome
[negative]	[11:49]	<berent>	mneptok : how long will it take to upgrade from 6.1 to 7.04. i mean size
[neutral]	[11:49]	<babo>	what's that file called again ?
[positive]	[11:49]	<MagnusR>	Hi! Is it an easy way to see what packages are new in the repository for feisty compared to edgy?
[positive]	[11:49]	<dgold>	bullgard4: the irssi+screen combo is good if you leave your irssi session running on a emote computer, which means you can come back to it later without losing connectivity
[positive]	[11:49]	<pukkie>	orbin: thanks, but now i still don't know nothing about the repositories and such :) are they the same?
[negative]	[11:49]	<tommy_>	someone
[negative]	[11:49]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: Either dapper (with your own kernel, if you absolutely need it), or edgy (which is quite stable now).
[negative]	[11:49]	<mneptok>	berent: depends on how you do it.
[negative]	[11:49]	<ay_>	I can't upgrade dist on servers every 18 months. When you got hundreds of them. That's what LTS is for.
[negative]	[11:49]	<tommy_>	how do i fix this :            /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off
[neutral]	[11:49]	<protocol1>	hopefully I dont lockup in Counter Stike now
[neutral]	[11:49]	<dgold>	babo: check the comments file - see *why* the freecontrib.org/plf stanza is in your sources.list
[negative]	[11:50]	<berent>	mneptok : i am doing it via update-manager
[negative]	[11:50]	<guillem101>	"noiesmo, The process seems to be as follows: 1 kill process called ""feisty"" 2 goto /etc/apt and copy sources.list.distUpgrade to sources.list"
[positive]	[11:50]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: Yes, but if the kernel doesn't support your hardware, it's usually too new. You can't run MS-DOS 5.0 on current systems either ;)
[negative]	[11:50]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: I can't run edgy, because that is out of support in a short while. dapper with own kernel is nice. But how.
[positive]	[11:50]	<mneptok>	berent: good luck. the mirrors are hammered.
[neutral]	[11:50]	<Angel-SL>	hi, where do i find the MD5SUMs?
[negative]	[11:50]	<orbin>	pukkie: my guess is yes, but perhaps you should ask in the relevant channel?  i don't run one.
[negative]	[11:50]	<bullgard4>	dgold: But if I do not  use a remote computer, screen will give no value added, right?
[negative]	[11:50]	<guillem101>	noiesmo, I'm reboooting to see if I can continue from where I was...
[positive]	[11:50]	<mneptok>	berent: that will take quite a bit of time
[negative]	[11:50]	<Stig>	Hi. How to I check to make sure my nvidia graphics drivers are installed correctly?
[neutral]	[11:50]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: There are guides for getting your own kernel in dapper...
[negative]	[11:50]	<adultswim>	I read online that you're supposed to go to System > Preferences > Session > Session Options to disable the gnome splash screen, but the option isnt there... did it get moved to a adifferent place for fiesty?
[neutral]	[11:50]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: Yes of course. But you need to get the installer running first.
[negative]	[11:50]	<berent>	mneptok : any idea about size approx .
[negative]	[11:51]	<ay_>	Can't install if the installer does not see the raid or the networkcard.
[neutral]	[11:51]	<Angel-SL>	hi, where do i find the MD5SUMs?
[negative]	[11:51]	<tommy_>	"how do i fix this:               ""/bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off"""
[negative]	[11:51]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: I guess I don't have a good solution then. :\
[positive]	[11:51]	<mneptok>	berent: no idea. depends on the individual.
[neutral]	[11:51]	<ay_>	This goes for _all_ new Dell's and IBM servers.
[negative]	[11:51]	<dgold>	bullgard4: I use screen on non-networked computers - I like to be able to create new windows, run processed and come back to them without worrying about closing the gnome-terminal window. YMMV
[negative]	[11:51]	<lzap>	hello, how to upgrade from a mirror? I mean, I wonder to click on update in update-manager, its so slow and I wonder if it will use the main archive (which is currently under high load)
[negative]	[11:51]	<babo>	dgold: I dunno. It just says Penguin Liberation Front. I guess I shoudl comment out that and quite a few of the other repos too ? They are probably getting /. with the upgrade ...
[neutral]	[11:51]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: You can try Debian, that might work.
[positive]	[11:51]	<alleyoopster>	Angel-SL: you can find them on the cd
[neutral]	[11:51]	<berent>	mneptok : individual. what do u mean?
[negative]	[11:51]	<tommy_>	"is anyone having the same problem as me?                    ""/bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off"""
[neutral]	[11:51]	<Angel-SL>	alleyoopster: ...
[neutral]	[11:51]	<magnetron>	!md5 | Angel-SL
[negative]	[11:51]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: Yes. That's whats we've been running for the last 10 years.
[negative]	[11:52]	<Tomcat_>	ay_: As I said, you can't expect old software to run on new servers, and Ubuntu only gets an LTS release every couple of years... :\
[neutral]	[11:52]	<Angel-SL>	!md5
[negative]	[11:52]	<babo>	do I have to reload anything after updating sources.list ?
[negative]	[11:52]	<orbin>	Stig: run glxinfo and you should hopefully see stuff about nvidia and direct rendering should say yes.
[negative]	[11:52]	<mneptok>	berent: if you have hundreds of extra packages installed that i don't, your upgrade takes longer.
[positive]	[11:52]	<BlackAnthrax>	so any new software for feisty worth checking out?
[negative]	[11:52]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: That's why you release newer install-media.
[positive]	[11:52]	<Stig>	Is System > Administration > Restricted drivers manager the correct way to install GFX drivers on Feisty for my nvidia graphics card?
[neutral]	[11:52]	<ubotu>	Angel-SL: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see @HLINK or @HLINK
[positive]	[11:52]	<bullgard4>	dgold: Understood. Thank you very much.
[negative]	[11:52]	<mrigns>	aaaah this torrent issue annoys me :( the logs won't show any probs

[positive]	[11:53]	<ay_>	Tomcat_: Or a way to load newer drivers during install from a cd or floppy.
[negative]	[11:53]	<adultswim>	how do i disable the gnome splash screen in feisty?
[positive]	[11:53]	<alleyoopster>	Angel-SL: if you have the cd , there is a file there md5, but I see the bot got off his arse :)
[negative]	[11:53]	<berent>	mneptok : ok lets say i press upgrade button in update-manager . will it show me size and ask me if i want to proceed or directly start off upgrading

[positive]	[11:55]	<os2mac>	gpg keyserver for email signatures
[neutral]	[11:55]	<babo>	is it safe to surf the net while upgrading ?
[positive]	[11:55]	<mneptok>	"berent: use a torrent to get the alternate CD. torrent downloads are really healthy right now. then, update your sources.list swapping ""feisty"" for ""edgy"" and ensure the Feisty CD is an available repo."
[negative]	[11:55]	<Stig>	OK. It looks like the nvidia drivers are installed. Now I would like a good desktop themes, etc. On Edgy I tried Beryl and had nothing but problems with it, it seemed to make my Ubuntu very slow, even though I have a very good hardware. What is Compiz like? Is it more stable than Beryl? Do I need to use both, or do they basically do the same thing?

[neutral]	[12:47]	<defrysk>	syock, yes
[negative]	[12:47]	<TheoMurpse>	gnomefreak: the only thing I see is what has been there since at least 6.06 when I first tried Ubuntu. My wireless connection is there. I go to it and type in the ssid for a known network nearby which is open, and it doesn't connect.
[neutral]	[12:47]	<parking->	how to make my HD to read/write so i can copy all files?
[negative]	[12:47]	<linoleum>	Slart: it tries to load the wfb module, but then say it doesn't exist.
[negative]	[12:47]	<slackern>	parking-: you want to enabled write support for NTFS?

[neutral]	[12:47]	<syock>	!final
[negative]	[12:47]	<ubotu>	If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[negative]	[12:47]	<gnomefreak>	TheoMurpse: than im not sure my wireless card is usable out of box
[neutral]	[12:47]	<parking->	slackern: its ext3 too

[positive]	[12:48]	<linoleum>	Slart: I have no idea :)
[neutral]	[12:48]	<sldkfj>	Does anyone know what channel to enter to find out  how I would tweak the width of Usplash ?
[positive]	[12:48]	<TheoMurpse>	gnomefreak: My wireless has been usable on the past 3 liveCDs, but when I actually install to the HDD it never works, and no one has ever been able to help me figure out why, despite the fact that my wireless card has an OSS driver, so it's not a proprietary problem. The exact same source code works excellent with other distros.
[positive]	[12:48]	<slackern>	parking-: i would say that use chown to change the owner of the folders where you need write/read access
[positive]	[12:49]	<peter77>	When I wobble the windows I can see the frame refresh flicker, but on my dads machine it's perfect

[neutral]	[12:50]	<parking->	slackern: how..... didn't try that yet
[negative]	[12:50]	<PirateHead>	How do you remove a symlink without deleting the file that it links to?
[positive]	[12:50]	<slackern>	parking-: and for ntfs read/write support you need 'ntfs-3g' package and 'ntfs-config' to have a little gui
[negative]	[12:50]	<linoleum>	Slart: ok I have found a solution
[negative]	[12:51]	<gnomefreak>	foug: if not in settings than you would have to figure out what part of the debian dir. when building to configure it during build (unless someone knows of a hack or a script)
[negative]	[12:51]	<linoleum>	Slart: it's a bug with the package. the module wtf is missing, so I have to take it from the run, then copy it where it should be installed by the nvigida-glx-new package
[negative]	[12:51]	<Erebus>	Um, stupid question - i downloaded the ISO from the link on ubuntu.com, which is a Live CD - I thought it also doubled as an installer, is this not the case?
[positive]	[12:51]	<Slart>	linoleum: mm, found some pages about it.. you're not the only one with that problem.. =)
[neutral]	[12:51]	<foug>	gnomefreak: rgr
[negative]	[12:51]	<Slart>	Erebus: it's supposed to be both... installer and live cd

[neutral]	[12:51]	<gnomefreak>	rgr?
[negative]	[12:51]	<slackern>	parking-: to use chown on a folder  you could for example use 'chown -R parking /myfolder' to make parking the owner of the files/folders -R is recursive

[negative]	[12:53]	<PirateHead>	jokoon: start the script with the line '#/bin/sh', without the single quotes, and then put the exact commands that you want to run after that. Works just like a BAT, pretty much.

[positive]	[01:04]	<ubotu>	forza-juve: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP.

For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

[positive]	[01:06]	<TheoMurpse>	I give up though. The past three releases wireless has always worked on the livecd, and it never works once installed to the hdd
[neutral]	[01:06]	<PirateHead>	ROnewbie: you can use GParted to delete the parttion that Edgy is on.
[negative]	[01:06]	<mc44>	ROnewbie: well, you can just format the partition if you have no data you want on it
[negative]	[01:06]	<TheoMurpse>	which boggles my mind, that something would work on teh livecd and then immediately not work once it's installed

[negative]	[01:07]	<ROnewbie>	mc44: sounds better than deleting the partition, how can I do it ?
[negative]	[01:07]	<PirateHead>	RONewbie: if you want to expand the Feisty partition to fill the space, however, you will probably have to use GParted off of a LiveCD for that operation, since you can't expand a mounted filesystme,.
[positive]	[01:07]	<sldkfj>	CookedGryphon, thanks
[negative]	[01:07]	<Huffalump>	PirateHead, something is wrong because that's not how Nautilus works.  If you delete a symlink/shortcut, then it does not delete the original/source file.... but merely the link.
[positive]	[01:07]	<PirateHead>	TheoMurpse: it's true that it's unintuitive, but there is a really good reason for it. :-)
[neutral]	[01:07]	<TMT[fi] >	Hello every1

[positive]	[01:07]	<ROnewbie>	PirateHead: I want that partition to remain an empty FAT32 so that I can access it from both feisty and XP (yeah, I'm running a dual boot ... no linux printer drivers)

[positive]	[01:08]	<sadleder>	TheoMurpse ah, ok, the trivial way ;-)
[negative]	[01:08]	<PirateHead>	Huffalump: perhaps it was a nautilus bug then? Or perhaps it wasn't truly a symlink, but some other kind of link that I don't know about?

[positive]	[01:08]	<PirateHead>	ROnewbie: That's easy to to with GParted. Just reformat the Edgy partition as fat32, and it'll do all the work.

[negative]	[01:08]	<Huffalump>	PirateHead, how about a little test?  Make a text file, then a link, and delete the link.
[negative]	[01:09]	<stian>	anybody have ANY ideas?
[negative]	[01:09]	<TheoMurpse>	PirateHead: The problem is, no one has ever been able to walk me through getting wireless working, and I've never been able to either (despite getting the same wireless running in Debian and Gentoo). So basically, I've been dual booting, with Ubuntu only being used when there's a new version out, hoping and praying that finally wireless works on my computer. It never does, despite the fact that there's no technical explanation -- sin
[negative]	[01:09]	<protocol1>	how do I go about removing a directory and everything in it?

[neutral]	[01:10]	<PirateHead>	Huffalump: the test worked like you said it ought to: it did not delete the original.
[negative]	[01:10]	<Slart>	Huffalump: I don't have this problem myself.. but there was someone here asking about it .. 30 mins ago.. I just did a quick google search and one of the first hits was a forum post about it.. with some links to solutions.. but yes.. it does sound ridiculous
[neutral]	[01:11]	<jokoon>	What command can I use to replace text in a file ?
[positive]	[01:11]	<TheoMurpse>	PirateHead: you're right, it does suck. I've probably put in 50+ hours on the wireless issue. It's literally the only reaosn I'm still using XP on my laptop. I could go back to Gentoo and it would all be fine, but I'm tired of compiling everything on a laptop.
[positive]	[01:11]	<Huffalump>	PirateHead: good!  Now, I can't think of what went wrong in your original error... but you should be able to use Nautilus with confidence that it works intuitively.
[negative]	[01:11]	<Huffalump>	TheoMurpse - Usually, I find the beginning to be a matter of determining how compatible your wifi card is.  If you're a centrino, then it's a slam dunk, for example.
[positive]	[01:11]	<stefg>	Aarin: That's the disks, not the controller. can you get fesity to boot by any means?

[negative]	[01:12]	<slackern>	jokoon: i think 'sed' can do that for you, but im not familiar with how to use it
[neutral]	[01:12]	<Bakey>	exor do sudo apt-get install build-essential
[neutral]	[01:12]	<bimberi>	[Ex0r] : install build-essential
[positive]	[01:12]	<TheoMurpse>	Huffalump I've used the rt2x00 driver for Gentoo for two years. The same driver is loaded with Knoppix, and it works with Debian. However, when I do Ubuntu, it works only on the livecd.

[positive]	[01:17]	<ubotu>	netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See @HLINK

[negative]	[01:27]	<brunoUT>	ok....
[negative]	[01:27]	<rambo3>	TheoMurpse, ok i think there is solution . ping never botherd me since it worked without it . Open worked without ping and WEP worked with ping

[negative]	[01:27]	<DjViper>	how do I make ubuntu connect to a default wlan when I boot up?

[negative]	[01:27]	<Bakey>	rgd: maybe there's some release notes on the mozilla website that would tell you
[neutral]	[01:28]	<Angel-SL>	ANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOTHER corrupted download..
[positive]	[01:28]	<LjL>	"|NewUser|: so do the swedish ones. but i think the ""main"" servers - i.e. archive.ubuntu.com - actually redirect to the united kingdom ones, so those would probably be the most strained"
[negative]	[01:28]	<rambo3>	TheoMurpse,search ubuntuforums howto for ralink and ping. You have no wireless security ?
[positive]	[01:28]	<Bakey>	angel-sl: this the burn errors :)

[neutral]	[01:28]	<Huffalump>	Is there a way, at the line command, to tell apt-get to use a specific archive source (that's not in your list)?

[neutral]	[01:30]	<Angel-SL>	*gets impaitient*
[negative]	[01:30]	<Huffalump>	Bakey: That's bad news, because I'm at a line command due to Fiesty not installing nvidia stuff correctly... and the us.archive keeps timing out, so I want to use another source (like se.archive... or someone fast)
[neutral]	[01:30]	<rambo3>	Huffalump, where do you live?

[negative]	[01:34]	<CookedGryphon>	nihil: you could just use the menu editor, right click on the menu and say edit menus

[neutral]	[01:40]	<Dextorion>	slackern: tried that aswell actually. But when i do install later on, i still get the same fault.  Its my eclipse that is broke, and it looks for startup.jar. But that file doesnt get installed when i do apt-get install eclipse.

[positive]	[01:42]	<Pici>	tarzeau: See ubotu's message above.
[negative]	[01:42]	<slackern>	Dextorion: could it be that you need to install some java package before?
[neutral]	[01:42]	<TooR4u>	tarzeau, okey i will try 1min
[neutral]	[01:42]	<finalbeta>	Does Feisty's codec install feature include support for WMA etc? Or does that still require 3th party repo's?
[negative]	[01:42]	<slackern>	Dextorion: that has been missed in dependencies or something?
[negative]	[01:42]	<atomiku>	hmm
[neutral]	[01:42]	<LjL>	finalbeta: the latter, i suspect
[negative]	[01:42]	<Dextorion>	slackern: alrihgty.  Strange this..  Its on my work machine, and i just had eclipse installed. But decided that it needed a reinstallation.
[negative]	[01:42]	<Dextorion>	slackern: no idea.
[positive]	[01:42]	<foof>	without starting any flames, why ubuntu over debian? :)
[neutral]	[01:42]	<spikeb>	tarzeau, @HLINK
[negative]	[01:42]	<atomiku>	I'm having trouble with the nvidia drivers, X fails to start (saying it cant load the drivers)
[negative]	[01:42]	<slackern>	Dextorion: I can try to install it here and see what happens
[positive]	[01:42]	<atomiku>	It was working fine :P
[negative]	[01:42]	<finalbeta>	LjL: yeah, I assumed as much 2. Kind off kills the whole point of it.
[positive]	[01:43]	<tarzeau>	spikeb, Pici thanks
[positive]	[01:43]	<DjViper>	foof: newer software, larger community
[negative]	[01:43]	<brunoUT>	LjL: thanks....but i have to head off to class before i can update
[neutral]	[01:43]	<user-land>	hi, is the upgrade to 7.04 problematic ?
[positive]	[01:43]	<brunoUT>	hopefully that works when i get back
[negative]	[01:43]	<jrib>	finalbeta: I can play them here and don't think I installed any gstreamer plugins by hand
[positive]	[01:43]	<gfather>	thanks
[negative]	[01:43]	<bimberi>	oktay: 1. needs to be the alternate cd.  2. insert it into a running system and follow the prompts
[positive]	[01:43]	<spikeb>	tarzeau, if you end up installing it, come back and let me know how it is - i have a family member waiting to see if she should upgrade or not :)
[neutral]	[01:43]	<finalbeta>	jrib: nice.
[neutral]	[01:43]	<slackern>	Dextorion: downloading and installing now
[positive]	[01:43]	<oktay>	bimberi: shoot. i already have the regular cd. full upgrade it is then. Thanks !! :)
[positive]	[01:43]	<LjL>	finalbeta: well, you *really* cannot distribute the Win32 codecs. that, Ubuntu just cannot do. still however, VLC should be able to play some WMA's, and maybe gstreamer can do the same
[neutral]	[01:43]	<enry>	!codec

[positive]	[01:43]	<Huffalump>	user-land - each experience is unique.  most people seem just fine.  I, however, have troubles with a bug related to nvidia drivers.
[neutral]	[01:43]	<oktay>	tarzeau: i thought you used debian
[positive]	[01:44]	<user-land>	thanks, huffalump.
[negative]	[01:44]	<spikeb>	debian is what my ppc using family member is going to be using if the community port sucks heh
[positive]	[01:44]	<user-land>	i remember the upgrade 6 month ago was problematic for a lot of users.
[neutral]	[01:44]	<Dextorion>	slackern: cool
[neutral]	[01:44]	<slackern>	Dextorion: it installed here and started
[negative]	[01:44]	<user-land>	they had to make a new install to avoid problems.
[positive]	[01:44]	<user-land>	so this time the upgrade is smooth for most ?
[negative]	[01:44]	<Dextorion>	slackern: should work. I bet it just me that broke it when uninstalling or something
[negative]	[01:44]	<slackern>	Dextorion: want a list of the packages it installed?
[negative]	[01:45]	<crolle17>	can somebody tell if it is possible to do some regexp with vi?
[negative]	[01:45]	<ferronica>	how to make my windows drive read and write??? both
[neutral]	[01:45]	<foof>	Are any ports better supported on debian?  I've got an amd64 box.
[negative]	[01:45]	<nicolah>	is it possible to upgrade to feisty using the dvd as a repo ?
[negative]	[01:45]	<atomiku>	So uh yeah, Any idea why startx is failing to load due to not being able to load the nvidia drivers?
[neutral]	[01:45]	<stefg>	!ntfs-3g | ferronica
[neutral]	[01:45]	<ubotu>	ferronica: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but please remember to keep backups of critical data. Installation instructions at @HLINK (Dapper) and @HLINK (Edgy)
[negative]	[01:45]	<MenZa>	Can anyone tell me how I choose sound card1 rather than sound card0 to play my sound?
[neutral]	[01:45]	<hakwaa>	exit
[negative]	[01:45]	<spikeb>	foof, they're officially supported, so yeah
[negative]	[01:45]	<Huffalump>	user-land, in my case the bug is quite amazing... someone (apparently) did not include all the necessary bits and pieces for nvidia drivers under certain conditions.  I've seen some very confused people killing themselves to solve it... esp when i look in the mirror.  But I know it's not affecting everyone.
[negative]	[01:45]	<Dextorion>	slackern: nah.. im quite sure i have them, its just..  i dont understand why it doesnt install that startup.jar file.
[positive]	[01:45]	<tarzeau>	oktay: i do :)
[neutral]	[01:45]	<MenZa>	!sound
[negative]	[01:45]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[neutral]	[01:45]	<tarzeau>	oktay: it's for others, not me
[negative]	[01:45]	<Dextorion>	slackern: it should reside inside /usr/lib/eclipse or something like that.
[negative]	[01:45]	<crolle17>	i mean it is possible to insert some character by regexp?
[negative]	[01:45]	<Christopherl>	how do I open/close ports in Ubuntu 7.04?
[positive]	[01:45]	<oktay>	tarzeau: good for you :)
[negative]	[01:45]	<ferronica>	stefg: right now i am in ubuntu 6.10 :(

[neutral]	[01:45]	<jrib>	!firewall > Christopherl    (Christopherl, see the private message from ubotu)
[neutral]	[01:46]	<Dextorion>	slackern: yup, /usr/lib/eclipse/startup.jar.
[negative]	[01:46]	<oktay>	tarzeau: yeah. for a while now.
[negative]	[01:46]	<ferronica>	stefg: i wanna use right now fstab
[neutral]	[01:46]	<tarzeau>	oktay: making packages too?
[negative]	[01:46]	<user-land>	you almost killed yourself, huffalump ?
[positive]	[01:46]	<foof>	thanks everyone!
[negative]	[01:46]	<Huffalump>	user-land, I think one should not have to reinstall.  That's generally the last resort of an impatient person not willing to reach out for help / learn a little something.
[negative]	[01:46]	<stefg>	ferronica: this is edgy... please read the link ubotu gave you
[positive]	[01:46]	<oktay>	tarzeau: no sir. i am just an end-user :)
[negative]	[01:46]	<Huffalump>	user-land, until this nvidia bug is solved for me, I am not to be allowed near razor blades.
[negative]	[01:46]	<slackern>	Dextorion: -rw-r--r--   1 root root 34173 2007-04-10 19:07 startup.jar there it is
[negative]	[01:46]	<user-land>	huffalump, how can you reach out when the computer does not boot to x-server ?
[positive]	[01:47]	<oktay>	tarzeau: i stopped messing with the OS too much when work got busy :). nowadays i just use the stuff.
[negative]	[01:47]	<ytsestef>	Firefox flash doesn't work!! and i cant install it from adobe becuase i'm on x64.. what can i do?
[negative]	[01:47]	<Dextorion>	slackern: yeah.. i dont have it anymore.  And it doesnt get installed together with eclipse.
[negative]	[01:47]	<slackern>	Dextorion: i could maybe upload it for you somewhere to try with if you want
[negative]	[01:47]	<tarzeau>	oktay: no time to play nethack?
[neutral]	[01:47]	<dfasfadsfdas>	anyone know the package name for adobe pdf and nonfree fonts addon in synaptic is?
[neutral]	[01:47]	<jrib>	!flash > ytsestef    (ytsestef, see the private message from ubotu)
[positive]	[01:47]	<Dextorion>	slackern: yeah..  could try :)  I bet there are more files missing but hey.. we could try
[neutral]	[01:47]	<CompuChip>	Hi.
[negative]	[01:47]	<spikeb>	ytsestef, you could use gnash, or you could install nspluginwrapper and try and work with that to make the x86 flash work
[negative]	[01:48]	<oktay>	tarzeau: not really. not even time for irc.
[neutral]	[01:48]	<tarzeau>	oktay: briquolo? brutalchess? supertransball2? mazeofgalious? pathogen? www.mtp-target.org? bub-n-bros.sf.net?
[negative]	[01:48]	<Huffalump>	user-land, good point.  I am fortunate enough to have a second machine where I'm writing from at the moment.  Seems to me, however, that there's been line-command IRC since the olden times... not that I know how to use it, but I've seen it.  Maybe a quick refresher is in order before you head down the primrose path?  Just in case of any unpleasantries, of course.
[neutral]	[01:48]	<xplode_me>	hi! After i upgraded to feisty (from edgy) gnome is going crazy. I have some applications on the startup list (gnome-session-properties) but they only show up minutes later. Anyone knows how to fix this?
[neutral]	[01:48]	<Tom47>	dfasfadsfdas: try the search function
[positive]	[01:48]	<ytsestef>	thanks spikeb and jrib!
[negative]	[01:48]	<slackern>	Dextorion: i'll just zip the folder so you get all in it
[positive]	[01:48]	<spikeb>	ytsestef, you bet :)
[positive]	[01:48]	<Dextorion>	slackern: cool :)
[negative]	[01:49]	<user-land>	thanks, huffalump, you may have saved me a day downtime. i have nvidia.
[negative]	[01:49]	<CompuChip>	"I was updating from Edgy to Feisty  when my laptop overheated and shut down. Now when I start up in recovery mode, it says ""Waiting for root system"" and then tells me /dev/hda2 (where it is installed) does not exist and drops to a (initramfs) shell. Any solutions except reinstall completely?"
[negative]	[01:49]	<DjViper>	how do I make ubuntu connect to a default wlan when I boot up?
[neutral]	[01:49]	<Huffalump>	user-land, -> @HLINK
[positive]	[01:49]	<jono>	people of the world, go and digg @HLINK :)
[negative]	[01:50]	<yellow_chicken>	i have 6.10 and applied all the updates, now i have 2 kernel versions, 2.6.17-10 and 2.6.17-11.  should i use -11 to upgrade to ubuntu 7.04?
[positive]	[01:50]	<bimberi>	jono: only when you buy me that pint! ;P
[negative]	[01:50]	<spikeb>	yellow_chicken, yeah probably
[positive]	[01:50]	<jono>	bimberi: :)
[neutral]	[01:50]	<yellow_chicken>	but the default is 2.6.10
[positive]	[01:50]	<spikeb>	yellow_chicken, i dont think it will matter what you're actually running as long as both are installed.
[neutral]	[01:50]	<user-land>	thanks, huffalump, so i will wait.
[neutral]	[01:50]	<DjViper>	jono: dugg
[negative]	[01:51]	<atomiku>	Hmmm Restricted Drivers Manager is complaining that it needs some linux-kernel module, but when I try to apt-get install it, it says it has no installation candidate
[neutral]	[01:51]	<CompuChip>	yellow_chicken after upgrading to -11 it set that to default here
[negative]	[01:51]	<yellow_chicken>	anyone did a upgrade? if so how long did it take?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<spikeb>	probably take forever over the net  given the pounding the servers are getting.
[positive]	[01:52]	<yellow_chicken>	i think it's very congested at this time
[neutral]	[01:52]	<spikeb>	yes it is.
[negative]	[01:52]	<Anss1>	How do I highlight rows with my nick or special keywords in Gaim/Pidgin?
[negative]	[01:52]	<ubuntu_noob>	hello, how do I fix error: *** SDL_image has no PNG support! You need SDL_image with PNG support?
[negative]	[01:52]	<DjViper>	how do I make ubuntu connect to a default wlan when I boot up?
[negative]	[01:52]	<zaggynl>	Anyone knows a now playing plugin for xchat2 ? I can't find it :<
[neutral]	[01:52]	<Anss1>	...which is the Edgy default IRC client.
[neutral]	[01:52]	<CompuChip>	Re my problem: when I boot from Live CD I *can* mount /dev/hda2 manually, through the shell I get when booting from HDD doesn't show anything starting with hda under /dev
[negative]	[01:52]	<spikeb>	hmm
[negative]	[01:52]	<atomiku>	E: Package linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic has no installation candidate
[negative]	[01:52]	<atomiku>	Hmm?
[negative]	[01:52]	<rashid>	how do i install java version 6
[negative]	[01:52]	<spikeb>	Anss1, that used to be in preferences, but it might have moved to a plugin.
[negative]	[01:53]	<yellow_chicken>	spikeb:  i did a fresh install of 6.10, and have to update 165 packages, took like 30 to 40 minutes
[positive]	[01:53]	<user-land>	all the best, huffalump.
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Valstorm2379>	anyone in?
[negative]	[01:53]	<Anss1>	spikeb, I looked through the plugins, to no available.
[negative]	[01:53]	<enry>	the video in internet are all framed

[negative]	[01:53]	<spikeb>	hmm
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Valstorm2379>	Anyone know a USB format program that runs through Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jrib>	atomiku: what version of ubuntu?
[negative]	[01:53]	<spikeb>	Anss1, im not sure then. i hate using gaim for irc heh
[positive]	[01:53]	<atomiku>	7
[neutral]	[01:53]	<enry>	wowww
[negative]	[01:53]	<atomiku>	I'm trying to get my nvidia drivers working again you see
[negative]	[01:53]	<jrib>	atomiku: that package isn't on 7.04.  Why are you installing it?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	Well
[neutral]	[01:54]	<verb3k>	guys my brother's CD/DVD reader is old and extremely slow ....is there a faster way to install ubuntu without downloading the alternate CD ? Thanks in advance
[negative]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	Im trying to get into the Restricted Drivers manager thing
[neutral]	[01:54]	<Valstorm2379>	Also, anyone remember the link for packages/software I can't remember it.
[neutral]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	its saying it needs that package to run
[neutral]	[01:54]	<eifzon>	!nvidia-drivers
[negative]	[01:54]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia-drivers - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:54]	<gilnim>	hello
[negative]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	yeah
[negative]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	Ive tried installing the nvidia drivers
[neutral]	[01:54]	<bimberi>	Valstorm2379: packages.ubuntu.com ?
[negative]	[01:54]	<Anss1>	Well spikeb, as an Linux trainer and consultant, I hate that people can not trust the default programs.
[negative]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	But then X fails to start
[negative]	[01:54]	<jrib>	atomiku: hmm, sounds buggy... can you pastebin the exact error?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	Well
[positive]	[01:54]	<Valstorm2379>	sweet thanks
[positive]	[01:54]	<Valstorm2379>	:D
[negative]	[01:54]	<atomiku>	X is saying it couldnt load the nvidia drivers
[negative]	[01:55]	<ubuntu_noob>	hello, how do I fix error: *** SDL_image has no PNG support! You need SDL_image with PNG support?
[negative]	[01:55]	<atomiku>	so atm I'm using the default xorg.conf
[positive]	[01:55]	<spikeb>	Anss1, gaim/pidgin weren't designed particularly for IRC. if i were in charge, xchat would be the default client :)
[negative]	[01:55]	<gilnim>	does someone know a restorationtool for getting back information from a formatted harddisk?
[positive]	[01:55]	<jrib>	ubuntu_noob: what gives you that error?

[negative]	[01:55]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about restore - try searching on @HLINK
[positive]	[01:56]	<atomiku>	As of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) the recommended way to install the binary drivers is to use System -> Administration -> Restricted Devices Manager.
[neutral]	[01:56]	<ubuntu_noob>	jrib, when compiling wesntoh
[negative]	[01:56]	<atomiku>	Now how am I going to do tjhis if I cant get into restricted devices manager?
[negative]	[01:56]	<jrib>	ubuntu_noob: why compile?  It's in the repositories, use Add/Remove or Synaptic

[positive]	[01:57]	<BrokenLinux>	Hey can anyone recommend me a nice IRC client besides xchat-gnome and gAIM?

[negative]	[02:05]	<orbin>	kaiyang: my reading of that is you're no more or less secure.  it's just optimized for servers which are sometimes low specced.
[neutral]	[02:05]	<crolle17>	jrib lots of help-txt-files...
[neutral]	[02:05]	<Maximilian1st>	sorcerer,  make your file executable chmod +x quake4

[positive]	[02:08]	<hobe>	Can I expect my internet connection (ADSL with Alcatel Speedtouch 330) to work ater upgrading to feisty? I mean after the upgrade to dapper, the firmware directory had changed. Is there anything similar to expect?

[negative]	[02:10]	<CompuChip>	ikonia_ :( so just make a fresh install and then try the upgrade again
[negative]	[02:10]	<Maximilian1st>	sorcerer, You need to give the full name of the app you want to make executable with chmod +x

[neutral]	[02:11]	<Maximilian1st>	sorcerer, you need to be in the same folder as the file.

[negative]	[02:11]	<ikonia_>	CompuChip you can't put /etc on a seperate partition
[negative]	[02:11]	<Mikhael>	ferronica: install ntfs3g if you wanna write NTFS partitions
[neutral]	[02:11]	<kelvin>	any networking EXPERT around??? from the 1300 peoples?
[neutral]	[02:11]	<NessieLiberation>	!ntfs-3g | ferronica

[neutral]	[02:14]	<ikonia_>	NessieLiberation I know this - but he's not using that
[negative]	[02:14]	<Trist_an>	ferronica, then you should restrat under windows and grap the files from it maybe
[neutral]	[02:14]	<CompuChip>	ikonia_: thanks, I'll do that.
[negative]	[02:14]	<NessieLiberation>	ikonia_: ok

[neutral]	[02:15]	<CompuChip>	ferronica, which data?
[negative]	[02:15]	<Stromberg>	hi i have problems installing the nvidia drivers. should i just do apt-get install nvidia-glx and it should work?
[negative]	[02:15]	<ryanakca>	Anybody know what the package for ACE is? @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:15]	<Trist_an>	ferronica, there is with ntfs-3g but...

[neutral]	[02:15]	<orbin>	ferronica: @HLINK
[negative]	[02:15]	<NessieLiberation>	ferronica: use an external HD with FAT partitions, or use ntfs-3g
[neutral]	[02:15]	<Stromberg>	i do sudo nvidia-glx-config enable then and after that X wont start anymore

[positive]	[02:16]	<bimberi>	BrokenLinux: you can modify mirrors via synaptic but probably the easiest way is to edity /etc/apt/sources.list directly
[neutral]	[02:16]	<magnetron>	!nvidia > Stromberg
[negative]	[02:16]	<orbin>	ferronica: then you can read the ext3 partitions from windows

[neutral]	[02:16]	<bimberi>	"BrokenLinux: 'gksudo ""gedit /etc/apt/sources.list""'"
[negative]	[02:16]	<CompuChip>	ferronica I made a separate fat partition for that: windows will automatically find it and in Ubuntu you can mount it under /data or whatever you like
[negative]	[02:16]	<Trist_an>	so do I CompuChip
[neutral]	[02:16]	<ikonia_>	CompuChip that would be his best solution, I agree
[negative]	[02:17]	<CompuChip>	Only problem is you will lose data when you want to do that after your installation
[neutral]	[02:17]	<Trist_an>	sorcerer, when done double click again on the file
[negative]	[02:17]	<CompuChip>	unless you use an external hard disk
[neutral]	[02:17]	<ikonia_>	sorcerer just read the docs - it tells you all this
[negative]	[02:17]	<yag4mi>	well, with feisty folk who have old nvidia cards are being left out of the beryl loop- but then again, its a pain to have beryl running on lesser powerful graphics cards, irrespective of how cool it looks.
[neutral]	[02:17]	<ikonia_>	yag4mi you don't have to use beryl
[negative]	[02:17]	<BrokenLinux>	bimberi: ok, that worked...so I just replace @HLINK with another mirror I find?
[negative]	[02:17]	<ikonia_>	yag4mi fesity is nothing to do with your card being too old to run new software
[neutral]	[02:17]	<yag4mi>	i know- ikonia - but it was nice while it lasted on edgy

[negative]	[02:18]	<yag4mi>	ikonia, is it possible using the previous release of the nvidia driver?
[negative]	[02:18]	<ikonia_>	yag4mi I'd advise against it
[neutral]	[02:19]	<ikonia_>	yag4mi try the nvidia-legacy package
[neutral]	[02:19]	<yag4mi>	i have nvidia-glx-legacy. and its possible to use beryl with it?
[negative]	[02:19]	<yag4mi>	(if so, woo hoo).
[neutral]	[02:19]	<Trist_an>	sorcerer, is it working now?
[positive]	[02:19]	<ikonia_>	yag4mi it will run, but how well is debatable
[neutral]	[02:19]	<sorcerer>	Trist_an:  umm mate .. that line is giving issues ..

[neutral]	[02:23]	<yellow_chicken>	anyone upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04? any problems in the way?

[negative]	[02:23]	<sorcerer>	i mean yeah its a flavour of linux .. but its ubuntu and besides peopel who switch from windows .. dontr know linux file systems .. and managment ..
[neutral]	[02:23]	<RARCA>	hdxx thx
[neutral]	[02:23]	<sorcerer>	Trist_an:  sorcerer
[positive]	[02:23]	<CompuChip>	sorcerer do you call the Microsoft help desk when you try to install a program that was ported from Linux and is potentially unstable in Windows? :)
[positive]	[02:23]	<yag4mi>	that'll usually give all the available usb disk devices.
[negative]	[02:23]	<apo_>	Hm... any ideas why traceroute6 tells me that a host is unknown while ping6 has no problems?
[negative]	[02:23]	<Valstorm2379>	I mean a USB memory stick. sigh.
[neutral]	[02:23]	<Dropbear>	Upgrade broke my system
[negative]	[02:23]	<bimberi>	ap1: hmm, somehow I don't think @HLINK is quite what you're after

[negative]	[02:24]	<Valstorm2379>	I mean sudo fdisk /media?
[neutral]	[02:24]	<Trist_an>	then sorcerer type sudo chown sorcerer:sorcerer quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run
[neutral]	[02:24]	<Wanderer>	anyone know the package names for Thunderbird 2?  No package updtes so far
[neutral]	[02:24]	<ikonia_>	Valstorm2379 /media is not a disk device
[neutral]	[02:24]	<ikonia_>	Wanderer what version of ubuntu
[neutral]	[02:24]	<Supaplex>	Valstorm2379: fdisk needs a block device.
[negative]	[02:24]	<sorcerer>	CompuChip: no mate i dont even bother .. dont get me wrong .. i am glad this channel exists .. but .. come one .. not many people wanna write commands to get apps working .. i love ubuntu .. and linux .. well its diffcult but a good challenge
[neutral]	[02:24]	<yag4mi>	no, Valstorm2379 - that is actually the mount point. in linux, the physical device reference is at another location
[neutral]	[02:24]	<BrokenLinux>	bimberi: check this out, @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:24]	<Wanderer>	ikonia: feisty, thunderbird 1.5 is installed
[neutral]	[02:25]	<yag4mi>	which usually is, /dev/somedevice
[negative]	[02:25]	<ikonia_>	Wanderer there is no thunderbird 2 yet
[negative]	[02:25]	<ap1>	bimberi and boojit: no, those references do not cut it. They do not tell about new features in a compact document.
[neutral]	[02:25]	<Valstorm2379>	ahh
[neutral]	[02:25]	<Wanderer>	ikonia_: ok released, not ported and packaged.  thanks
[positive]	[02:25]	<ikonia_>	Wanderer spot on
[neutral]	[02:25]	<Valstorm2379>	How would I find out the physical ref?
[neutral]	[02:25]	<Valstorm2379>	any quick command for it?
[neutral]	[02:25]	<yag4mi>	i told you earlier. type : ls /dev/sd*
[negative]	[02:25]	<bimberi>	BrokenLinux: yes i've seen that.  Wasn't sure if it would give you a wide choice of mirrors though.
[positive]	[02:25]	<Valstorm2379>	kay thanks
[positive]	[02:25]	<Wanderer>	ikonia_: thanks for the straight answer :.
[positive]	[02:26]	<ikonia_>	Wanderer a pleasure to have someone want a straight answer
[negative]	[02:26]	<boojit>	apl: well GEE sorry man. Maybe your lack of description in your original question is what doesn't cut it, not the link.
[neutral]	[02:26]	<ProN00b>	hay, giev update howto teh now ke ?!?!!
[positive]	[02:26]	<Hasrat_USA>	good morning. what's the command for finding out the release number of an Ubuntu distribution?

[neutral]	[02:26]	<taggie>	"valstorm2379: plug in the usb, and type ""dmesg"" look at the last few lines for the /dev/sdX"
[neutral]	[02:26]	<yellow_chicken>	does upgrade remove old open office? or just install a new instance and link to new path
[neutral]	[02:27]	<ikonia_>	yellow_chicken it upgrades
[negative]	[02:27]	<Terminus>	hello. i just installed feisty and sound isn't working. kernel modules are loaded (snd_emu10k1) but i'm not getting any output. anybody know how to fix this? previously worked in dapper.
[negative]	[02:27]	<sorcerer>	Trist_an:  did you get my message ?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<LjL>	ap1: perhaps @HLINK ?
[positive]	[02:27]	<boubbin>	how to install nvidia-legacy drivers in feisty (kubuntu) ? adept wont find legacy drivers
[negative]	[02:27]	<ap1>	I mean, I am looking for a document which allows me to weigh the benefit of Feisty upgrade compared to the trouble of possible new bugs.
[neutral]	[02:27]	<IdleOne>	!nvidia
[neutral]	[02:27]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[negative]	[02:27]	<Trist_an>	sorcerer, nope. Are you a registered user?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<ikonia_>	boubbin do you haev the correct repo enabled
[negative]	[02:27]	<LjL>	sorcerer: the command line is not that hard, when you've got documents to follow step by step. they tell you to type some thing, and you type said thing. that's it. if you encounter problems, *then* ask. (but remember we can't thorougly support 3rd party products)
[neutral]	[02:27]	<Hasrat_USA>	 the upgrade upgrades openoffice to 2.2
[neutral]	[02:27]	<boubbin>	ikonia_: how to enable it in feisty ?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<yellow_chicken>	Terminus: did you update all the packages on 6.10 before you upgrade to 7.04?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<sorcerer>	Trist_an:  here is the link @HLINK ..
[neutral]	[02:28]	<ikonia_>	boubbin the same as in every other ubuntu release
[neutral]	[02:28]	<sorcerer>	LjL:  aight mate ..

[negative]	[02:28]	<RARCA>	I am having problems accessing the web from Ubuntu.  I can access google.com and no other sites.  Any suggestions?  It seems the bundled chat client can connect to the net.
[positive]	[02:28]	<Terminus>	yellow_chicken: this is a fresh feisty install.
[negative]	[02:28]	<yag4mi>	yeah, nice feature they've added this time- the software management.
[positive]	[02:29]	<bimberi>	BrokenLinux: cool, np :)
[negative]	[02:29]	<Trist_an>	hey ikonia he (sorcerer) cannot sudo chown the file....
[neutral]	[02:29]	<LjL>	sorcerer: is that file located on an NTFS (or Windows, anyway) filesystem?
[positive]	[02:29]	<yag4mi>	but still, it'd be nicer if ubuntu had something that runs similar to source-o-matic natively.
[negative]	[02:29]	<bulmer>	RARCA: what do you mean only google.com? can you ping the other sites?
[neutral]	[02:29]	<sorcerer>	ohh shit guys .

[neutral]	[02:29]	<ubotu>	Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[neutral]	[02:29]	<RARCA>	when I ping other sites it does not bounce back.
[negative]	[02:29]	<sorcerer>	my bad sorry
[neutral]	[02:29]	<ap1>	RARCA, are you on a FON WLAN AP? They allow only Google by default...
[neutral]	[02:29]	<magnetron>	!ohmy > sorcerer
[neutral]	[02:29]	<yellow_chicken>	Terminus: the instruction on ubuntu says you need to update all the packages for feisty first before upgrade to 7.04
[neutral]	[02:29]	<LjL>	sorcerer: move it to your home directory first.  mv quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run ~/ 
[positive]	[02:29]	<CompuChip>	700 MB @ 500 kb/s takes a long time :)
[neutral]	[02:30]	<jimwhimpey>	I had to restart my Ubuntu box which is entirely controlled via ssh on another computer, I've rebooted in the past and had it restart with ssh fine before but this time I've restarted it and I can't connect via ssh. I also accidentally deleted the GUI so I can't really just hook up a screen, get it running and then get rid of the screen again. What can I do?
[negative]	[02:30]	<do7>	i have a version of ubuntu running on a cd.how do i save it to run without cd on my pc
[neutral]	[02:30]	<feNNec_>	Hi !

[neutral]	[02:30]	<yellow_chicken>	Terminus: @HLINK
[positive]	[02:30]	<Terminus>	yellow_chicken: this isn't an upgrade. it's a fresh install off the feisty alt cd.
[negative]	[02:30]	<LjL>	sorcerer: then  cd ~ , then again  sudo chown sorcerer:sorcerer  quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run

[neutral]	[02:31]	<CompuChip>	jimwhimpey you deleted the GUI but you can still log in through a terminal, right?
[negative]	[02:31]	<JebJoya>	okay, noone was talking in there last time :S
[negative]	[02:31]	<plux>	jimwhimpey: hook up a screen to it and use the terminalinterface (you will be greeted by something similiar you see when you do ssh)
[positive]	[02:31]	<do7>	ikonia_ thanks
[neutral]	[02:31]	<yellow_chicken>	Terminus: feisty was beta for so long, i got mixed up. i took feisty as edgy
[neutral]	[02:31]	<CompuChip>	jimwhimpey so just hook up a screen and log in
[neutral]	[02:31]	<feNNec_>	Edgy -> Feisty upgrade pb: update manager doesn't give the cell to upgrade
[negative]	[02:31]	<ikonia_>	TmsK for the record I personally don't believe dmraid is worth while at this time
[positive]	[02:31]	<TmsK>	its supported in the installer?
[positive]	[02:31]	<yag4mi>	JebJoya, yeah - thats assuming they are around :P

[positive]	[02:31]	<ikonia_>	wamty personal taste
[neutral]	[02:31]	<rukuartic>	Does anyone know why ctrl+alt+backspace reboots instead of restarting XOrg like it used to?
[positive]	[02:31]	<magnetron>	!best > wamty
[positive]	[02:32]	<VSpike>	does the bot do !advocacy ? :)
[negative]	[02:32]	<CompuChip>	jimwhimpey yes, like plux said. And if not, you can press Ctrl + Alt + F1 and then you should.
[neutral]	[02:32]	<VSpike>	!advocacy
[negative]	[02:32]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about advocacy - try searching on @HLINK

[positive]	[02:32]	<taggie>	"wamty xubuntu tends to be faster on older/slower boxes, but ""better"" is a very subjective thing."

[neutral]	[02:32]	<wamty>	are there sepcial video cards for xgl support?
[positive]	[02:32]	<yag4mi>	i prefer the best apps from different DEs.

[negative]	[02:33]	<sorcerer>	Trist_an:  hey mate .. sudo cho worked in the terminal .. now whats to run the thing now ?
[negative]	[02:33]	<JebJoya>	"yag4mi:  the issue seems to be kinda feisty based, since if i try sudo apt-get install python-qt3 i get: ""right, i've got some issues, first things first - Amarok will not install, I get an issue stating ""amarok: Depends: python-qt3 but it is not going to be installed"" any fixes?"""

[negative]	[02:47]	<finalbeta_>	jrib: I would have to reboot for that. The default program doesn't even start anymore, I made it lock up. I killed it, don't know what's keeping it from working now. Anyway, I don't want to use the default one. It simply doesn't work ok.
[positive]	[02:47]	<ikonia_>	SandMan because people don't listen

[negative]	[03:21]	<rohan>	should i file a bug for the synaptics touchpad not automatically being detected issue ?
[positive]	[03:22]	<giddion55>	hove come this is the most popular channel on the server?
[neutral]	[03:22]	<PriceChild>	kleftisx, sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[negative]	[03:22]	<Huffalump>	Masqy, I think you want to look into GnomeMeeting
[neutral]	[03:22]	<giddion55>	is unbuto good?
[positive]	[03:22]	<zaggynl>	giddion55, because, ubuntu is getting quite a bit of attention.

[positive]	[03:25]	<PriceChild>	CompuChip, so that you don't just go round randomly typing commands
[neutral]	[03:25]	<Huffalump>	Masqy, technically GnomeMeeting works with all the standards-compliant video chat tools... including Microsoft's NetMeeting (which is default on Windows, yes)
[neutral]	[03:25]	<CheesyJedi>	Dekkard: it's quicktime (on apple's trailer site I get the same error)

[negative]	[03:43]	<PirateHead>	jijutm: first, make a backup of your corrupted database so the apt team can look at it. It might be useful in debugging apt?
[neutral]	[03:43]	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: I need the output from `bash alsa-info.sh --with-all`

[neutral]	[03:43]	<PirateHead>	Masqy: do you have the latest version of the update manager?

[negative]	[04:02]	<PirateHead>	crimsun: the change somehow made things worse. Rather than having a recognized sound card that inexplicably doesn't play sound, now it swears that there is no sound device.
[neutral]	[04:03]	<johnnybuoy>	DeadCowboy, do you have a 64bit version of feisty?
[neutral]	[04:03]	<Bsims>	ie on upgrade

[negative]	[04:03]	<orbin>	_dennis_: you can't make a partition out of the free space?

[negative]	[04:54]	<h0ax>	scapy i dunno how to install it =/
[negative]	[04:55]	<soundray>	atomiku: then you have to chroot your root partition first. What's the /dev name of your root?
[negative]	[04:55]	<Pici>	h0ax: No, there isnt.
[negative]	[04:55]	<jrib>	surviver: mkdir ~/.devilspie         ~ expands to /home/surviver automatically.  I'll be afk for a bit so ask the channel if you still need help
[neutral]	[04:55]	<stefg>	atomiku: so mount your partiton and chroot to it
[negative]	[04:55]	<Scapy>	and you wanna exploit systems ? hehe
[neutral]	[04:55]	<h0ax>	no never
[neutral]	[04:55]	<h0ax>	*rolls eyes*
[negative]	[04:55]	<atomiku>	soundray: hmm... /dev/hda8
[neutral]	[04:55]	<eck>	neighborlee: you need apt-file
[neutral]	[04:55]	<atomiku>	by the way
[negative]	[04:55]	<Adyeths>	ok... how about this question.... how can I safely CANCEL an upgrade thats running from the alternate install cd?
[positive]	[04:55]	<berent>	jrib : the fluorescent green is still there in all available schemes

[negative]	[04:56]	<h0ax>	for sex or ....
[neutral]	[04:56]	<stefg>	atomiku: so mount /proc (/sys ?) in the chroot and mount hda1 /in the chroot/ then
[negative]	[04:56]	<imon9>	soundry: how did u know it is /dev/ttyUSB0 and not /dev/ttyUSB1 or 2 or 3?
[positive]	[04:56]	<Scapy>	no im straight :)
[neutral]	[04:56]	<jshriver>	hrm reconfiguring X doesnt work..
[neutral]	[04:56]	<atomiku>	soundray: done

[neutral]	[04:56]	<michael>	is anyone else having trouble with apt-get connecting to the servers?
[negative]	[04:56]	<soundray>	atomiku: reboot and check if it worked
[neutral]	[04:56]	<h0ax>	can*
[negative]	[04:56]	<eck>	Adyeths: whether or not you can safely cancel depends on how far along in the install you are...
[neutral]	[04:56]	<atomiku>	soundray: but?
[neutral]	[04:57]	<webby>	hi I need some help
[negative]	[04:57]	<Tom47>	seanh have you looked at planner?
[negative]	[04:57]	<atomiku>	wasnt I supposed to apt-get the thingies
[neutral]	[04:57]	<webby>	I installed ubuntu for my grandma
[negative]	[04:57]	<webby>	didn't want to deal with windows
[negative]	[04:57]	<Adyeths>	eck: its busying downloading packages from the net. (which I was trying to avoid by using the alternate install cd in the first place)
[negative]	[04:57]	<soundray>	atomiku: you didn't read my lines carefully
[positive]	[04:57]	<webby>	so it installed fine, we hooked her up to the internet
[negative]	[04:57]	<Huffalump2>	webby, what's the problem?
[positive]	[04:57]	<Kaur>	using feisty and dpkg gives: Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs....dpkg: error processing ca-certificates (--configure):
[neutral]	[04:57]	<Krazytekn0>	toolee, the root password is the password you set up for the first user, you can't log into root in ubuntu
[neutral]	[04:57]	<soundray>	atomiku: 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-2.6.20-15-generic'
[neutral]	[04:57]	<webby>	they gave us an IP address
[neutral]	[04:57]	<Kaur>	What to do?
[positive]	[04:57]	<webby>	it sees it works, and goes to the ISP page
[neutral]	[04:57]	<webby>	you need a dialer
[neutral]	[04:57]	<Pici>	!enter | webby
[negative]	[04:57]	<ubotu>	"webby: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the ""Enter"" key as punctuation!"
[neutral]	[04:57]	<bropenguin>	hello
[negative]	[04:57]	<jshriver>	wtf is pango?
[positive]	[04:57]	<atomiku>	soundray: thank you
[neutral]	[04:57]	<bropenguin>	anyone here
[neutral]	[04:57]	<soundray>	atomiku: don't forget to mount your /boot partition
[positive]	[04:57]	<Huffalump2>	webby, what's the problem?  just spit it out :] 
[negative]	[04:57]	<Adyeths>	my plan was to upgrade from the cd. apparently the cd had other plans though.
[neutral]	[04:57]	<webby>	this worked for windows. but here the dialer doesn't have an installer.
[neutral]	[04:57]	<atomiku>	soundray: mount it where?
[neutral]	[04:58]	<soundray>	atomiku: what stefg said
[neutral]	[04:58]	<webby>	it's a tar.gz. file, extracated it's 3 files without extentions.
[neutral]	[04:58]	<soundray>	atomiku: in the chroot
[positive]	[04:58]	<Tom47>	seanh you can also achieve a lot with calendar in evolution
[negative]	[04:58]	<jshriver>	How do you specify language for X?
[positive]	[04:58]	<stefg>	atomiku: if you are lucky you have an older kernel to boot... if the installed system won't boot, then you have to proceed as i said...
[negative]	[04:58]	<eck>	Adyeths: if it hasn't installed anything yet you can probably safely quit... the thing that you don't want to do is cancel apt while it is installing the packages and possibly leave them in an inconsistent state
[negative]	[04:58]	<webby>	how can I install it?! no instructions anywhere.
[negative]	[04:58]	<busfahrer>	Excuse me, is it possible to boot another distro that you already have installed, then mount the ubuntu ISO, and run the installer script to install ubuntu into another partition on that computer?
[positive]	[04:58]	<soundray>	jshriver: System-Admin-Language Support
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Huffalump2>	webby, what specifically did you download?
[neutral]	[04:58]	<atomiku>	soundray: well okay lets just see if it works
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Krazytekn0>	!keepyouranswersusefull | Pici
[negative]	[04:59]	<atomiku>	thigns are just confusing since on one partition i only have a boot folder with grub in it
[positive]	[04:59]	<soundray>	busfahrer: no, but what you want can be achieved in a different way. Read the private message from ubotu
[neutral]	[04:59]	<stefg>	!install | busfahrer
[positive]	[04:59]	<ubotu>	busfahrer: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see @HLINK for documentation. Problems during install? See @HLINK and @HLINK - See also !automate
[neutral]	[04:59]	<webby>	from the ISP page there are dialer downloads. for windows its an .exe
[neutral]	[04:59]	<soundray>	!install > busfahrer
[neutral]	[04:59]	<eck>	busfahrer: if you have a debian install you can use debootstrap, if not you can put the iso contetns on another partition and boot them with grub
[negative]	[04:59]	<toolee>	"HI, i use the ""alternate ISO"" install 7.04,but i can't get the root 'password.how can i do?"
[negative]	[04:59]	<Adyeths>	ok, how do I cancel when there isn't an option to cancel the upgrade? No option to close the window thats telling me whats going on with the upgrade either?
[negative]	[04:59]	<atomiku>	and thats the partition it boots from, grub sets the kernel's root to /dev/hda8
[neutral]	[04:59]	<webby>	for linux its a tar.gz with just 3 files in it. hold on I'll list it.
[positive]	[04:59]	<jshriver>	which icon is language? can't see menu lol
[neutral]	[04:59]	<toolee>	help me
[negative]	[04:59]	<Huffalump2>	webby, you may have to ask the ISP for help.  But please continue, just in case.
[negative]	[04:59]	<faloos>	I am wanting to shift from suse to ubuntu, is it possible without loosing all my previous data?
[neutral]	[04:59]	<webby>	sure, one sec. and thanks.
[negative]	[04:59]	<Pici>	!root > toolee  (please see the pm from ubotu)
[positive]	[04:59]	<eck>	Adyeths: if you switch to one of the VTs it is logging the current operations of the installer and you might be able to tell if its safe to stop
[positive]	[04:59]	<atomiku>	brb seeing if it works
[positive]	[05:00]	<Tom47>	faloos in about as many ways as its possible to skin a cat
[neutral]	[05:00]	<webby>	(I'm not actually there, my dad is there and he's on the phone)
[negative]	[05:00]	<goldbond>	hey,when i try to upgrade the process freezes at 65/73 files? is this because the servers are busy?
[positive]	[05:00]	<Tom47>	faloos the short answer is yes
[negative]	[05:00]	<Krazytekn0>	Too all the people just making the bot do their work, you actually aren't helping anyone. If these people didn't know how to use the website and all the things the bot refers to, they WOULDN'T BE HERE
[positive]	[05:00]	<Krazytekn0>	you are just adding to their confusion
[neutral]	[05:00]	<faloos>	all my data is in the /home directory
[neutral]	[05:01]	<ikonia_>	Krazytekn0 lots of people are helping, but the bot is causing a lot of flood
[neutral]	[05:01]	<jessid>	!alternate
[neutral]	[05:01]	<webby>	Huffalump2: cstart, cstop, ppt-linux
[negative]	[05:01]	<cyris>	i'm getting a tone of errors when im updating my repositories, connection refused. is that because the servers are busy ?
[negative]	[05:01]	<gpled>	what does ubuntu have a hard time with flat screens?
[neutral]	[05:01]	<webby>	those are the 3 files there
[negative]	[05:01]	<soundray>	Krazytekn0: if you cared to spend a little time here reading the questions, you would soon learn how massively wrong you are.
[positive]	[05:01]	<ubotu>	"The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an ""expert"" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a ""Live"" CD."
[neutral]	[05:01]	<gpled>	why
[negative]	[05:01]	<amro>	half the screen looks garbled when I set a certain resolution- I know it's supported and it worked for me under 6.10. What could be the problem?
[neutral]	[05:01]	<Tom47>	faloos you will want to back your data up
[negative]	[05:01]	<webby>	it looks like a bash shell
[negative]	[05:01]	<soundray>	Krazytekn0: there is a reason why people have created the bot, you know
[negative]	[05:01]	<Progressive>	well whoever had that problem with nforce and newest feisty, disable usb 2.0 and it starts working
[negative]	[05:02]	<Krazytekn0>	soundray, it's spam, and confusing people whereas useful answers do not
[neutral]	[05:02]	<ikonia_>	soundray he does have a sport of a point, some of ubots responses are 20 lines long and 3 people hit ubot and 60 lines are on screen
[neutral]	[05:02]	<ikonia_>	s/sport/sort
[neutral]	[05:02]	<vox754>	"Latest stable ""ndiswrapper"" is 1.42, get it from source"
[positive]	[05:02]	<Tom47>	faloos then you can install ubuntu in a separate set of partitions and then move you data around ... this is likely to be the most flexible approach ie have both ubuntu and sse insalled
[negative]	[05:02]	<jshriver>	here is a screenshot of what's wrong
[neutral]	[05:02]	<jshriver>	@HLINK
[negative]	[05:02]	<soundray>	ikonia_: that's why there's !goodbotuse
[positive]	[05:02]	<gpled>	7.04 is getting better. got the resolution and hz correct, but still missing the colors
[negative]	[05:02]	<Lowe>	how do i mount a memory-card in a card-reader?

[negative]	[05:02]	<ikonia_>	soundray I know, I wrote it !!! but people arn't using it
[negative]	[05:03]	<majd_>	Hey, i'm trying to change the port that open-ssh server listens to, i changed the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and restarted but that's not working

[neutral]	[05:03]	<jessid>	!screensaver

[negative]	[05:03]	<Woody_>	hello, i am on 7.04 Beta, how can I upgrade to 7.04 Final with my CD?
[positive]	[05:03]	<ikonia_>	soundray one of the reaons I love you is because you do use it
[neutral]	[05:03]	<webby>	./cstart outputs: cp:  unable to delete /sbin/ppt-linux
[negative]	[05:03]	<Adyeths>	ok... that tells me WHETHER its safe to stop the upgrade. That doesn't tell me HOW to stop the upgrade though.
[neutral]	[05:03]	<Lowe>	"then i insert he card i see ""tifm 7xx1: sd card detected in socket 3"" in the log"
[neutral]	[05:03]	<jessid>	!screen
[positive]	[05:03]	<ubotu>	screen is a terminal multiplexer. See @HLINK and @HLINK
[negative]	[05:03]	<stefg>	Krazytekn0: so start giving useful answers, instaed of insulting volunteers, who are not here to spoonfeed people, but to give them something to *learn*
[neutral]	[05:03]	<ikonia_>	Adyeths you can't stop the upgrade
[negative]	[05:03]	<nox-Hand>	mc44: Not going well :(
[negative]	[05:03]	<Huffalump2>	webby, wow.  I have no idea what that is, sorry.  I just spent a minute on google in hopes of a prompting... but nada.
[neutral]	[05:03]	<wastrel>	stefg:  actually we spoonfeed people plenty
[negative]	[05:03]	<eck>	majd_: check the logs to see if sshd had a problem binding to that port
[negative]	[05:03]	<tokyoahead>	hi guys.... how can I switch ubuntu 7.4 to use the screen resolution of 1280x800? /etc/x11/xorg.conf lists the resolution under screen section, but I cannot choose it on the screen resolution preferences....
[positive]	[05:03]	<ikonia_>	stefg the best response
[neutral]	[05:03]	<webby>	grep/what/lib/dhcp/dhclient -.linux no such file directory
[neutral]	[05:03]	<mc44>	nox-Hand: what happened?
[neutral]	[05:03]	<Huffalump2>	webby, what is the windows .exe file?
[negative]	[05:03]	<webby>	its just an installer
[neutral]	[05:04]	<majd_>	eck, where would i find the logs?
[positive]	[05:04]	<Adyeths>	thanks ikonia. that answers one of my questions.
[positive]	[05:04]	<eck>	majd_: although i would recommend just keeping it on port 22 and using ssh keys
[negative]	[05:04]	<amro>	half the screen looks garbled when I set a certain resolution- I know it's supported and it worked for me under 6.10. What could be the problem?
[positive]	[05:04]	<Krazytekn0>	stefg : i find that telling people to listen to this recording (read this by a bot) then go to the website does not promote learning, learning is achieved through interaction, not automation
[negative]	[05:04]	<eck>	majd_: it's either /var/log/messages or /var/log/auth.log
[neutral]	[05:04]	<majd_>	eck, so i can keep port 22 open on two computers and ssh into either of them?
[neutral]	[05:04]	<rysiek|pl>	guys, has anything got broken in feisty since beta as far as the i915 kernel module (for Intel's i94x gf cards) is concerned?
[negative]	[05:04]	<clop>	hi, fresh install of feisty x64; my /usr/src/linux directory is empty, what package do i need to get to get the kernel sources here?
[negative]	[05:04]	<Progressive>	Daverocks: ive fixed the problem, its with nforce usb 2.0, now it booted no problem.. (i disabled usb 2.0 in bios)
[neutral]	[05:04]	<Huffalump2>	And the function of this is like PPPoE dialer or ?
[negative]	[05:04]	<verb3k>	guys ...what's wrong with the medibuntu repositories ? they are extremely slow ....do you have the same problem or it's just my connection?
[neutral]	[05:04]	<webby>	yes
[neutral]	[05:04]	<soundray>	tokyoahead: you have to do a 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'. Ubotu will send you a private msg

[neutral]	[05:04]	<ubotu>	Krazytekn0: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[neutral]	[05:04]	<Daverocks>	Progressive: nice
[negative]	[05:04]	<webby>	exactly, it's just a dialer for a cable modem
[neutral]	[05:04]	<soundray>	!fixres > tokyoahead
[negative]	[05:04]	<eck>	majd_: you can do it with port forwarding, although at that point i guess you might as well run it on antoher port
[negative]	[05:04]	<Huffalump2>	ok
[positive]	[05:04]	<Krazytekn0>	stefg I spend many hours here helping people, and my answers get shoved out of the way by bot commands that say to go to the website
[negative]	[05:04]	<Adyeths>	the other question which I asked first was.... why didn't the alternate install cd us whats on the cd for the upgrade like the instructions said it would instead of download everything off the net?
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Adyeths>	use*
[negative]	[05:05]	<ikonia_>	Adyeths no idea
[negative]	[05:05]	<Progressive>	daverocks: who was this other guy, cuz he had a hanging system after usb check aswell and a nforce chipset aswell

[negative]	[05:05]	<eck>	majd_: if you are going to use more than one port, make sure you use .ssh/config so you don't have to suffer the indignity of specifying the port each time you connect

[negative]	[05:07]	<Adyeths>	it doesn't look like its downloading just documentation though. its downloading EVERYTHING. which is disappointing because the whole reason I chose to upgrade from the alternate install cd was to avoid the network congestion that was going on.
[negative]	[05:07]	<matt1982>	ahh tahts better got my nick back
[negative]	[05:07]	<ikonia_>	Krazytekn0 the installer/upgrader installs to the level its at ont he cd - then prompts to see if you want to connect tot he internet to update further

[neutral]	[05:08]	<Krazytekn0>	Adyeths, yes, I misspoke (mistyped?) I meant that what the docs say will happen and what actually happens are sometimes different
[negative]	[05:08]	<eck>	majd_: that is normal, it's all the script kiddies running scans on your network
[neutral]	[05:08]	<frederific>	Lowe, straight after you plug it it, run dmesg from a terminal

[negative]	[05:10]	<whatthefmanager>	Krazytekn0, not in the sudoers. But I want to know why gdm is not showing up, right after installing. How can I fix that? It is running
[positive]	[05:10]	<alex-weej>	babo: are you an ex-gentoo user? :P
[negative]	[05:10]	<mg___>	ikonia, ah ok. did they rename ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso to feisty-alternate-i386.iso because the hashes are identical
[negative]	[05:10]	<atomiku>	When ubuntu boots it takes me to some shell and mentions something about initramfs how can I fix this?

[positive]	[05:11]	<whatthefmanager>	Krazytekn0 thanks
[positive]	[05:12]	<hmpedersen>	soundray, thanks
[negative]	[05:12]	<yasser>	im getting a black screen on bootup...is there any way i can make ubuntu boot in verbose mode??
[negative]	[05:12]	<Krazytekn0>	CapaH what did you use to download before?
[negative]	[05:12]	<soundray>	CapaH: what do you want to do?

[negative]	[05:12]	<atomiku>	soundray: when ubuntu boots it takes me to some shell and mentions something about initramfs how can I fix this?
[negative]	[05:12]	<eck>	majd_: well it sounds like it is trying to associate with a host name that it can't lookup, but i haven't seen that error before so it could be something else
[negative]	[05:12]	<auTONYmous>	I'm having a problem with NTFS-3G on a USB drive
[neutral]	[05:12]	<atomiku>	I copied the /boot/ dir from my / partition to my boot partition
[positive]	[05:12]	<atomiku>	grub loaded fine.
[neutral]	[05:12]	<gpled>	how do you change screen color depth in 7.04?
[negative]	[05:12]	<Huffalump>	Can anyone point me in the correct direction to solve Failed to load module wfb after an upgrade to Feisty?
[negative]	[05:12]	<CapaH>	Krazytekn0: What I did, is I used firefox (DOH) to download 9/10ths of the file, and now I have a file that is 692,XXX bytes and I just need maybe another 100,000 bytes
[negative]	[05:12]	<Krazytekn0>	soundray I think CapaH is saying that he/she wants to resume downloading where they left off
[neutral]	[05:13]	<CapaH>	that is exactly what I am saying
[negative]	[05:13]	<yasser>	im getting a black screen on bootup...is there any way i can make ubuntu boot in verbose mode??
[negative]	[05:13]	<atomiku>	CapaH: cant be done
[neutral]	[05:13]	<atomiku>	you using firefox?
[positive]	[05:13]	<razzorz>	The D/L of the new distro... what will that do to my exsisting ???
[neutral]	[05:13]	<jrib>	"yasser: choose ""recovery mode"""
[neutral]	[05:13]	<soundray>	atomiku: it can't work that way. You have to chroot to the final setup with /boot mounted, then reinstall the image package.
[positive]	[05:13]	<CapaH>	Well I used firefox originally but I am welcome to use anything to get the last part of the file :)
[negative]	[05:13]	<razzorz>	i should say the Install
[negative]	[05:13]	<Pici>	K^Holtz: Probably, since thats not an official repository, they might not have a feisty section that exists.  I think you will be fine ignoring it.
[neutral]	[05:13]	<yasser>	jrib: then??
[negative]	[05:13]	<annihilus>	i am trying to install feisty form the desktop cd, intially i was getting an XServer error telling me No Screens Found, but now i cant even make it past Configuring Network Interfaces on bootup, anone have any ideas what is going on
[positive]	[05:13]	<Huffalump>	razzorz, it will upgrade it
[negative]	[05:13]	<eck>	atomiku: unmount /boot and remove /boot from /, otherwise you will have a hard time telling whree it is reading files from
[negative]	[05:13]	<atomiku>	soundray: okay so can you tell me how please if thats okay
[neutral]	[05:13]	<jrib>	yasser: then you will get messages while you bootup
[neutral]	[05:13]	<atomiku>	eck: not totally sure how
[positive]	[05:13]	<K^Holtz>	thanks Pici
[negative]	[05:14]	<Krazytekn0>	CapaH unfortunately firefox doesn't support download resuming, I would suggest you install a good download manager for these types of files, sorry to break the bad news
[negative]	[05:14]	<razzorz>	thats it.. .. just the upgrade.. the one off the ubuntu site
[neutral]	[05:14]	<soundray>	CapaH: you can continue the download with wget -c URL , where URL is the address you previously used in firefox
[neutral]	[05:14]	<majd_>	eck, well...is there a way for me to connect through port 23, but have that port forward the call to my local computer and mask it as port 22?
[negative]	[05:14]	<eternalswd>	"""update-manager -d"" isn't detecting distro upgrade.  I get a ""warning: could not initiate dbus"" message in the terminal. any ideas?"
[negative]	[05:14]	<atomiku>	nothing is really mounted at the moment, since im on the livecd
[negative]	[05:14]	<yasser>	jrib: so do i have to always boot using recovery mode!!??
[neutral]	[05:14]	<soundray>	atomiku: I told you before how to chroot.
[negative]	[05:14]	<yasser>	jrib: to avoid the black screen??
[negative]	[05:14]	<jrib>	yasser: no, but this will let you figure out what the problem is
[neutral]	[05:14]	<atomiku>	soundray: i forgot
[neutral]	[05:14]	<atomiku>	its not gonna be in the logs either
[neutral]	[05:14]	<eck>	atomiku: well if you just copied it over to a new partition you have the stuff in two places, you should only have it in one place
[positive]	[05:14]	<Rondom>	#ubuntu is 1337 :-)
[neutral]	[05:14]	<CapaH>	soundray: *Maybe* this will work (goes to try it) -- I just need to be in the same dir as the file I originally got right?
[negative]	[05:14]	<verb3k>	guys ...what's wrong with the medibuntu repositories ? they are extremely slow ....do you have the same problem or it's just my connection?
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Huffalump>	yasser, let me know if yours says Failed to load module wfb
[negative]	[05:14]	<soundray>	atomiku: that's your problem then. You can't ask me to repeat myself.
[negative]	[05:15]	<atomiku>	soundray: come on man
[neutral]	[05:15]	<soundray>	CapaH: yes
[negative]	[05:15]	<atomiku>	i thought it would have worked first time
[neutral]	[05:15]	<yasser>	jrib: i think the prob is the usplash.....its causing headaches to so many.........!
[negative]	[05:15]	<atomiku>	I cant even check my logs
[negative]	[05:15]	<eck>	majd_: usually you can configure the router to e.g. pass traffic on port 23 to 192.168.x.x on port y
[positive]	[05:15]	<Rug_>	verb3k: world + dog are hitting those servers, give it time
[neutral]	[05:15]	<Krazytekn0>	soundray, so wget will automatically know that firefox started the download?  I never knew this
[negative]	[05:15]	<jrib>	yasser: oh does ubuntu still load after the black screen?
[negative]	[05:15]	<soundray>	atomiku: next time use a pen and paper
[neutral]	[05:15]	<atomiku>	soundray: I shall
[neutral]	[05:15]	<soundray>	atomiku: 'sudo mount /dev/hda8 /mnt && sudo chroot /mnt/ bash'
[positive]	[05:15]	<verb3k>	Rug_: I think so......do you experience the same problem?
[negative]	[05:16]	<atomiku>	thank you. now what about /boot/ what do you want me to do with it?
[positive]	[05:16]	<pipak>	hello :) I have a little question: could anyone point me to a good lightweight IDE to program in perl (no emacs and such for me)?
[neutral]	[05:16]	<valerie>	hello can anyone help please?
[negative]	[05:16]	<valerie>	"i have a problem with wine when i do wine dvdshrink.exe i get an error from wine telling me ""set up was unable to create the directory "" C:Windows\is-BTU2T.temp""  error 3. path not found"
[negative]	[05:16]	<jshriver>	"When I try to load a program I get a lot of crap about ""pango"""
[negative]	[05:16]	<Rug_>	verb3k: nope, I haven't upgraded yet.  I won't upgrade for awhile.    I don't need to
[negative]	[05:16]	<jshriver>	I did a search and that seems to be an internationalized language package? How do I revert back to English
[positive]	[05:16]	<eck>	majd_: i think it is sometimes called port triggering by the router
[neutral]	[05:17]	<Huffalump>	pipak, I think Bluefish does perl
[neutral]	[05:17]	<yasser>	jrib: it did not initially....but when i added vga=0x311 and splash=silent....i see the gdm after 33 sec
[positive]	[05:17]	<verb3k>	Rug_: I see ....thanks for your precious time :)
[neutral]	[05:17]	<CapaH>	This wget -c appears to be working
[negative]	[05:17]	<eck>	jshriver: pango is the gnome/gtk text rendering engine, you need it even if you have english only
[negative]	[05:17]	<atomiku>	soundray: thank you. now what about /boot/ what do you want me to do with it?
[negative]	[05:17]	<rysiek|pl>	"guys, what's with the i915 kernel driver? why do I get a load of ""i915: Unknown symbol drm_something_something"" and no direct rendering? it worked like a charm in beta!"
[negative]	[05:17]	<jshriver>	how do you tell pango to use english then?
[neutral]	[05:17]	<jshriver>	or setup my language preference in X
[neutral]	[05:17]	<eck>	jshriver: it is set by your locale/the application, not pango
[negative]	[05:17]	<Rug_>	verb3k: just warning you that all the servers are getting maxxed out, so it will be slow
[positive]	[05:17]	<yasser>	i really think etch is better:) did not gimme ANY probs....
[negative]	[05:17]	<valerie>	"i have a problem with wine when i do wine dvdshrink.exe i get an error from wine telling me ""set up was unable to create the directory "" C:Windows\is-BTU2T.temp""  error 3. path not found"
[positive]	[05:17]	<garryFre>	pipak Might try Eclipse it has many plugins for things like ruby, and perl.
[negative]	[05:17]	<jshriver>	hrm how do I set my locale for the system then lol
[neutral]	[05:18]	<atomiku>	valerie: #winehq
[positive]	[05:18]	<eck>	jshriver: usually you would set it as the language option in the gdm login screen
[negative]	[05:18]	<Gambaroni>	How do I check what network card I have in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[05:18]	<soundray>	atomiku: in the chroot, do 'mount /dev/hda1 /boot' (use the real dev name of your boot partition)
[neutral]	[05:18]	<Pici>	pipak,garryFre: Eclipse is hardly lightweight.
[negative]	[05:18]	<jrib>	yasser: oh so it just usplash.  I haven't seen that before, maybe someone else can help
[neutral]	[05:18]	<verb3k>	Rug_: That's where bittorrent comes in handy ....
[negative]	[05:18]	<verb3k>	Rug_: but that's only for the ISOs
[positive]	[05:18]	<atomiku>	soundray: Okay one second mate :)
[negative]	[05:18]	<jshriver>	eck: is there a way of doing that from the cli? or would you be willing to walk me threw it? since I can't read the strings, I have no idea which to click on
[positive]	[05:18]	<eck>	jshriver: or system > administration > language support
[negative]	[05:18]	<Rug_>	verb3k: yes ofcourse to get the .sio's but BT won't help the repos
[negative]	[05:18]	<garryFre>	pipak oops, I didn't see the light weight
[positive]	[05:19]	<Huffalump>	Gambaroni, find the Device Manager
[negative]	[05:19]	<superm1>	hey guys, for doing a server upgrade to feisty, @HLINK it says to use update-manager-core.  this package doesn't appear to be in main though?
[positive]	[05:19]	<Rug_>	variant: =) beat me to it
[positive]	[05:19]	<pipak>	garryFre: indeed it's not very lightweight, but it's still maybe worth a try :)

[neutral]	[05:20]	<Huffalump>	!fixres > kiryn
[negative]	[05:20]	<Krazytekn0>	kiryn the only way I know to do it is, sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf then add (1280X1024) to all the applicable lines, you'll know which ones when you see it

[neutral]	[05:21]	<soundray>	atomiku: is /dev/hda1 really your boot partition?
[negative]	[05:21]	<gpled>	eck: thats what i suspect it is set to.  think it should be 16
[positive]	[05:21]	<atomiku>	soundray: it has /boot/, vmlinuz and initd.img inside it, this partition is set as boot.
[neutral]	[05:21]	<Krazytekn0>	kiryn how many lines did you add it to?
[negative]	[05:21]	<letronje>	hi can i download all the files required for upgrade and then do the upgrade once all the download is over ?
[neutral]	[05:21]	<eck>	gpled: look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[negative]	[05:22]	<Black_Monkey>	kiryn: I had a similar problem after installing the nvidia driver - if you go into your settings, go to the monitor > hardware, or whatever it is in gnome, I'm guessing it shows it as a generic monitor?

[positive]	[05:35]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[neutral]	[05:35]	<boubbin>	disasm: ok, thanks
[neutral]	[05:35]	<Attis>	You need to disable the standard module.
[negative]	[05:35]	<mahdi>	or at least the linux-headers
[neutral]	[05:35]	<joshjosh>	tokyoahead, 915resolution only works for intel cards. You should just edit your xorg.conf
[negative]	[05:35]	<Dr_willis>	jube,  thats odd. Odd that its even automounting the thing.  You could just add an entry for it in the fstab then and mount it whever you want.
[negative]	[05:35]	<Ferrixman>	i used the exactly the same configuration i used last time... and yes, i disabled fglrx
[negative]	[05:35]	<Ferrixman>	could it be something wrong with gpu?
[negative]	[05:36]	<Draconicus>	Hey, I noticed that grouch.app is in Games and Amusements, but it's labeled as a GTK AIM/ICQ client... Might want to fix that.
[neutral]	[05:36]	<Pici>	z: None of those are official repositories, as such, they might not be available nor may not have files for your version.  Its not really something under Ubuntu's control.
[neutral]	[05:36]	<disasm>	boubbin: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:36]	<Krazytekn0>	z um I'd use the real repositories instead of those ones, probably will help at least
[positive]	[05:36]	<tokyoahead>	joshjosh: I have an intel card. the xorg.conf shows the correct resolution. the preferences program does not do so

[negative]	[05:36]	<z>	@HLINK thats the pastebin
[negative]	[05:36]	<hmpedersen>	Could my problems with resolution be missing drivers? If so, where would I find the nvidia drivers?

[negative]	[05:37]	<jube>	dr willis, it's a logical partition inside an extended partition... I think that is something to do with it
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Haekke>	foes the server edition have a gui as standard?
[negative]	[05:37]	<Ferrixman>	Attis, if i do: sudo glxinfo | grep direct
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Ferrixman>	direct rendering: Yes
[negative]	[05:37]	<Attis>	No distro can claim to maintain non-open source drivers, without some pretty bad legal implication.
[negative]	[05:37]	<joshjosh>	Tokoyoma, editing your xorg.conf should do the trick. remove your 915resolution and try again i guess
[negative]	[05:37]	<Attis>	Hmm Ferrix weird

[neutral]	[05:37]	<Angel-SL>	does FeistyLAMP have GD?!!!

[neutral]	[05:37]	<Angel-SL>	hello?
[negative]	[05:37]	<Dr_willis>	jube,  i dont think that should matter at all. You can always tell the fstab exactly WHERE to mount the thing.
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Haekke>	does the server edition have a gui as standard?
[neutral]	[05:37]	<Angel-SL>	ANYONE?

[negative]	[05:38]	<Dr_willis>	jube,  its defaulting to using the disks 'label' which in this case is proberly blank. so its using  the gneric 'disk'
[neutral]	[05:38]	<tokyoahead>	joshjosh: the xorg.onf showed the correct resolution since the begining, I never edited it to...
[positive]	[05:38]	<disasm>	hmpedersen: linux-restricted-modules-generic and nvidia-glx are the two ubuntu packages you need for nvidia drivers
[negative]	[05:38]	<z>	Krazytekn0: how do i enable the real repositories
[neutral]	[05:38]	<disasm>	hmpedersen: then run nvidia-xconfig
[negative]	[05:38]	<joshjosh>	Tokoyoma, hmm...
[negative]	[05:38]	<jube>	Dr willis, ok, I'll try just adding a line in fstab and remounting it to see what happens
[neutral]	[05:38]	<ZeZu>	is automatix like easyubuntu or smth ?
[negative]	[05:38]	<kiryn>	Krazytekn0 how do I restart X without restarting pc?

[neutral]	[05:38]	<Angel-SL>	IS anyone going to help me???
[negative]	[05:38]	<fiestyfoe>	what does that mean
[negative]	[05:38]	<disasm>	hmpedersen: if you're running feisty, apparently there is some new graphical thing to add drivers in the admin menu
[neutral]	[05:38]	<disasm>	fiestyfoe: sudo
[neutral]	[05:38]	<z>	kiryn: ctrl+alt+backspace
[negative]	[05:38]	<cables>	I have this problem where the master volume and headphone volumes are separate. I want to make Master control them all. Someone here helped me with that a long time ago, but I lost the instructions and I just did i clean install of Feisty. Can anyone help me?
[neutral]	[05:39]	<Jef2>	Hi  Anyone having trouble with Realtec cards after upgrade?

[negative]	[05:39]	<fiestyfoe>	disasm: I don't know what that means
[neutral]	[05:39]	<Jef2>	No  wireless
[positive]	[05:39]	<Dr_willis>	Keldoor,  use sudo command
[negative]	[05:39]	<SlimeyPete>	Keldoor: use sudo, there is no su in ubuntu (by default)

[positive]	[05:40]	<kde185>	Does anyone know how to get nm-applet to stop asking for the default keying on login(running feisty)
[negative]	[05:40]	<disasm>	Woody_: assuming you have the live cd, you can't without a reinstall, if you have the alternate cd, there should be a command apt-cd or something

[neutral]	[05:41]	<cables>	MFen, ubuntu.com and click the download link
[positive]	[05:41]	<magnetron>	Woody_ , if it is the alternate cd. you can just pop it in when edgy is running, it will update you r system

[negative]	[05:42]	<ubotu>	If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[positive]	[05:42]	<orangefly>	dr willis.... ty....same for laptop....???....
[positive]	[05:42]	<Dr_willis>	jube,  i still tend to use /dev/whatever for hd's that dont move around.
[neutral]	[05:42]	<hanzomon4>	@cables It's a setting in the /etc/asound.conf not a traditional plugin
[negative]	[05:42]	<shockent>	I did a fresh install of Feisty, and none of my OpenOffice apps have icons -- is this fixable?
[negative]	[05:42]	<vtx>	anybody use ubuntu on notebook ? all ok ?
[negative]	[05:42]	<disasm>	Woody_: yeah, dist-upgrade will upgrade you to the latest
[positive]	[05:42]	<cables>	hanzomon4, ok, i'll google it :)
[neutral]	[05:42]	<disasm>	Woody_: if you've upgraded recently, you probably don't have many packages to install

[positive]	[05:42]	<Woody_>	thanks a lot
[neutral]	[05:42]	<hmpedersen>	diasm, I did.. Before that I also had 1280x768.. Now all I have are the three aforementioned resolutions..

It appears to have backed out mostly (though /etc/apt/sources.list now points at Feisty repositories), and I've removed tomcat5.5 and apache2. I'm now told there are 1581 updates (presumably those are Feisty Fawn). Should I just tell synaptic to mark all updates and install?

[neutral]	[05:45]	<hmpedersen>	disasm one moment..
[negative]	[05:45]	<jptix__>	is 'apt-get autoremove' under any circumstance a bad idea? i see it wants to get rid of stuff like 'gnome-bin', 'gnome-libs-data', which sound important to me...
[negative]	[05:45]	<LjL>	sand_storm: the specifics of where buttons and things are might be slightly different, i doubt all the documentation has been updated yet. but in general yes, it's absolutely the same
[neutral]	[05:46]	<hmpedersen>	disasm, the native res is 1440x900
[positive]	[05:46]	<sand_storm>	Thank you
[neutral]	[05:46]	<LjL>	sand_storm: you just need to install Ubuntu on the spare partition (or if you need to keep both partitions for other uses, the installer can shrink them and make some space by itself; it's an option during installation)
[negative]	[05:46]	<nox-Hand>	Can someone help me get my Ubuntu booting
[neutral]	[05:46]	<MFen>	Dr_willis: ty

[positive]	[05:48]	<Woody_>	I believe that the ubuntu 7.04 final was released on the 15th not on the 19th. but it was official on the 19th. because there were lots of updates/upgrades after the 15th of April and some of the .iso were posted on the 15th.

[negative]	[05:49]	<mdub>	ah, was trying to update apt-get
[negative]	[05:49]	<soundray>	Huffalump2: the real solution is probably to load the nvidia-legacy module at boot instead of nvidia
[negative]	[05:49]	<disasm>	kiryn: ok, try this, sudo Xorg -configure   then edit /root/xorg.conf and change mouse to /dev/input/mice, then copy that config (after making backups of all previous configs) to /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[negative]	[06:12]	<vox754>	southafrikanse, since you a re a noob and you said you just installed it, I would say that you installed Ubuntu on top of your Windows, therefore erasing it from existence. You should have informed properly about partitions first.

[negative]	[06:19]	<soundray>	Rkyraccoon55: do you want to transfer a few files just this once, or do you want this sharing path open for the longer term?
[negative]	[06:19]	<LjL>	"sorcerer: uh, redirecting has nothing to do with any program (cat, or sort) specifically. *every* program has a so-called ""standard input"" and a ""standard output"". they're usually bound to a terminal (the Linux console, or your GNOME terminal) if you start them from there. by using "">"" and ""<"", you simply instruct the shell to redirect stdout or stdin (respectively) to someplace else (like a file)"

[negative]	[06:21]	<voraistos>	LjL: it seems it is the same bug. there are in fact multiple bug reports about this overheating issue. the problem is that in many cases, the computer doesnt power off, it just burns itself down.

[negative]	[06:21]	<SpaceBass>	mail is not in server by default...found that out
[negative]	[06:21]	<S1K3S>	maybe a bad iso?
[negative]	[06:21]	<Improved>	Nope
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Improved>	Its from official site.
[negative]	[06:22]	<LjL>	sorcerer: ?! no. cat concatenates files (and puts the result to stdout). sort sorts whatever is given in stdin, or a file
[neutral]	[06:22]	<magnetron>	Alfonzo: use locate
[positive]	[06:22]	<Dr_willis>	Improved,  that dosent mean its not bad.. it could be currpted download.

[positive]	[06:22]	<Improved>	afief, where and how ?!
[positive]	[06:22]	<soundray>	Rkyraccoon55: if you can bear using the command line, the best way is to set up sshd on one of the machines (sudo apt-get install ssh) and use 'scp -r /path/to/music user@host' to transfer files from the other machine to the sshd one
[negative]	[06:22]	<voraistos>	LjL: i think it would be VERY wise to tell people on the website before to Dl or on the IRC channel title. Many people (on the forum) actually destroyed brand new hardware, and no one does anything about it !
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Afief>	improved are you on windows now?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<sorcerer>	LjL:  ok well in a real world example how would you use sort ?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Improved>	yes
[negative]	[06:22]	<Alfonzo>	magnetron, well locate R pulls up a lot of stuff, is there any way to narrow it down?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Improved>	i am
[neutral]	[06:22]	<LjL>	sorcerer: maybe look here @HLINK
[negative]	[06:22]	<S1K3S>	Some of the mirrors have been pretty amazingly fast, I'll just try another mirror after work. Pretty excited about it actually
[neutral]	[06:23]	<magnetron>	S1K3S: do you have an ATI card? @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:23]	<PriceChild>	"voraistos, ""destroyed""?"
[neutral]	[06:23]	<erUSUL>	sorcerer: sort is for sorting... man sort
[neutral]	[06:23]	<disasm>	Malder: well... yes and know, you need to setup a mail server to route it, and then you could add root: myemail@somewhere.com to /etc/aliases and run new aliases, but the hard part is setting up a mail server
[negative]	[06:23]	<voraistos>	PriceChild: yep.
[negative]	[06:23]	<S1K3S>	magnetron: nope, its an integrated intel card in a toshiba notebook
[neutral]	[06:23]	<hanzomon4>	google.com
[neutral]	[06:23]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, define destroyed
[negative]	[06:23]	<Huffalump2>	soundray, I may have overlooked a reply some time ago.  With respect to nvidia-new, nvidia, nvidia-legacy, and nv.... are these variables in the xorg.conf directly related to the modules nvidia-glx-legacy, nvidia-glx, and nvidia-glx-new, respectively?  I wanted to understand if there was a correlation.
[negative]	[06:23]	<voraistos>	PriceChild: graphic card and processor cores burned down to hell.
[negative]	[06:23]	<LjL>	sorcerer: in a real word example, i'd use it to sort things. if i have a list of numbers (numbers.txt) and i want them to be sorted numerically from smallest to biggest, i'd type  sort -n numbers.txt > numbers2.txt 
[negative]	[06:23]	<Improved>	Afief, so where i should check that md5 checksum ? - Will it solve my burning problem ?
[neutral]	[06:23]	<Improved>	I'v downloaded that iso twice, same error.
[negative]	[06:23]	<LjL>	sorcerer: what about typing  man sort , wouldn't that clarify some issues?
[neutral]	[06:23]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, that won't be ubuntu's fault
[negative]	[06:23]	<hanzomon4>	How do you post links in here?
[neutral]	[06:24]	<soundray>	Huffalump2: no
[neutral]	[06:24]	<Rkyraccoon55>	soundray: i can bear command line but ide rather not have to use it
[positive]	[06:24]	<hanzomon4>	[url=] [/url]  ?
[negative]	[06:24]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, at the very least... the bios should turn the machine off by default when it gets too hot

[negative]	[06:24]	<magnetron>	S1K3S: OK, what is the problem, specifically?
[negative]	[06:24]	<sorcerer>	LjL: yeah mate iam reading that stuff right now
[neutral]	[06:24]	<Rkyraccoon55>	soundray: i got command lined out trying to install ati drivers on edgy
[neutral]	[06:24]	<Dr_willis>	PriceChild,  i agree with you there.
[positive]	[06:24]	<voraistos>	PriceChild: thankfully my laptop is very well cooled and the processor is capped at 600 mhz, because of the battery life, so the dammage is not important on mine, i just lost 1gig of ram.
[negative]	[06:24]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, how on earth would your ram  have been killed?
[positive]	[06:25]	<Improved>	Afief -> Why you don't answer anymore :p ?
[negative]	[06:25]	<Afief>	improved: wait i'll have to look for a windows binary somewhere

[neutral]	[06:25]	<voraistos>	PriceChild: the chipset overheated.
[negative]	[06:25]	<soundray>	Rkyraccoon55: on your first attempt, what did you do to share a folder on the network?
[neutral]	[06:25]	<LjL>	!torrents | aubade
[positive]	[06:25]	<ubotu>	aubade: Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:25]	<soundray>	Huffalump2: no, they aren't
[neutral]	[06:25]	<jessid>	after i install the sources of the kernel, where can they be found?

[negative]	[06:26]	<S1K3S>	magnetron: I'm running 6.06 server right now and was going to upgrade to 7.04. Since you can only upgrade from >6.10, I downloaded and burned the ISO and could not get my laptop to boot into the install. However, the 6.06 install disk still boots into it
[negative]	[06:26]	<S1K3S>	so I'm thinking bad iso
[neutral]	[06:26]	<Improved>	afief, could we join another channel -> That you could post me ? -> Becouse here's so many chat...
[negative]	[06:26]	<soundray>	Rkyraccoon55: did you then choose nfs or smb?

[negative]	[06:27]	<soundray>	Huffalump2: only if you have nvidia in xorg.conf will you need to load one of nvidia or nvidia-legacy as a module

[negative]	[06:27]	<Huffalump2>	soundray, okay, that I can understand.
[negative]	[06:27]	<brunoUT>	jrib: yes i just did that
[negative]	[06:27]	<brunoUT>	those don't work for me
[negative]	[06:27]	<Stig>	hi, how do I find out what soundcard ubuntu is using on my pc?
[neutral]	[06:27]	<jrib>	!doesn't work | brunoUT
[negative]	[06:27]	<ubotu>	brunoUT: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[positive]	[06:27]	<LjL>	"brunoUT: ""those""? which ""those""? there's like 30 different mirrors listed to chose among, there"
[neutral]	[06:28]	<soundray>	Rkyraccoon55: on the other side, did you try Places-Connect to server?
[neutral]	[06:28]	<spikeb>	ubotu, haha
[negative]	[06:28]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about haha - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[06:28]	<LjL>	brunoUT: i'm using the swedish ones. se.archive.ubuntu.com. they are listed.
[negative]	[06:28]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, not that I totally believe your story... have you done so much as to file a bug?
[negative]	[06:28]	<Huffalump2>	soundray, by specifying nvidia in xorg, it will automagically get the correct module (which is then probably the only one installed because I think they mutually exclude each other, if I understood what I read on the commandline)
[negative]	[06:28]	<Rkyraccoon55>	soundray: no, i did not
[neutral]	[06:28]	<S1K3S>	anyone know? Ubuntu with intel macs?

[neutral]	[06:28]	<Huffalump2>	S1K3s, sure.  and PPC, too.
[negative]	[06:28]	<Rkyraccoon55>	soundray: oh
[negative]	[06:28]	<voraistos>	PriceChild: I havent filed a bug since other people did before me, i just added my logs to the bugs, so the kernel team can see whats going on
[positive]	[06:29]	<S1K3S>	excellent
[neutral]	[06:29]	<PriceChild>	voraistos, that's something thanks
[positive]	[06:29]	<spikeb>	voraistos, good job :)

[neutral]	[06:49]	<jshriver>	csmanx: yes rather
[negative]	[06:49]	<soundray>	csmanx: yes. Was it Windows that wrecked your mbr?

[negative]	[06:50]	<DrNick1>	what's the minimum spec hardware anyone would recommend installing Ubuntu on? yes, i know about Xubuntu, but just wondering the minimum spec people think for Ubuntu for a basic internet/word-processing machine for someone.  think a 600Mhz PC w/ 192MB RAM should just about cut it?

[neutral]	[06:50]	<ubuntu>	magnetron: i shouldn't need an empty partition... i should need a partition with enough space... which I would mount as /
[neutral]	[06:50]	<jshriver>	csmanx: you have to intall windows first then linuix... windows is a pain when it comes to sharing the computer, it'll rewrite your MBR.. but there are other ways around it using a live CD, but best ot just install Windows then Linux
[neutral]	[06:50]	<erUSUL>	MadDog011: but you make it work with aiglx or with Xgl? if it's the later and you upgraded to feisty you may need to enable xgl again. i'm not sure becouse i have not upgraded yet
[neutral]	[06:50]	<kahrytan>	DrNick1: Whatever runs a compositor.
[neutral]	[06:50]	<MadDog011>	AIGLX

[neutral]	[06:50]	<nexeus>	ecgw, boot partition got formatted for feisty
[positive]	[06:51]	<magnetron>	ubuntu: well this is how it works. but you could resize the old partition to make space for the new one.
[negative]	[06:51]	<DrNick1>	kahrytan: well not really bothered about composite graphics for this machine! just a basic word processing + web browsing machine for someone
[neutral]	[06:51]	<erUSUL>	MadDog011: for aiglx you need a medern (beta) nvidia driver legacy will not do
[neutral]	[06:51]	<soundray>	!grub > jshriver, this is what ubotu says about it and what csmanx is hopefully reading now
[negative]	[06:51]	<ubuntu>	magnetron: i really don't want more partitions...
[negative]	[06:51]	<Shau1>	eck, so rather than using AD, could it be possible to modify GDW to lookup a username and password in a custom MySQL database and depending on the result log them in, I dnt want to implement Windows really because it is like spending money that you dnt needto - thats why linus created Linux lol
[positive]	[06:51]	<derek_>	PriceChild, hi ,  are u still there ?
[neutral]	[06:51]	<ubuntu>	magnetron: the previous installers (including feisty beta)

[negative]	[06:51]	<Araiwa>	any solution to the problem?

[positive]	[06:56]	<jenda>	vox754: :)
[neutral]	[06:56]	<arnold-9592>	Can anyone help?
[negative]	[06:56]	<Huffalump2>	radar1976, it turns out nobody wanted to upgrade to Feisty, so they just unplugged the Ubuntu servers
[negative]	[06:57]	<DrNick1>	kahrytan: they dont want to spend any money.  and i dont think they should have to, as i think it'll run fine
[neutral]	[06:57]	<effie_jayx>	arnold-9592,  do you have the extra repositories enabled?
[neutral]	[06:57]	<erUSUL>	jenda: you can easily rgenerate an iso from a cd 'sudo cat /dev/cdrom > image.iso' and verify that
[neutral]	[06:57]	<soundray>	Laizerox,
[negative]	[06:57]	<effie_jayx>	arnold-9592,  what are you using? Feisty?
[positive]	[06:57]	<kahrytan>	drnick1: It should but maybe bit slow for my tastes.
[neutral]	[06:57]	<arnold-9592>	effie_jayx: probably not, that's a good point; and yes, i am using feisty
[positive]	[06:58]	<xorl>	"There any ""Faster"" ubuntu mirrors?"
[negative]	[06:58]	<bluefox83>	ok, i keep getting all kinds of repositories failing when i do an update in feisty..whats the deal folks?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<erUSUL>	jenda: i eexpect official sums to be in the official dl locations and mirrors in the same dir as the iso files
[negative]	[06:58]	<soundray>	Laizerox, sorry, I don't really know what to advise. Install 6.10 again and upgrade? You might hit the same problem.
[neutral]	[06:58]	<shooters>	arnold-9592: Go to system -> Admin -> Software Sources...
[positive]	[06:58]	<DrNick1>	kahrytan: yes but not being funney, it's not you we're talking about here. i think they will be happy with it
[negative]	[06:58]	<narf__>	soundray: Laizerox left, but ... I have the same problem
[neutral]	[06:58]	<jenda>	erUSUL: is generating an .iso from the CD necessary? I only want to know if it burned correctly.
[positive]	[06:58]	<kahrytan>	bluefox: to many people upgrading
[neutral]	[06:58]	<effie_jayx>	arnold-9592,  enable them... read more at www.ubuntuguide.org

[neutral]	[06:58]	<pipeline_>	anyone know what this is? @HLINK

[positive]	[06:58]	<eck>	jenda: i think you can diff the iso against the cdrom device
[negative]	[06:58]	<arnold-9592>	effie_jayx: right, it just slipped my mind. thanks!
[positive]	[06:58]	<soundray>	narf__: have you had success with earlier versions, too?
[negative]	[06:58]	<bluefox83>	kahrytan, i already upgraded, i'm just trying to update my sources...

[neutral]	[06:58]	<makkone->	hi
[negative]	[06:59]	<erUSUL>	jenda: if you want to verify it without booting it... maybe md5suming the device file works too but i do not know for sure

[neutral]	[06:59]	<xorl>	Slowwww repo's
[positive]	[07:00]	<kahrytan>	drnick1: There is a fine line between run and usable. How long are they willing to wait for bootup and start an application.
[negative]	[07:00]	<lichen>	so i installed feisty upgraded from edgy but i already had beryl installed from the common howtos out there.. now it would seem feisty installs all that as well, but now neither beryl nor compiz seem to work properly...
[negative]	[07:00]	<lichen>	any ideas?
[neutral]	[07:00]	<effie_jayx>	innervision,  I am
[negative]	[07:00]	<innervision>	"makkone-: is there any way to put it in ""low-energy"" mode?"
[negative]	[07:00]	<narf__>	soundray: however, I didn't really complete the upgrade - my computer crashed in the middle of it and now it won't boot
[neutral]	[07:00]	<henz>	anyone?
[negative]	[07:00]	<eck>	jenda: you might want to do diff --binary just to make sure, if diff is in text mode it will read the whole file into memory
[positive]	[07:00]	<makkone->	innervision  dunno :)
[neutral]	[07:00]	<henz>	mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock

[negative]	[07:00]	<bluefox83>	lichen, i have the same issue...i think we need to wait and let beryl catch up to what feisty is doing...
[negative]	[07:00]	<xorl>	seriously are there any faster mirrors than the stock archive mirrors?
[negative]	[07:00]	<innervision>	effie_jayx: maybe you had an idea on that? (low-consumption mode for the ATI)
[neutral]	[07:00]	<bluefox83>	xorl, not for upgrading
[negative]	[07:00]	<effie_jayx>	innervision,  no sorry :S
[negative]	[07:00]	<xorl>	this is like torture.
[neutral]	[07:00]	<xorl>	bluefox83: just regular. + updates
[negative]	[07:01]	<innervision>	makkone-: there is a way to do that with fglrx, but I don't think there is with the open source driver
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xorl>	Not upgrading.
[negative]	[07:01]	<narf__>	soundray: I can mount the hdd using a live cd, but I can't boot from it. if you have a solution even for downgrading I'd be happy
[negative]	[07:01]	<kahrytan>	xorl: Trying to download iso directly?
[positive]	[07:01]	<lichen>	well i think beryl is going to be merged back into compiz, but is compiz already at the same where it has the full functionality of beryl?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xorl>	kahrytan: no.
[negative]	[07:01]	<erUSUL>	henz: something is wrong with the failesystem in /dev/sda1... can you use mount in it?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xorl>	I have it installed already (feisty)
[negative]	[07:01]	<lichen>	shooters, and yeah... it's all scripted up to start when i do an xgl session
[neutral]	[07:01]	<Shaffox>	!mount

[neutral]	[07:01]	<bluefox83>	lichen, no it's not
[negative]	[07:01]	<soundray>	narf__: in that case, I suggest you boot the Desktop CD, mount the root partition to /mnt and run 'sudo chroot /mnt/ bash'. Then you can complete the upgrade with 'dpkg --configure -a'
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xorl>	cause it downloads at like 10-20kb/sec
[neutral]	[07:01]	<Shaffox>	!fstab
[positive]	[07:01]	<entropy>	soundray, thanks man :)
[negative]	[07:01]	<ubotu>	The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See @HLINK and !Partitions
[negative]	[07:01]	<kahrytan>	xorl: I don't. I am seeding it.
[positive]	[07:01]	<xorl>	you got a 20mb package, it's going to take a century to download.

[neutral]	[07:02]	<julian>	where can i get the default sources list for feisty
[negative]	[07:02]	<kahrytan>	xorl: and I am waiting for repo servers to calm down. There is no patches for edgy.
[positive]	[07:02]	<xorl>	magnetron: thanks for that tid bit/

[positive]	[07:02]	<julian>	thank you
[negative]	[07:02]	<atomiku>	how can I burn an iso from livecd if I cant eject the cd rom rdrive?
[negative]	[07:03]	<henz>	erUSUL: it says line 6 is bad in fstab
[negative]	[07:03]	<jenda>	"eck: ""diff: /dev/cdrom: Input/output error"" - I'm guessing that means the CD is borked, if repeated?"
[negative]	[07:03]	<soundray>	atomiku: only if you have a second drive for burning
[neutral]	[07:03]	<erUSUL>	henz: it's an ext3 fs?
[negative]	[07:03]	<narf__>	soundray: um, only one more question - do I have to boot from the feisty live cd, or I can do it from the dapper one, for example ?
[neutral]	[07:03]	<atomiku>	soundray: NO WAY! :O
[neutral]	[07:03]	<atomiku>	I need to get 7.04 burned damnit
[negative]	[07:03]	<eck>	jenda: check dmesg, it will say if there was a read error on the device
[negative]	[07:03]	<atomiku>	soundray: what if i somehow eject it anwyay
[neutral]	[07:03]	<atomiku>	cause im a rebel you see

[negative]	[07:03]	<guillem101>	meld is no longer doing syntax highlighting

[negative]	[07:04]	<henz>	erUSUL: whats that?
[negative]	[07:04]	<innervision>	ah, dammit, I'll go back to fglrx
[negative]	[07:04]	<narf__>	soundray: ok
[neutral]	[07:04]	<soundray>	atomiku: it won't work then.
[positive]	[07:04]	<kahrytan>	I am looking forward then my tv tuner gets linux support.
[negative]	[07:04]	<bluefox83>	it seems to me that if you want to use another server than the main one, the reason it fails to download stuff is cus the other servers haven't finished mirroring the main one yet
[positive]	[07:04]	<atomiku>	soundray: its still working :)
[neutral]	[07:04]	<erUSUL>	henz: please post the output of 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda' in a pastebin

[negative]	[07:05]	<hylje>	kahrytan: you get better luck with buying a tv tuner that works with linux to begin with
[positive]	[07:05]	<kahrytan>	but this is a ATSC tuner.
[negative]	[07:05]	<soundray>	atomiku: well, your rebel ways may pay off, let's see if you can complete the burn
[negative]	[07:05]	<jenda>	eck: How about @HLINK
[positive]	[07:05]	<bluefox83>	lichen, i found a neat little thing for installing beryl correctly in feisty :D
[neutral]	[07:05]	<henz>	erUSUL: i get the same as before when i do that
[neutral]	[07:05]	<eck>	jenda: i think that means that the cd drive had problems reading the cd
[positive]	[07:06]	<Huffalump2>	my Audigy card was never found by Edgy, but works great in Feisty! :D
[negative]	[07:06]	<jenda>	eck: ok, thx

[positive]	[07:13]	<PriceChild>	silver6, argh that's gone... well yeah all mirrors are slow :)
[negative]	[07:13]	<erUSUL>	henz: i asume that you are in a livecd now? you can not boot your system, right?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<radar1976>	Enselic_ you can't use bittorrent for an inplace upgrade
[neutral]	[07:13]	<magnetron>	hej sofia
[negative]	[07:13]	<bluefox83>	silver6, a major ubuntu release just came out, millions of people are updating right now :X
[neutral]	[07:13]	<henz>	erUSUL: im not on a cd i got 6.10 installed
[negative]	[07:14]	<rogue780|laptop>	can someone tell me how to change the default keyring password? I accidentally put it in with capslock on...and it's annoying me
[neutral]	[07:14]	<soundray>	tristanmike: loose cable?
[negative]	[07:14]	<alex_dinamo>	has someone have any trouble with sound since Feisty update? I'm having... alsa seems all disconfigured
[negative]	[07:14]	<Enselic_>	radar1976: oh, you mean that kind of update....
[neutral]	[07:14]	<Lunar_Lamp>	radar1976, couldn't you download the alternative cd via bittorrent and upgrade fromt hat? iirc the alt. cd allows upgrade.
[neutral]	[07:14]	<yopi>	Hi I have a etch distro, is it the right chan?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<tristanmike>	"soundray: other ""burned"" dvd's work"
[negative]	[07:14]	<erUSUL>	henz: and why are you trinuing to mount /dev/sda1 it is already mounted in /
[neutral]	[07:14]	<erUSUL>	?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<mlalkaka>	Hi everyone
[neutral]	[07:14]	<eck>	rogue780|laptop: try gnome-keyring-manager
[neutral]	[07:14]	<tristanmike>	soundray: like data dvd's and such
[negative]	[07:14]	<Pici>	yopi: Nope, you'd want a debian channel.
[neutral]	[07:15]	<tristanmike>	"soundray: lemme try a ""backup"" dvd...."
[negative]	[07:15]	<radar1976>	Lunar_Lamp I could but only one system to upgrade, so why waste a CD
[negative]	[07:15]	<mwbohn>	After I upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04, my the CD drive on my System76 laptop stopped working.  There is no /dev/scd0, /dev/cdrom, or /dev/hd*  Anyone have experience with this?
[negative]	[07:15]	<radar1976>	something that I don't have alot of
[neutral]	[07:15]	<ctothej>	what are the Super_[X]  keycodes?
[neutral]	[07:15]	<magnetron>	hi mlalkaka
[positive]	[07:15]	<Lunar_Lamp>	radar1976, use a cd-rw :-p
[negative]	[07:15]	<radar1976>	don't have any of those
[negative]	[07:15]	<soundray>	radar1976: sounds like you just have to be patient then
[negative]	[07:15]	<lnxmomo>	hi everyone, i would like to know if i can disable the wireless driver that came with ubuntu and use ndiswrapper?
[positive]	[07:15]	<eck>	"ctothej: usually super is the same as the ""windows"" key"
[positive]	[07:15]	<radar1976>	it is running faster today tho
[neutral]	[07:15]	<henz>	erUSUL: i see the disk in nautilus as WD passport but when i clicik it it doesnt open
[negative]	[07:16]	<rogue780|laptop>	eck, that lets me change the keys in the keyring...but I can't figure out how to change the actual keyring password
[negative]	[07:16]	<Agony>	OK, I have a problem.
[positive]	[07:16]	<soundray>	lnxmomo: yes, you can blacklist the default driver. Ubotu will send you a private message
[neutral]	[07:16]	<radar1976>	much faster
[neutral]	[07:16]	<magnetron>	lnxmomo: generally, ndiswrapper has less functionality
[neutral]	[07:16]	<soundray>	!blacklist > lnxmomo
[negative]	[07:16]	<Agony>	I just upgraded to 7.04
[negative]	[07:16]	<kahrytan>	Someone should develop Windows driver wrapper FOR ANY driver.
[negative]	[07:16]	<Agony>	But now it refuses to boot.
[positive]	[07:16]	<ctothej>	eck: xev reports the Super_R is pressed on one of my keyboard buttons, is there a Super_L, etc too?
[neutral]	[07:16]	<Pici>	!enter | Agony
[negative]	[07:16]	<ubotu>	"Agony: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the ""Enter"" key as punctuation!"
[neutral]	[07:16]	<eck>	rogue780|laptop: i would delete the keyring entry from gconf then and just recreate it
[neutral]	[07:16]	<henz>	erUSUL: as before mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[negative]	[07:16]	<henz>	error: could not execute pmount
[negative]	[07:16]	<radar1976>	I was getting barely 20-30k yesterday... now getting 300k
[neutral]	[07:16]	<eck>	ctothej: it depends on your keyboard layout
[negative]	[07:16]	<soundray>	kahrytan: no, manufacturers should open their specs so proper drivers can be written.
[neutral]	[07:16]	<erUSUL>	henz: do 'nautilus /'
[negative]	[07:17]	<lnxmomo>	ah, thanx soundray and magnetron
[negative]	[07:17]	<tristanmike>	"soundray: ok, my ""backup"" dvd works, but factory DVD's don't read as inserted and, as according to the Support docs under ""System"", I made gxine the default DVD player and that pops up with the ""backup"" movie dvd, but nothing happens when I insert a factory DVD"
[negative]	[07:17]	<Pici>	Agony: Do you get an error? 'doesnt boot' is kinda vauge.
[negative]	[07:17]	<mlalkaka>	"I'm in the process of upgrading from edgy to feisty, and a Debconf screen titled ""Configuring mdadm"" has appeared. It's asking me to specify ""MD arrays needed for the root filesystem"". But I don't have any raid (MD arrays) devices on my computer. What do I enter in the text box? all or none?"
[positive]	[07:17]	<Rage__>	Hi, was just wondering if there is a way to install ubuntu with only xserver all setup and maybe gnome but not all the programs that I dont need so I can install only things I want... Is the best way to do that to in stall server edition and install xserver? TBH I dont even want gnome I use evilwm. :)
[positive]	[07:17]	<magnetron>	kahrytan: SOMEONE should develop Linux drivers for ALL devices =)
[negative]	[07:17]	<eck>	ctothej: in gnome you can also configure what is recognized as super with system > preferences > keyboard
[neutral]	[07:17]	<henz>	erUSUL: and?
[negative]	[07:17]	<kahrytan>	soundray: or manufacturers just do it themselves.
[negative]	[07:17]	<ctothej>	eck: oh, like left and right win/super keys. I got that now. Oh ok, ill check that out too.
[neutral]	[07:17]	<DrNick1>	Rage__: yep, boot from the alternate CD and install a commandline system, which is an option in the menu
[negative]	[07:18]	<Agony>	OK, sorry. I upgraded to 7.04, but now it refuses to boot, the progress bar doesn't move at all.
[negative]	[07:18]	<soundray>	kahrytan: no, that results in bad drivers. See fglrx and nvidia
[positive]	[07:18]	<kahrytan>	Nvidia drivers work just fine.
[neutral]	[07:18]	<erUSUL>	henz: post the output of 'cat /proc/mounts' in a pastebin
[negative]	[07:18]	<Pici>	Agony: If you press ctrl-alt-F1 ,  are you getting any error messages?
[negative]	[07:18]	<soundray>	kahrytan: yeah, if you happen to have a recent card.
[negative]	[07:18]	<kahrytan>	I got FX 5200
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Rage__>	DrNick1: What package is needed for an x-server install all working? x-windows-system was debian...?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<aa^way>	hey
[neutral]	[07:18]	<aa^way>	some deobfuscater for java in ubuntu?
[negative]	[07:18]	<DrNick1>	Rage__: then, just install whatever you want.  I used this method to make a working system on a P166Mhz with 64Mb memory!  (but not with GNOME obviously!)
[neutral]	[07:18]	<kahrytan>	not exactly recent.
[neutral]	[07:19]	<tristanmike>	"soundray, another odd thing of note is that when I shut down the computer last night I left my DVD in the drive, when I rebooted this morning, the icon on the desktop listed the media ""Blank DVD"" even though it was the factory movie"
[neutral]	[07:19]	<rambo3>	Rage__, use meta packages
[negative]	[07:19]	<Agony>	I'll go check, hang on a second. This'll be annoying, I only have the one machine.
[negative]	[07:19]	<DrNick1>	err, i can't remember now, xorg-base i believe
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Pici>	Agony: before you go
[neutral]	[07:19]	<kahrytan>	I'm waiting on CX23418 support.
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Agony>	Yes?
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Huffalump2>	kahrytan, your FX 5200 works with nvidia-glx-new and you can do Beryl, et al?
[neutral]	[07:20]	<soundray>	tristanmike: this is a really weird problem. Have you got a second DVD drive for testing?
[negative]	[07:20]	<Pici>	Agony: If you remove the quiet nosplash options from your grub menu (edit by pressing 'e'), if the ctrl-alt-f1 method doesnt reveal anything.
[neutral]	[07:20]	<henz>	erUSUL: @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:20]	<Rage__>	rambo3: which package am I looking for?
[negative]	[07:20]	<Penggu>	hi all. is it possible to run ubuntu as a livecd, whilst using some local partitions for user data stoage and swap ?
[neutral]	[07:20]	<Rage__>	rambo3: for xserver only?
[neutral]	[07:20]	<Valstorm2379>	Im using Fdutils, can someone tell the command to FORMAT the floppy in terminal???
[negative]	[07:20]	<tristanmike>	"soundray: .....perhaps I can get one...should I just ""plug and play"" ?"
[negative]	[07:20]	<eck>	Penggu: yeah, just use mount and swapon
[positive]	[07:20]	<kahrytan>	hufflalump2: It works with Beryl and Nividia drivers.
[neutral]	[07:20]	<kahrytan>	Nvidia
[negative]	[07:20]	<LjL>	Penggu: i think swap is used automatically, if a suitable partition is found. for storage - just mount
[negative]	[07:20]	<rambo3>	Rage__, ah ok install xserver-xorg
[negative]	[07:20]	<Huffalump2>	kahrytan - I cannot get anything to work on FX 5600 (aside from boring nv)
[negative]	[07:20]	<Kragnerac>	:(
[neutral]	[07:20]	<Fishy>	 Doesn't the lastest ati driver 8.36.5 work with xorg 7.2 (feisty)?
[negative]	[07:21]	<Penggu>	eck: where would the mount point be for storage ?
[negative]	[07:21]	<Kragnerac>	I should've got an nVidia card. Nothing seems to work with ATi. :(
[negative]	[07:21]	<bluefox83>	has anyoneever noticed that when you run bryl and try to watch a movie, the movie is ll glitchy?
[neutral]	[07:21]	<ogami1972>	hi all- how important is udevd?
[neutral]	[07:21]	<bluefox83>	*beryl
[negative]	[07:21]	<Penggu>	eck: i mean, is there a facility to save settings, etc?
[negative]	[07:21]	<LjL>	Penggu: what you prefer. you might want to mount to your /home directory
[negative]	[07:21]	<mwbohn>	Is beryl+xgl (fglrx) broken for 7.04 or do I have a configuration problem?  (It worked for me in 6.10)
[negative]	[07:21]	<Penggu>	eck: eg if i install vmware
[negative]	[07:21]	<henz>	erUSUL: ive read like 2 post almost identical on the internet, but with none solving, but the wierd thing is that it worked before i reinstalled
[negative]	[07:21]	<kahrytan>	huffalump2: aren't I lucky. I got a cheap msi fx 5200 from newegg.
[positive]	[07:21]	<raw-meat1>	thank you for that great release!
[positive]	[07:21]	<Rage__>	rambo3: Thanks :)
[positive]	[07:21]	<DrNick1>	bluefox83: yep i've noticed that.  i turn it off for movies :)
[negative]	[07:21]	<ogami1972>	cause it was eating all my memory, so i killed it
[positive]	[07:21]	<LjL>	Penggu: for saving settings, mount to /home. that will be only the user-specific settings, though
[neutral]	[07:21]	<eck>	Penggu: are you trying to do persistent live cd?
[negative]	[07:21]	<Adyeths>	*sigh*  How do I recover from a failed attempt at upgrading to Feisty?
[neutral]	[07:21]	<X_Force>	   /msg NickServ@service.de register nickserv31 mitterau@web.de
[negative]	[07:21]	<Penggu>	eck: i guess so
[negative]	[07:21]	<Fishy>	bluefox83: I am going to burn my card and by a nvidia soon
[negative]	[07:22]	<bluefox83>	DrNick1, so do i:(
[positive]	[07:22]	<finalbeta>	bluefox83: that's because the drivers can't handle it, and because xorg is not optimised for it yet. Beryl is still a toy.
[neutral]	[07:22]	<LjL>	X_Force: ?
[negative]	[07:22]	<X_Force>	hmm not a good idea ..
[negative]	[07:22]	<tristanmike>	soundray: ....wait a sec....something is weird....
[negative]	[07:22]	<eifzon>	anyone that had problem to install drivers for nvidia, geforce 7900GT? on 7.04 fiesty?
[negative]	[07:22]	<X_Force>	sry one space to much ..
[neutral]	[07:22]	<ikonia>	eifzon: no
[positive]	[07:22]	<Huffalump2>	kahrytan, I'd say it does sound like you are lucky.  I'm very adverse to upgrading any other machines to Feisty until this error is worked out.

[positive]	[07:22]	<DrNick1>	bluefox83: it'll get there. but for now, its only a button to click at least :)

[neutral]	[07:23]	<mwbohn>	Fishy: Did you resolve it?
[negative]	[07:23]	<eck>	Penggu: if you are trying to do persistent live cd there are some docs in the wiki, if you just want to use configuration settings on another partition you can mount it and chroot or point you app and the mount point to find the conf files
[positive]	[07:23]	<Huffalump2>	eifzon, I have a different card but have seen many people with similar problems today.
[positive]	[07:23]	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	is there a link to its version number?
[negative]	[07:23]	<eifzon>	ok Huffalump2, what to do?

[neutral]	[07:24]	<eifzon>	ill try switch to nv
[negative]	[07:24]	<erUSUL>	henz: ok, i have missunderstood you i thoughtr that /dev/sda was your main hard disk... so /dev/sda1 is a ext3 partition from another linux install? try this 'sudo fsck.ext3 -b 32768 -pcv /dev/sda1' to check the partition
[negative]	[07:24]	<Fishy>	mwbohn: No. Since beryl doesn not come with beryl_xgl I can't see how it should be solved.

[positive]	[07:24]	<mwbohn>	Fishy: Thanks for the info

[negative]	[07:41]	<ikonia>	Bo7a: is there no legacy package like for nvidia in fesity ?
[negative]	[07:41]	<soundray>	Adyeths: I would try booting the system. If it boots even to recovery mode, you can finish the upgrade with 'dpkg --configure -a'

[negative]	[07:42]	<Bo7a>	im wondering if downgrading to xorg 7.1 will help or should i just go back to edgy
[negative]	[07:42]	<LjL>	"lasse: no, although some monitors can send that information automatically. but then, if they do, your very dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will use that information when instructed to ""auto-detect"" the monitor"

[negative]	[07:43]	<Bo7a>	hehe LjL, thanks but i had i mind just installing edgy from scratch. id prefer not to do this. anyone know o f a reason not to go back to xorg 7.1 in feisty to give me the abvility to use the drivers that were around before ati forsook me
[positive]	[07:43]	<mrec>	soundray: I work at AMD, naturally linux is growing and it's seen at ATI/AMD

[negative]	[07:58]	<ctothej>	riesseg_: whats that about?
[neutral]	[07:58]	<ircusr>	i dont like kde
[neutral]	[07:58]	<Bo7a>	ok so that make two opinions ikonia, yours, and mine. and as i said. that is hartdly enought. just ignore my posts if you have nothing to add
[negative]	[07:58]	<riesseg_>	i want it, i want it, i want it !
[negative]	[07:58]	<LjL>	shwag: check @HLINK - but not now, in a couple of weeks.
[negative]	[07:58]	<antioch>	How can I configure Synaptic to use Aptitude instead of apt-get in Feisty?
[neutral]	[07:58]	<ircusr>	xubuntu ftw!
[negative]	[07:58]	<ctothej>	riesseg_: hehe.. you cant install it yet?
[positive]	[07:58]	<shingoki>	ircusr: Well you're in luck then, since everyone is going for gnome! ;)
[neutral]	[07:58]	<riesseg_>	nop
[negative]	[07:58]	<ikonia>	Bo7a: but your asking questions that are nothing to do with ubuntu - the ati drivers don't support it, question ati about it
[neutral]	[07:58]	<LjL>	antioch: you can't, since Synaptic doesn't use apt-get at all AFAIK, it is its own APT frontend.
[negative]	[07:58]	<ircusr>	yeah!
[neutral]	[07:58]	<ircusr>	gnome and xfce rule!!
[neutral]	[07:58]	<Bo7a>	my questions are about ubuntu not the drivers
[negative]	[07:58]	<riesseg_>	server is down :'(
[positive]	[07:58]	<ra21vi>	LjL: thanks
[negative]	[07:58]	<fluid>	what is the easiest way to change icons on things like, the nautilus recycle bin??
[negative]	[07:58]	<atomiku>	Im having a little trouble, I want my 4gig partition to be the partition the computer boots from, and another partition with ubuntu on it. how can I do this?
[neutral]	[07:58]	<ikonia>	Bo7a: so what is the question ?
[negative]	[07:58]	<dv_>	I want the gnome interface (maybe with a few more options) and KDE tech
[negative]	[07:58]	<soundray>	J-_: X was designed with this kind of network use in mind
[negative]	[07:59]	<shingoki>	ircusr: I would like something that look like gnome, but is as technically good as kde
[positive]	[07:59]	<Bo7a>	ie: perhaps there is a way with a lot of work to go back to xorg 7.1 :) or something far out that i havent thought of.
[negative]	[07:59]	<ctothej>	riesseg_: oh man. good luck with that.
[neutral]	[07:59]	<antioch>	"LjL, so does it keep track of dependencies and such ""smartly"" like Aptitude does?"
[negative]	[07:59]	<shingoki>	dv_: yeah exactly!
[positive]	[07:59]	<rambo3>	"Bo7a, just use ""ati"" driver its works"
[positive]	[07:59]	<riesseg_>	han! i must test thu unofficial server... perhaps...
[negative]	[07:59]	<ircusr>	shingoki: have you tried xfce?
[negative]	[07:59]	<dv_>	for graphics, throw in E17 tech
[positive]	[07:59]	<LjL>	"antioch: yes and no. Ubuntu's APT *includes* that ""smarty"" feature (not apt-get, the APT backend itself does). it works a little differently from aptitude's one, but the concept is the very same"
[neutral]	[07:59]	<bgray54>	hello
[negative]	[07:59]	<shingoki>	a gnome/kde merger would be great, the kde guys could teach the gnome guys how to code, and the gnome guys could make the kde app layouts a bit less weird
[neutral]	[07:59]	<ircusr>	hi
[neutral]	[07:59]	<ircusr>	xfce
[neutral]	[07:59]	<ircusr>	or fluxbox
[positive]	[07:59]	<Bo7a>	your definition of works is not the same as mine :p i am posting from feisty with ati as driver. but this is not optimal. so rather than just give up and go back to edgy i figured id watch the chatter in here for a couple of hours and maybe someone has another idea
[negative]	[08:00]	<dv_>	yeah
[neutral]	[08:00]	<eck>	shingoki: not likely
[positive]	[08:00]	<fluid>	nah they dont need to merge. hehe...
[negative]	[08:00]	<Sputnik>	ata2.01: failed to set xfermode (err_mask=0x4) How do I fix this error?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<antioch>	LjL, am I safe using aptitude and synaptic together?
[negative]	[08:00]	<LjL>	antioch: i don't know if Synaptic explicitly supports removing of unused dependencies, but you can always  sudo apt-get autoremove  to wipe the cruft at any time, even if it was installed using Synaptic
[negative]	[08:00]	<riesseg_>	someone know a french room for ubuntu?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<shingoki>	ircusr: it's not really window managers I'm bothered about, more the apps. KDE has good apps, and gnome has a good overall look and feel, but generally substandard apps
[negative]	[08:00]	<ikonia>	"Bo7a: you said yourself the card is not supported by ati - ubuntu can't change this, so your option is to use the ""broke"" ati driver or bo back to a working senario in edgy"
[neutral]	[08:00]	<StoneNote>	!fr
[neutral]	[08:00]	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[negative]	[08:00]	<hans0lo>	I just ran a bunch of updates, and it's complaining about software no longer supported, which is now community supported. What repos do I need to add?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<riesseg_>	!fr
[negative]	[08:00]	<ircusr>	ah
[neutral]	[08:00]	<J-_>	soundray: cool, never knew that. I thought that I needed to have both systems GUI to actually SSH into one and have a GUI working on the server as well.
[neutral]	[08:00]	<ircusr>	brb
[negative]	[08:00]	<Agony>	@HLINK <- That's the errors I get when I attempt to boot 7.04
[neutral]	[08:00]	<ircusr>	lunch
[negative]	[08:00]	<LjL>	antioch: the unused dependencies databases *should* be synced between APT and aptitude, but i wouldn't bet on it.
[neutral]	[08:00]	<ikonia>	Bo7a: its not an ubuntu isse, its the driver issue if its not up to your requirments
[positive]	[08:00]	<PriceChild>	antioch, aptitude maintains its own list. so if you use both aptitude and synaptic then aptitude won't undo dependencies as well
[positive]	[08:00]	<surviver>	anyone familiar with wine?
[neutral]	[08:01]	<matkix0s_>	!beryl
[neutral]	[08:01]	<LjL>	!anyone | surviver
[neutral]	[08:01]	<dv_>	shingoki, a good example is the comparison kioslaves vs. gnomevfs
[positive]	[08:01]	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[negative]	[08:01]	<ubotu>	"surviver: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with ""Does anyone/anybody...""  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?"
[neutral]	[08:01]	<antioch>	LjL, do apt-get and synaptic share the list?
[negative]	[08:01]	<Bo7a>	ok, ikonia, plz stop replying. yes i understand that for you and i the only visible solution is to go back to edgy. but who is to say that someonei n here wont have a nother idea before i finally give in and go back
[positive]	[08:01]	<shingoki>	dv_: or the kde components (kparts I think?) that make konqueror so very very nice to use :)
[neutral]	[08:01]	<ep2011>	is 10gb on / and 40 on /home a smart combo?
[neutral]	[08:01]	<eck>	dv_: how are kioslaves better?
[neutral]	[08:01]	<antioch>	PriceChild, , do apt-get and synaptic share the list?
[positive]	[08:01]	<LjL>	antioch: yes, the list is mantained centrally by the APT backend itself.
[negative]	[08:01]	<ikonia>	Bo7a: what do you expect though, you don't have a working driver ???? what do you expect people to do  ???
[neutral]	[08:01]	<shingoki>	dv_: also just stuff like kpdf being so very much better than the various gnome pdf viewers
[positive]	[08:01]	<LjL>	antioch: the aptitude list is separate however
[positive]	[08:02]	<PriceChild>	ikonia, best you leave it alone please :)
[positive]	[08:02]	<surviver>	this is my real question nabs :p
[negative]	[08:02]	<Bo7a>	suggest a method of making xorg 7.1 work with feisty? or something else that you or i havent htought of
[positive]	[08:02]	<antioch>	LjL, I see. Thank you.
[negative]	[08:02]	<dv_>	eck, their modularity is much better designed
[neutral]	[08:02]	<alex_dinamo>	hello
[negative]	[08:02]	<janpo>	"Sputnik: have you tried with ""ide=nodma"" at boot ?"
[negative]	[08:02]	<eck>	dv_: isn't it true that you cannot access a kioslave like a mountpoint, like fuse?
[negative]	[08:02]	<Bo7a>	there is no harm in asking every 10-15 minutes. maybe someone has thougth of something we havent
[negative]	[08:02]	<atomiku>	Im having a little trouble, I want my 4gig partition to be the partition the computer boots from, and another partition with ubuntu on it. how can I do this?
[neutral]	[08:02]	<surviver>	i need some information about wine
[neutral]	[08:02]	<Agony>	Can anyone shed any light on this? @HLINK
[neutral]	[08:02]	<LjL>	"antioch: anyway, very likely Feisty's Synaptic includes an ""autoremove"" feature, so no need to call apt-get just for that -- check, i don't have Synaptic installed"
[neutral]	[08:02]	<soundray>	J-_: well, you need some client X libraries on the server, but not the actual X server and graphics drivers.
[negative]	[08:02]	<dv_>	eck, thats the interface part
[neutral]	[08:02]	<boubbin>	!proftpd
[negative]	[08:02]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about proftpd - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[08:03]	<PingunZ>	What package do I need for xconfig ( I want to recompile my kernel )
[neutral]	[08:03]	<ikonia>	PriceChild: understood.
[neutral]	[08:03]	<atomiku>	You see
[neutral]	[08:03]	<LjL>	!info proftpd > boubbin
[negative]	[08:03]	<atomiku>	I think im doing this wrong
[neutral]	[08:03]	<PingunZ>	!xconfig > PingunZ
[negative]	[08:03]	<ra21vi>	LjL: actually i want to know if upgrade is possible thru downloaed Alternate images, i cannt burn it cuz my cdwriter not functioning, old hardware peoblem bro
[neutral]	[08:03]	<dv_>	in fact, there are kio fuse gateways already
[negative]	[08:03]	<erUSUL>	PingunZ: qt3-dev or something like that
[neutral]	[08:03]	<PingunZ>	erUSUL: ty
[negative]	[08:03]	<Sputnik>	janpo, what does it do?
[positive]	[08:03]	<eck>	dv_: the issue is that both kde and gnome should just be using fuse, not implementing some compatibility layer
[positive]	[08:03]	<dv_>	and its very likely that the kioslaves of kde4 will based on fused
[neutral]	[08:03]	<dv_>	-d
[negative]	[08:04]	<shingoki>	anyway thanks for the advice on desktop effects, I'll give it a go. Also beryl, although TBH every GL accelerated window manager thingy I've ever tried has just spectacularly trashed itself within a few seconds
[neutral]	[08:04]	<dv_>	eck, fuse didnt exist when they started
[positive]	[08:04]	<LjL>	ra21vi: uhm... it's possibly possible =) loop-mount the Alternate ISO... but then why not just upgrade over the internet, since that's what you'd be doing, basically, anyway?
[negative]	[08:04]	<ra21vi>	LjL: will it work if i mount the image, and then tell synaptics to add cdriom
[negative]	[08:04]	<alex_dinamo>	has anyone had any trouble with sound/alsa since upgrading to Feisty?
[neutral]	[08:04]	<styvy>	Agony, did you check your cd with md5?
[positive]	[08:04]	<slicknick>	anyone seen this sort of behavior from rdesktop before? this is a dual monitor screenshot with an rdesktop session to a windows machine on the right side of the image. @HLINK
[negative]	[08:04]	<ra21vi>	LjL: yeah right..
[neutral]	[08:04]	<ikonia>	alex_dinamo: a few people with intel chipsets have reported problems
[negative]	[08:04]	<alex_dinamo>	it doesn't work at all... n drivers are loaded, alsaconf doesn't detect any card...
[negative]	[08:04]	<LjL>	ra21vi: it might, you'd have to try and perhaps fiddle a bit with loopback mounting and sources.list -- but why in the world would you do that?
[positive]	[08:04]	<uber-n00b>	hi all :D
[negative]	[08:04]	<janpo>	Sputnik: switches off kernels dma on ide channels. Your error could be unsupported drive controller. Just a qualified guess
[negative]	[08:05]	<alex_dinamo>	ikonia, I think I have that one... NVidia integrated AC97 audio
[negative]	[08:05]	<Taim>	"Anybody know how to disable ""tooltips"" in gnome?"
[positive]	[08:05]	<cliebow_>	im told cd burned faster than 8x may have corruption of very highlt cmressed files..
[negative]	[08:05]	<Blubloblu>	Hi there, I need help with an Edgy to Feisty upgrade that went wrong
[negative]	[08:05]	<deserteagle>	hello all, anyone have a clue as to why after installing feisty my monitor looks like it has 8 bit colors?
[neutral]	[08:05]	<ikonia>	alex_dinamo: no thats nvidia not intel
[negative]	[08:05]	<LjL>	ra21vi: i mean, instead of telling APT to just download the packages, you're downloading the ISO, then mounting, then telling APT to download the packages from inside it. doesn't make a bit of sense to me TBH
[positive]	[08:05]	<dv_>	eck, but yes, the way I see it fuse will be the common future
[neutral]	[08:05]	<compengi>	LjL: hi
[negative]	[08:05]	<dv_>	I already favor fusemb over the kernel smbfs
[neutral]	[08:05]	<LjL>	compengi, hi
[negative]	[08:05]	<alex_dinamo>	ikonia, mmh... ok
[neutral]	[08:05]	<deserteagle>	nvidia graphics card
[neutral]	[08:05]	<ikonia>	dere
[neutral]	[08:05]	<ikonia>	se
[negative]	[08:05]	<Pici>	cliebow_: Yes, if you have issues we suggest that you burn the cd/dvd at the slowest speed.
[neutral]	[08:05]	<ikonia>	oops
[neutral]	[08:05]	<alex_dinamo>	ikonia, I think the driver said something about intel though
[negative]	[08:05]	<shingoki>	cliebow_: I wouldn't have thought that the compression of the files would affect likelihood of errors, it's probably just that they have checksums so you noticed
[negative]	[08:05]	<compengi>	LjL: have you made a good source.list?
[neutral]	[08:05]	<ikonia>	deserteagle: you'll need the nvidia propritary drivers from the repo
[neutral]	[08:05]	<PingunZ>	got it erUSUL, ty
[negative]	[08:05]	<ra21vi>	LjL: actually I downladed the images for local distribution, but found the Writer not working , lol,... bad luck
[positive]	[08:06]	<POVaddct>	dv_: sshfs is also very nice
[negative]	[08:06]	<Agony>	styvy: What do you mean check my cd with md5?
[neutral]	[08:06]	<deserteagle>	ikonia: i let ubuntu install them when i told it to enable desktop effects
[negative]	[08:06]	<deserteagle>	=\
[negative]	[08:06]	<LjL>	compengi: uh?
[positive]	[08:06]	<shingoki>	cliebow_: I've definitely had burn errors when writing at high speed, and if you are ever going to notice errors it will be on install discs :)
[neutral]	[08:06]	<ikonia>	deserteagle: reconfigure Xorg then to make sure its all set right
[neutral]	[08:06]	<dv_>	I hope feisty + 1 will make more use of fuse
[neutral]	[08:06]	<ikonia>	deserteagle: also check if its using the drivers

[neutral]	[08:08]	<styvy>	Agony, the error message you posted might mean your cd has not the right code, you can check it with comparing the md5-sums

[negative]	[08:08]	<Blubloblu>	I upgraded Edgy to Feisty using update manager and now when I boot, it says something about bad blocks on a partition. I can't load X, forced to use a command line but home directory was on bad partition

[negative]	[08:09]	<Andeh>	shingoki: thats about as fast as it usually goes but the internet optimiser for windows made it go to 400 kb/s
[negative]	[08:09]	<shingoki>	Andeh: not for linux, stuff like that tends to be windows, but there's no technical reason it couldn't be done quite easily. Actually you could make one yourself if you buy a shell server login with a good bandwidth allowance

[neutral]	[08:12]	<ikonia>	Caramba_: google for it, the user option is rerequired

[negative]	[08:14]	<Andeh>	ikonia: Oh, i think it is. When i was running <Other operating system> it was much faster. Are there any common things that might be slowing it down?

[negative]	[08:29]	<frying_fish>	biqut2: don't you actually need to do ssh -X not ssh -Y

[negative]	[08:29]	<matkix0s_>	When I run nvidia-settings and change them it allows me to save to my x config.... but then i restart x server and no luck.... so I'm thinking its not saving it in the correct location.

[negative]	[08:31]	<linxeh>	ForzaPalermo: maybe use the gnome disk usage util or something
[neutral]	[08:31]	<eck>	VR_: you add it on the grub kernel line
[negative]	[08:31]	<VR_>	eck, where's that located?
[negative]	[08:31]	<wheels3572>	What happens if you have Gaim open and your doing an upgrade?
[neutral]	[08:31]	<Huffalump2>	robert__ try #openoffice.org
[negative]	[08:31]	<linxeh>	ForzaPalermo: or you can do a du -sk / | sort -n
[negative]	[08:31]	<Marupa>	wheels3572, nothing.
[negative]	[08:31]	<eck>	VR_: in your menu.lst, or if you hit e when you're in the grub screen
[positive]	[08:31]	<VR_>	eck, and also, is that permanently there when i add it?
[negative]	[08:32]	<Melvinator>	Hey is APT-PROXY supposed to be installed in Dapper?
[negative]	[08:32]	<eck>	VR_: to make it permanent you have to do menu.lst
[negative]	[08:32]	<wheels3572>	Marupa, will it upgrade Gaim for you if that's the issue?
[negative]	[08:32]	<Jonkka>	someway to play a soundile instead of the pc-speaker beep in the gnome-terminal? my laptop doesnt have any pc-speaker >_<
[negative]	[08:32]	<aurelieng>	hi, I have a problem with my freshly upgraded dapper to edgy. gnome start, then is killed, and back to gdm. Any idea please ?
[negative]	[08:32]	<ForzaPalermo>	linxeh, what does that do?
[negative]	[08:32]	<VR_>	eck, thanks.  just one more thing... if i want to test it, how do i get to grub?
[neutral]	[08:32]	<eck>	atomiku: it will be something like linux-image-$(uname -r)
[neutral]	[08:32]	<Marupa>	wheels3572, gaim is loaded into memory, the executeable can be altered and the loaded instance of gaim won't be affected until you restart it.
[negative]	[08:32]	<linxeh>	ForzaPalermo: disk usage, summary (in kilobytes) per directory in the directory you give it (ie /)
[positive]	[08:33]	<atomiku>	eck: okay one minute :D
[neutral]	[08:33]	<linxeh>	ForzaPalermo: you can then find the biggest, and then work through each until you find out what is eating your space
[negative]	[08:33]	<ubu>	eck,  dmesg | grep drm gives me this [   84.008000]  [drm:drm_unlock]  *ERROR* Process 5559 using kernel context 0
[neutral]	[08:33]	<ForzaPalermo>	linxeh, its taking a while
[neutral]	[08:33]	<eck>	VR_: when you boot up and you're at the grub screen where you choose what kernel/OS to boot, you can hit e and then edit the parameters grub will boot with
[negative]	[08:33]	<atomiku>	eck: so I apt-get install it, right?
[neutral]	[08:33]	<JanK_>	how to see which process locks a file?
[negative]	[08:33]	<Marupa>	anyone have any problems with feisty and nvidia?
[positive]	[08:33]	<linxeh>	ForzaPalermo: it takes a while to run though as it trawls the directory structure to do it
[negative]	[08:33]	<matkix0s_>	"When I edit the x config I should save to ""/etc/X11/xorg.conf"" correct?"
[negative]	[08:33]	<VR_>	eck, alright, thanks.
[negative]	[08:33]	<wheels3572>	Marupa, ok cuz it says close all programs before upgrading to Feisty

[negative]	[08:33]	<Dyegov>	Hi, I have just installed Feisty and I do not know how to use the 3D cube effect
[negative]	[08:33]	<eck>	atomiku: you probably have to reinstall it -- if the files are missing, installing the package will put them there
[negative]	[08:33]	<matkix0s_>	Well my settings are not keeping... is there anywhere else I may need to save to?
[neutral]	[08:34]	<atomiku>	k
[neutral]	[08:34]	<DigitalNinja>	How are the servers doing on the second day of Feisty Fawn?
[negative]	[08:34]	<Marupa>	wheels3572, you're supposed to, but it shouldn't hurt you _too_ bad.  worst thing that can happen is you have to clear gaim's preferences.
[neutral]	[08:34]	<atomiku>	E: Invalid operation reinstall
[negative]	[08:34]	<ra21vi>	Dyegov: go into system->Prefereces, and there enable Desktop Effects

[negative]	[08:39]	<Enselic_>	eck: ah ok
[neutral]	[08:40]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: Get Beryl
[negative]	[08:40]	<DesertEagle>	could anyone clue me in as to why the restricted nvidia-glx drivers make the monitor look like its only running 8 colors?
[negative]	[08:40]	<eck>	leroi: you might try @HLINK
[negative]	[08:40]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: But I have an Nvidia 64MB video card. Don't know if it will work
[neutral]	[08:40]	<eck>	leroi: the interface looks almost the same as utorrent
[neutral]	[08:40]	<DesertEagle>	it's really bugging me =(
[negative]	[08:40]	<leroi>	i have tried deluge but it just seems so buggy
[negative]	[08:40]	<bebleu>	Do you know if there is a howto to install cvscedega 6 ?
[negative]	[08:40]	<leroi>	everytime you do something something else goes wrong
[neutral]	[08:41]	<eck>	leroi: i generally just use rtorrent
[negative]	[08:41]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: I don't think so
[neutral]	[08:41]	<maccam94>	bebleu, cvscedega isn't really similar to cedega binaries
[neutral]	[08:41]	<mwe>	DesertEagle: maybe you need to tweak xorg.conf
[neutral]	[08:41]	<eck>	it is curses only though
[neutral]	[08:41]	<bebleu>	ho
[neutral]	[08:41]	<DesertEagle>	mwe: how so?
[negative]	[08:41]	<s|ver|ight>	bebleu, out of curiousity, what game in particular were you looking to run with cedega?

[neutral]	[08:41]	<ubotu>	DesertEagle: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[negative]	[08:41]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: Is your video AGP or PCI Express
[negative]	[08:41]	<bebleu>	It's because cedega is freezing when I click accept :(
[negative]	[08:41]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: But would not the effects that come with Feisty work? all the others do, but not the cube
[neutral]	[08:41]	<biqut2>	"ubu, I restarted the local machine and the remote machine and still it wont work, ""root@slax:~# kate: cannot connect to X server 192.168.15.100:0"""

[positive]	[08:43]	<Enselic_>	openSUSE has conquered GRUB, when I enter a GRUB shell and tell GRUB to use root (hd0,1) (where my Ubuntu root partion is), the openSUSE boot menu is still there. Is there something I havn't grasped?

[negative]	[08:43]	<DesertEagle>	mwe: when it sasys to click the add button, what do they mean?
[negative]	[08:43]	<eck>	hmpedersen: it should be automounted by gnome, if not you can use the mount command
[negative]	[08:43]	<DigitalNinja>	"Dyegov: Did you turn it on using the ""Desktop Effects"" dialog box"
[positive]	[08:43]	<biqut2>	ubu, thanx for trying :D
[negative]	[08:43]	<jussi01>	Hi all, i have a problem, I tried to install kubuntu desktop, but it stopped at  libavahi-compat-libdnssd1. then it gave me an error and it said something about bonjour, so i tried removing that. but it wouldnt let me. the errors are here: @HLINK
[negative]	[08:43]	<DesertEagle>	"mwe: there's no ""Software Preferences"" dialog"
[negative]	[08:43]	<hmpedersen>	eck, I can't.. It's complaining about wrong filesystems..
[negative]	[08:43]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: Yes, I did, all the other effects work perfectly
[neutral]	[08:43]	<Enselic_>	jussi01: try #kubuntu
[neutral]	[08:44]	<szyjez>	i upgradet from edge to fiesty and i got some problems
[positive]	[08:44]	<eck>	Enselic_: yes, grub runs in stages :-) it is hard-coded in the mbr where to look for the stage 1.5 files, including menu.lst
[negative]	[08:44]	<radioaktivstorm>	hello! im having issues with the 7.04 wireless, it detected my card fine but it doesnt see the wireless network. i tried typing in the eesid but no dice. cna anybody give me som e pointers? (wired works fine thouhg)
[negative]	[08:44]	<DigitalNinja>	"Dyegov: You should have a ""pager"" in the lower right hand corner of the screen."
[negative]	[08:44]	<Eskim0>	"what does it mean when you get ""unknown mime-type for ""/etc/fstab"" -- using ""application/*"""""
[negative]	[08:44]	<Enselic_>	eck: yeah, but doesn't the root (hd0,1) tell it where to look for menu.lst?
[neutral]	[08:44]	<shane634>	szyjez, specific question?
[negative]	[08:44]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: It's just like the virtual desktop pager in a normal window manager
[negative]	[08:44]	<eck>	Enselic_: no -- how would it know to read hd0,1 if it can't read the menu.lst?
[negative]	[08:44]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: I have my 2 workspaces and the bin
[neutral]	[08:45]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: Click on it and it should rotate
[negative]	[08:45]	<Enselic_>	eck: from what I understand, GRUB is hd aware?
[negative]	[08:45]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: No, it jost goes from one to another normally

[negative]	[08:45]	<DigitalNinja>	"Dyegov: Did you enable the ""Cube"" effect in the dialog box"
[negative]	[08:45]	<Enselic_>	eck: doesn't one have to tell it where to find menu.lst?

[neutral]	[08:45]	<fluid>	lol
[negative]	[08:45]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: Yes, I did
[negative]	[08:45]	<fluid>	brain broke for a second there...
[negative]	[08:45]	<eck>	Enselic_: yes, you do that when you install grub onto the mbr
[negative]	[08:45]	<DesertEagle>	am i the only one having nvidia driver issues!? O_o
[negative]	[08:46]	<DesertEagle>	the screen looks ugly!
[negative]	[08:46]	<DesertEagle>	:(
[negative]	[08:46]	<DigitalNinja>	Dyegov: Log out and log back in and see if that does anything
[negative]	[08:46]	<Miasma->	why is`nt there a option to send a window to another workspace ?
[neutral]	[08:46]	<shane634>	DesertEagle, like what?
[positive]	[08:46]	<s|ver|ight>	Enselic_ I had a similar problem with the Windows XP bootloader, and it turned out to be an issue with my BIOS setup -- if you have multiple hard drives, the one that GRUB is on must be booted first.
[negative]	[08:46]	<Dyegov>	DigitalNinja: Ok, I will try, be right back
[negative]	[08:46]	<DesertEagle>	shane634: screen looks like its only running 8 colors or something
[neutral]	[08:46]	<DesertEagle>	some color distortion
[positive]	[08:46]	<Enselic_>	eck: ok, so to conquer GRUB from SUSE, I need to overwrite the MBR with my own MBR, I can't set the root partion where GRUB should look for menu.lst afterwards?
[neutral]	[08:46]	<matkix0s>	!beryl
[positive]	[08:46]	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[negative]	[08:46]	<shane634>	DesertEagle, how did you install drivers?
[negative]	[08:47]	<hmpedersen>	eck, It seems I'm wrong.. It's only come dvds.. It mounts my utility discs perfectly.. But not Guild wars nightfall!
[negative]	[08:47]	<DesertEagle>	shane634: enabling restricted hardware drivers thing
[neutral]	[08:47]	<shane634>	DesertEagle, which nvidia card?
[neutral]	[08:47]	<Tremitos>	yo
[neutral]	[08:47]	<DesertEagle>	right now i'm installing the nvidia-glx-dev package along with all its other children
[negative]	[08:47]	<eck>	Enselic_: when you install grub you specify the partition that the menu.lst is on, so you need to reinstall grub to point to the ubuntu partition (you can do this in ubuntu or suse, it doesn't matter)

[neutral]	[08:48]	<EmxBA>	I have upgraded feisty on wednesday, last time.
[negative]	[08:48]	<eck>	Enselic_: actually, you might need to be in ubuntu to do it
[negative]	[08:48]	<EmxBA>	since that there were no upgrades?
[negative]	[08:48]	<eck>	Enselic_: if you are in ubuntu (or can chroot into it) you can use grub-install
[neutral]	[08:48]	<Enselic_>	eck: so the root command (from the GRUB shell) is only local to a particular shell session? I thought that command wrote which partion to look in to the MBR...
[negative]	[08:48]	<shane634>	DesertEagle, which driver are you using?
[negative]	[08:48]	<dhgwill>	EmxBA: I didn't even do that! I clicked on the upgrade button once out of curiosity and now it won't come back :(
[negative]	[08:49]	<matkix0s>	If i edit the xconfig will it mess up beryl?
[negative]	[08:49]	<Enselic_>	eck: nah, how could this be Ubuntu specific?
[neutral]	[08:49]	<shane634>	matkix0s, yes it can
[neutral]	[08:49]	<DesertEagle>	matkix0s: it shouldn't
[neutral]	[08:49]	<matkix0s>	Humm
[negative]	[08:49]	<DesertEagle>	oh... nvm then
[positive]	[08:49]	<DesertEagle>	:P

[neutral]	[08:49]	<EmxBA>	1356 nicks? channel's not dropping since feisty released.
[negative]	[08:49]	<matkix0s>	okay... well i messed it up then! How can I tell beryl to re-edit it?
[negative]	[08:49]	<idefixx>	is there something special this upgrade  tool does? i ran it and checked manually with apt afaics there is no difference. so does it do anything out of the ordinary, non dpkg related?

[negative]	[08:50]	<hossy>	hi, i'm having some troubles with screen resolution.  i installed ubuntu on an older desktop with an nvidia geforce fx 5200 connected to an lcd tv/monitor that can run 480p or 800x600 via vga.  unbutu is only allowing me to run 640x480, and there's overscan.  how do i fix this?

[negative]	[08:57]	<moxie>	Anyone know how to make the update manager follow symbolic links when evaluating free disk space?  It won't upgrade to fiesty because it says it needs more free disk space on /var/cache/apt/archives, but /var/cache/apt is a symlink to a partition with 4GB of free space.

However, I have tried and cannot get Beryl/Compiz to work, even though I have a good computer (2 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon X1600 vid card).  When I go to System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects and enable desktop effects or whenever I launch Beryl, the screen just goes white (the only thing I can see is my mouse).  Can anyone help?

[negative]	[09:01]	<moxie>	...or is it possible to force the upgrade manager to start an upgrade, even if it thinks there's not enough disk space?
[neutral]	[09:01]	<hossy>	shane634: thanks, i'm downloading right now
[negative]	[09:01]	<abo>	ok .. giving it some days ...

[neutral]	[09:01]	<Lebowski_>	I just installed 7.04 on PPC Mac and when I restart I dont get a boot screen... directly boots to OSX
[neutral]	[09:01]	<jay2ania>	there is a grub livecd/restore cd that lets you boot different partitions, im trying to remember where it was
[negative]	[09:02]	<erstazi>	shane634: that's what I figured, but I have to be paranoid with the amount of money on this box.
[negative]	[09:02]	<szyjez>	Can I do a reupgrade ? or a fix of distro ?
[neutral]	[09:02]	<shane634>	hossy, when you get it run sudo envy -g for graphical interface

[negative]	[09:03]	<fiXXXerMe1>	How do I display the trash folder on the desktop in 7.04?
[neutral]	[09:03]	<jay2ania>	if you can boot into the livecd, you should be able to look at the partition table with either cfdisk (like DOS fdisk) or the gnome partition tool.
[negative]	[09:03]	<mpfeif101>	slyfox: Neither, I use gmail (webmail).  If I am correct, use Evolution if you just want a simple mail client, Thunderbird if you are a more advanced user (and could use the themes/extensions/etc).  Both fundamentally do the same thing tho
[negative]	[09:03]	<DigitalNinja>	fiXXXerMel: That's not easy to do

[negative]	[09:05]	<Caramba_>	Hmph...oh, well, everybody, using pmount instead of mount everything went A-OK, no need to be root, as long as the fstab-entry is fine. Too simple...Thanks to all who participated in the discussion!

[negative]	[09:48]	<aburton>	@cliebow_ the harddrive is new, and I keep running diagnostics on it and there aren't any errors. Could it be a SATA controller?

[neutral]	[10:05]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: /hda/??? what goes there
[negative]	[10:05]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner okay.  make a directory /mnt/

[negative]	[10:06]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, my stumbling block in following the tutorial was I didn't (at first) realize the need to create the /mnt/ directory.  Do that and we'll move on to making it work gloriously for you
[neutral]	[10:06]	<Jordan_U>	tehquickness, You can try without the -i ( interactive, will ask yo if you are sure )
[negative]	[10:06]	<Lin>	eck: they say: seems like an ubuntu problem..
[neutral]	[10:07]	<Fathefner>	what is a /mnt/

[neutral]	[10:07]	<PriceChild>	Huffalump2, don't mount on /mnt/ do it somewhere like /mnt/foo or /media/foo
[negative]	[10:07]	<styvy>	HELPMEEE, do you have two networkcards? the first one is eth0, the second one eth1
[negative]	[10:07]	<Huffalump2>	"fathefner, you want to make a directory off the file system root (/) called ""mnt"" (that's the name of the folder)"
[positive]	[10:07]	<craigp84>	Any major issues surfacing yet from the new release? - just before i upgrade :-)
[neutral]	[10:07]	<eternaljoy>	Jordan_U: I seen them sell USB 1GIG sticks that apparetly fools the PC into thinking you installed another 1 GIG physical RAM
[negative]	[10:07]	<Fathefner>	ok will do
[positive]	[10:07]	<Huffalump2>	PriceChild, I'm with ya... one step at a time, though
[neutral]	[10:07]	<hendaus>	somobody help me please!
[neutral]	[10:07]	<Jordan_U>	what_if, You need to blacklist it
[negative]	[10:08]	<PriceChild>	eternaljoy, you can use flash drives as ram
[neutral]	[10:08]	<PriceChild>	eternaljoy, well swap
[negative]	[10:08]	<what_if>	Jordan_U: is that a full blacklist or just a boottime blacklist, it needs to load later
[positive]	[10:08]	<allquixotic>	Scunizi: I found a solution to my problem, a very good one. idjc (Internet DJ Control) is an *excellent* streamer that supports ShoutCast :) I am running JACK on top of dmix in non-realtime, high-latency mode (which is OK for this application) to host the stream. @HLINK:8000/listen.pls :D

[positive]	[10:09]	<sanityx>	Any idea why feisty would hang in both the alternate install and live cds after detecting the cdrom as hda
[negative]	[10:09]	<eternaljoy>	PriceChild: I alraady have a 700MB linux swap partiton on my HDD.  Is that the same thing as  these USB sticks that they claim will fool my PC into thinking I added another physical 1 Gig RAM?
[negative]	[10:09]	<Fathefner>	ok i made an mnt
[negative]	[10:09]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, now how many ntfs drives do we want to mount here?  only one or multiple?
[negative]	[10:09]	<PriceChild>	eternaljoy, basically yes
[negative]	[10:09]	<Jordan_U>	eternaljoy, And if those do anything they either actually use them for swap or slow your machine down incredibly because what your machine thinks is RAM ( incredibly fast ) is actually just flash ( faster than HDD but still slow )
[negative]	[10:09]	<SnakePlisken>	cant help you there....i just hit enter for everything till i get to screen resolutions. sorry man
[negative]	[10:09]	<Fathefner>	2
[negative]	[10:09]	<Teres_>	i really am havinjg a problem with starcraft on wine...can anyone help?
[negative]	[10:09]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, for each drive you want to mount, create a folder/directory inside of /mnt/  such as... /mnt/windows_C  or  /mnt/mynetworkdrive etc
[positive]	[10:09]	<Scunizi>	allquixotic:  listing now.. cool.. nice job.
[negative]	[10:09]	<OiPenguinn>	SnakePlisken: I'll give that a go then.
[negative]	[10:10]	<silver6>	Teres_, whats the problem. i got it working first try
[negative]	[10:10]	<PriceChild>	eternaljoy, basically you can create a swap file on the flash disk. Windows does the same thing with it pagefiles in vista
[positive]	[10:10]	<Scunizi>	allquixotic:  it's a little overdriven.. litte distortion.
[negative]	[10:10]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, I had three.  What I did, for example, was windows_C, windows_F, and windows_H but you use whatever makes sense to you
[positive]	[10:10]	<allquixotic>	Scunizi: Will work on that - you may notice a difference within 2 minutes ;)
[neutral]	[10:10]	<Scunizi>	k
[negative]	[10:10]	<Jordan_U>	what_if, is it from the repos or from Nvidia.com?
[positive]	[10:10]	<Teres_>	i also did...but now when i start it it is in a small window and i cant get it fullscreen
[negative]	[10:10]	<Fathefner>	i cant make a folder
[neutral]	[10:10]	<what_if>	Jordan_U: nvidia.com

[negative]	[10:12]	<Jordan_U>	what_if, It sounds like a conflict between the ones you installed from Nvidia.com and the ones in the repos, did you blacklist the ones from the repos ( should have been one of the steps in whatever guide you followed ) ?
[neutral]	[10:12]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, open up a terminal

[negative]	[10:13]	<lomez>	so XGL/Compiz on ATI, does it work alright or is it not worth the trouble?
[negative]	[10:13]	<huma>	has anyone tried bluez-btsco 0.50 on 7.04?
[neutral]	[10:13]	<SnakePlisken>	do a google search for  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg....read up on it...cant help you anymore than that bro

[neutral]	[10:16]	<shane634>	tunganet, yes

[positive]	[10:16]	<PriceChild>	tunganet, because you will have a new kernel
[neutral]	[10:16]	<tunganet>	i hope it wouldn't be a hazle
[negative]	[10:16]	<Fathefner>	ok
[neutral]	[10:16]	<flodine>	can i get help with fontconfig configuration please
[negative]	[10:16]	<PriceChild>	tunganet, switch to vesa then use the restricted-manager

[neutral]	[10:16]	<shane634>	Scunizi, yes you can
[negative]	[10:16]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner does that look right?  so, /dev/hda/da200 /mnt/windows_C ntfs-3g
[negative]	[10:16]	<tunganet>	PriceChild: hmm okay
[neutral]	[10:16]	<what_if>	"Jordan_U: I put ""rmmod nvidia"" in rc.local and everything works fine now... a hack but a working hack"
[negative]	[10:16]	<begleysm>	im still in 6.10... but i have a 3 monitor setup and my middle monitor is stuck at 800x600 resolution even though xorg.conf only has 1280x1024 as an option... any ideas?
[negative]	[10:17]	<Nrbelex>	Hi, Inside my Dell 8200 is a Dell Truemobile 1180 aka BCM4303 wireless card. When I use the Network Manager, nothing is detected though I know two wireless networks are present (another computer one foot away has a strong connection on one of the two and an OK connection on the other). Any thoughts?
[negative]	[10:17]	<Fathefner>	bash: /dev/hda/da200: No such file or directory
[neutral]	[10:17]	<eternaljoy>	eck: do you?
[positive]	[10:17]	<eck>	eternaljoy: the seek time is the time it takes for the head to move across the platter
[neutral]	[10:17]	<shane634>	begleysm, the monitor can't handle it
[negative]	[10:17]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, sorry I got ahead of myself.  We want that command later when you automount.  My mistake.
[negative]	[10:17]	<Jordan_U>	tunganet, I would personally remove what envy installed and use the drivers from the repos, in Feisty they couldn't be easier to install and you won't have upgrade problems later on
[negative]	[10:17]	<flodine>	can someone tell me what fonts show better bitstream or truetype
[negative]	[10:17]	<eck>	eternaljoy: it doesn't make a lot of sense unless you sort of understand what is going on
[positive]	[10:17]	<allquixotic>	Scunizi: Not sure if it has an equalizer, but it does have about everything else, lol
[negative]	[10:17]	<jcreedy2>	Can anyone very experienced with an install with an ATI Radeon card PM me, I can't even get installer to start
[neutral]	[10:17]	<eck>	eternaljoy: seek time is like latency, transfer rate is like bandwidth
[negative]	[10:17]	<tunganet>	Jordan_U: is it really easy to install nvidia drivers without envy script in feisty?
[negative]	[10:17]	<Fathefner>	ok
[negative]	[10:17]	<tom_>	Can someone help me get my resolution changed and get electric sheep installed please? I just finished getting beryl up and running

[positive]	[10:18]	<Jordan_U>	tunganet, Yup, just a checkbox :)
[positive]	[10:18]	<begleysm>	shane634, it can handle it, it does in windows XP and it DID in ubuntu... just one day i started up ubuntu (i made no changes to xorg.conf) and its resolution was wrong
[negative]	[10:18]	<tunganet>	Jordan_U: oh my.. nice!
[neutral]	[10:18]	<nickuzzy>	my xserver is crashing upon startup
[neutral]	[10:18]	<phoenix_G>	anyone made atheros chipset device work on feisty ?
[negative]	[10:18]	<jcreedy2>	I get to the front screen, i go to start or install ubuntu, then get a black screen
[neutral]	[10:18]	<Jordan_U>	tunganet, But it won't work until you undu what envy did.
[negative]	[10:18]	<ejoy>	eck: ah ok cheers.  I read that a HDD has faster data transfer rate than a USB flash drive has.  But the USB flash drives seek time is faster!  is that true?
[neutral]	[10:18]	<what_if>	I there a seveas repository for feisty yet ??
[neutral]	[10:18]	<ammiel>	Is there a way I can make ubuntu go back to the old style of mounting (so the drive always mounts on /media/cdrom0 or /media/cdrom1 and not something such as /mnt/STARCRAFT)
[negative]	[10:18]	<tunganet>	Jordan_U: hmm so other data i have on 6.10 will get transfered nicely, and the only thing i need to do before i upgrade is to uninstall the envy right?
[negative]	[10:18]	<jcreedy2>	i went to graphics-safe install, showed loading screen for a while, then stopped outputting to monitor completely
[neutral]	[10:19]	<Jordan_U>	tunganet, Yup

[positive]	[10:19]	<Seveas>	what_if, no :)
[negative]	[10:19]	<tunganet>	Jordan_U: none of those WINE stuff needs any work right
[negative]	[10:19]	<eck>	ejoy: yes. because a hard drive needs to physically move a head across the platter to seek to a location on the disk, but a flash drive is not mechanical so it can just address any part of it directly
[neutral]	[10:19]	<Huffalump2>	fathefner, how many partitions are on hda?

[negative]	[10:26]	<auridius>	Hi, i don't find anything on the ubuntu docs for enabling 3D acceleration on an ATI rage mobility march64?
[neutral]	[10:26]	<cedricshock>	BrokenLinux: KDE, which is in kubuntu, and XFCE, which is in xubuntu
[negative]	[10:26]	<Huffalump>	nickuzzy, when it asks you if you want to diagnose, select OK, and find some error details.  unfortunately, there's a variety of problems all different.
[negative]	[10:27]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: i cant send a Pm because i need to register
[positive]	[10:27]	<BrokenLinux>	jrd, Amarok works fine in gnome?

[negative]	[10:27]	<OiPenguinn>	SnakePlisken: I figured how to continue editing, and I've verifed that additional resolutions are addedd to the config file. What do I need to do to make them appear in System --> Screen resolutions?
[neutral]	[10:27]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, use @HLINK
[negative]	[10:27]	<cedricshock>	BrokenLinux: Oops, read your message wrong, sorry. I use Amarok in gnome.
[positive]	[10:27]	<AATDark>	BrokenLinux: yeah of course it works fine ..
[negative]	[10:27]	<LjL>	tom__: i wonder how that's possible. you can always restore your previous X configuration from the terminal. just type  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup  before doing anything, and then if you have trouble, login to the terminal, and type  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf .   it's certainly always a good idea to make a backup of things you edit

[neutral]	[10:28]	<Nrbelex>	Any thoughts?
[positive]	[10:28]	<LjL>	mfyz: but /boot/grub/menu.lst *does* list the partition's UUID, you should change it to reflect the new UUID i think (besides... you did what?! changed the UUID?)
[neutral]	[10:28]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: @HLINK
[negative]	[10:28]	<benja_>	anybody have an idea what to do?
[neutral]	[10:28]	<ernstan>	is there something new with ubuntu 7.04?
[positive]	[10:28]	<delire>	xtknight: rsync ;) ?
[neutral]	[10:28]	<AATDark>	BrokenLinux: but its quite big i think  because of the kde libs
[negative]	[10:28]	<xtknight>	jrib, yeah it's just odd. i mean i can't move everything in the current dir?  (when i did mv ./* ./old_docs it didnt copy the .* files.  i just found that weird)
[neutral]	[10:28]	<nuOpus>	nrbelex i got mine working on my dell
[negative]	[10:28]	<xtknight>	since when did ./* not match ./.* ?
[neutral]	[10:28]	<BrokenLinux>	AATDark, yea, those are downloading now
[negative]	[10:28]	<Jordan_U>	markus_, Yes, do you know how to chroot? ( and how to bind /dev and /proc ) ?
[negative]	[10:29]	<Nrbelex>	nuOpus, what did you have to do and is it a BCM4303?
[negative]	[10:29]	<oneseventeen>	I changed my IP from dhcp to static using the GUI but it didn't apply it... how do I get my networking systems to implement my new IP settings?
[negative]	[10:29]	<nuOpus>	I had to remove the bcm43xx module that is loaded at start, then use NDISWRAPPER with the windows drivers
[negative]	[10:29]	<jrib>	xtknight: * does not glob things that start with a .
[negative]	[10:29]	<cedricshock>	Is there anything I can do to get the live CD to run with about 224 MB of memory? I have another memory stick, but it's got bad spots.
[negative]	[10:29]	<Mr_Bunny_>	What's the default home directory for the Java2 SDK 1.4.2?
[neutral]	[10:29]	<nuOpus>	yes
[positive]	[10:29]	<markus_>	Jordan_U, yes thanks... done it before
[positive]	[10:29]	<AATDark>	ernstan: layout : no ; new kernel ; new openoffec ; xserver .. + network manager
[neutral]	[10:29]	<oneseventeen>	(/etc/networking/interfaces has the correct IP)
[negative]	[10:29]	<AATDark>	ernstan: nothing big i would say ..
[negative]	[10:29]	<Nrbelex>	nuOpus, any way to do it without NDISWrapper?
[positive]	[10:29]	<LjL>	cedricshock: the live CD should definitely work with 224 MB of memory. (what do memory sticks have to do with it?)
[neutral]	[10:29]	<nuOpus>	ndiswrapper won't work at first because bcm43xx is loaded first
[negative]	[10:29]	<sls_>	Is there a good guide to setingup pam_mount? I really want to set it up to mount : volume * smb hathor & /home/HADES/& uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750,workgroup=HADES - - (except that it does not work at all! This is how I understand that the man page wants me to do it... ideas??)
[neutral]	[10:29]	<Jordan_U>	Nrbelex, Yes, are you on Edgy or Feisty?
[positive]	[10:29]	<nuOpus>	dont know. but it is working perfectly
[negative]	[10:29]	<nickuzzy>	Huffalump, the error occurs even when I try to run the live cd... im guess I should probably just go back to 6.10
[neutral]	[10:29]	<AATDark>	cedricshock there is a xubuntu .. with doesn't so much mem
[neutral]	[10:29]	<kane77>	cedricshock, try xubuntu
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Nrbelex>	Jordan_U, Feisty
[negative]	[10:30]	<LjL>	cedricshock: ah you mean RAM stick, i was thinking USB stick sorry, i'm stoned
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, these are USB drives?
[negative]	[10:30]	<cedricshock>	LjL: They let me have more memory. It certainly doesn't work with 224.
[negative]	[10:30]	<nuOpus>	I just need to figure out how to stop the module from loading when I boot
[negative]	[10:30]	<mfyz>	LjL: how can i generate UUIDs?
[positive]	[10:30]	<delire>	ernstan: migration assistant, codec installation on filetype, network manager, nvidia/ati magic, improved wifi support..
[neutral]	[10:30]	<LjL>	cedricshock: but anyway, the CD can run with 192MB in my experience
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Fathefner>	oo
[negative]	[10:30]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, apparently they are not NTFS in any event.
[negative]	[10:30]	<jrib>	xtknight: if you happen to use zsh, you can use *(D), otherwise you need to do list * and .*
[neutral]	[10:30]	<xtknight>	mfyz, uuidgen
[negative]	[10:30]	<jcreedy2>	Okay, so the problem is, I get to the boot screen with the Ubuntu CD, but after I select any option, it takes a long time to load, and then stops outputting to my monitor whatsoever. I'm using an ATI Radeon X700 Sapphire. Any ideas?
[positive]	[10:30]	<Fathefner>	i still have one pluged in
[negative]	[10:30]	<hossy>	shane634: gah, i installed ndiswrapper with the correct driver and what not, no dice, it isn't recognizing any wireless ap's
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Mr_Bunny_>	how can I search my filesystem for a file from command line?
[positive]	[10:30]	<mfyz>	hmm ok :)
[negative]	[10:30]	<xtknight>	"mfyz, if you want UUIDs for a harddisk, use ""blkid"".  uuidgen makes random ones"
[negative]	[10:30]	<Jordan_U>	Nrbelex, If you havn't messed with anything else ( like trying and failing to use NDIS wrapper ) just install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[neutral]	[10:30]	<kerik>	nobody ever tried to get an error message upon updating?
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Fathefner>	wow
[neutral]	[10:30]	<LjL>	"mfyz: why ""generate"" them? they're automated calculated by an appropriate algorithm, keep the ones that were generated for you"

[neutral]	[10:30]	<Fathefner>	i have them pluged it
[negative]	[10:31]	<nickv111>	Holy crap that's a lot of people here.
[negative]	[10:31]	<pimpnasty>	so is there a command to make it go in window mode?
[negative]	[10:31]	<Nrbelex>	Jordan_U, I haven't messed with anything - is that the name of the package?
[neutral]	[10:31]	<Fathefner>	it talks about a 60gb
[neutral]	[10:31]	<xtknight>	i've found ls /dev/disk/by-uuid to be more verbose
[neutral]	[10:31]	<stefg>	!uuid > stefg
[neutral]	[10:31]	<xtknight>	than blkid
[neutral]	[10:31]	<Mr_Bunny_>	pimpnasty: startx
[negative]	[10:31]	<cedricshock>	LjL: Yeah, that's the quoted number. With 224 it thrashes the CD loading nautilus, and never advances (never being more than a couple hours).
[neutral]	[10:31]	<slackern>	jcreedy2: you could try using the alternate installation disc, that will not have a graphical installation though but may work better.
[neutral]	[10:31]	<Jordan_U>	Nrbelex, Yes
[positive]	[10:31]	<Huffalump>	nickuzzy, well, I'm no expert on this topic.  I responded because I had some difficulties myself along those lines, but I learned that different people had different causes.  Hence... the desire to know more.
[negative]	[10:31]	<LjL>	Mr_Bunny_:  find / | grep keyword , or  locate filename  but only if the file's been there for the last day at least
[neutral]	[10:31]	<pimpnasty>	startx ?
[negative]	[10:31]	<peter77>	how/where do I enable mipmapping in beryl?

[negative]	[10:31]	<xtknight>	i'm not sure
[negative]	[10:31]	<Nrbelex>	Jordan_U, thanks - I'm giving it a try - why does this need to be done... why isn't it automatic?
[negative]	[10:31]	<pimpnasty>	like I have cedaga

[negative]	[10:32]	<LjL>	cedricshock: are you sure it's not a problem of corrupted CD (or picky drive) rather than RAM? i'm not just quoting official figures, i *have* run the (edgy) CD on 192 megs
[positive]	[10:32]	<pimpnasty>	so I can switch desktops
[neutral]	[10:32]	<nuOpus>	nrbelex its not done automatically in Windows either. LOL
[neutral]	[10:32]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: it have a 60gb a 40gb and a 200gb
[negative]	[10:32]	<nuOpus>	windows has no support for our cards
[positive]	[10:32]	<nickv111>	Guys, are there mirrors out there of the Ubuntu repository?
[negative]	[10:32]	<tom__>	LjL, it didn't change my screen resolution I selected nVidia and 1650 by 1050
[negative]	[10:32]	<xtknight>	"jrib, ah so something like ""zsh cp ./*(D) ./old_docs""  ??"
[neutral]	[10:32]	<peter77>	Thanx Jordan_U
[neutral]	[10:32]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: it have a 60gb a 40gb and a 200gb the 40gb has ubuntu on it

[negative]	[10:32]	<nickv111>	I need to install stuff but the servers are too loaded.
[neutral]	[10:32]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, so which one is a drive you'd like to try?  the 60gb first or a different one?
[negative]	[10:32]	<Enselic_>	How do I update the hostname after I have edited /etc/hostname?

[neutral]	[10:32]	<nickv111>	"Enselic_: Run ""hostname"""
[positive]	[10:32]	<mfyz>	xtknight: because, i changed in fstab and grub`s menu.lst and now kernel not booting. i want to change it back again :) dpkg-reconfigure not worked..
[positive]	[10:32]	<LjL>	tom__: that's fine, it means that it has made a backup for you (called /etc/X11/xorg.conf.20070420163052). if you also had made a backup yourself, you're twice as safe ;)

[negative]	[10:33]	<Narf__>	whoops, sorry - didn't think about pasting
[negative]	[10:34]	<xtknight>	Xyon, what kind of platform are you running?
[negative]	[10:34]	<LjL>	tom__: well, hardly anything is going to change unless you restart it. ctrl+alt+backspace, and if it doesn't start, do what i said you should do in case of a problem.
[negative]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	"what do you mean by ""platform"""
[neutral]	[10:34]	<dregin>	"hey, can anyone help me with an xorg.conf/nvidia problem? upgraded to feisty earlier today and x cant start giving me an error saying ""no screens found""..."
[negative]	[10:34]	<xtknight>	Xyon, motherboard, CPU, architecture (i'm assuming x86)
[negative]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	I am running an AMD64 3700+
[negative]	[10:34]	<lmosher>	How does one identify what Ubuntu version they have?
[neutral]	[10:34]	<xtknight>	lmosher, lsb_release -a
[negative]	[10:34]	<Jordan_U>	Xyon, What happens when you try to boot a liveCD?
[neutral]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	mobo is nvidia nForce
[neutral]	[10:34]	<xtknight>	 and 'uname -a' for kernel version
[negative]	[10:34]	<what_if>	dregin: try rmmod nvidia, then starting X
[neutral]	[10:34]	<xtknight>	Xyon, nforce what?
[negative]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	it crashes or displays nothing
[positive]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	hold on, lemme think about it
[negative]	[10:34]	<Nrbelex>	Jordan_U, is there any need for a restart? I'm not seeing anything new in the Network Monitor
[neutral]	[10:34]	<Xyon>	been a whiel
[positive]	[10:35]	<dregin>	what_if: kk, thanks.
[positive]	[10:35]	<stefg>	Hmmm... !uuid is a very interesting factoid. Now i know where all the misbehaving in my system with stock-ubuntu-kernels come from. We re all guinea-pigs for libata-pata. Nice that I'm being told :-)

[negative]	[10:35]	<lmosher>	Ok, so I'm on 6.10, what's the most recomended way to upgrade to fiesty?
[negative]	[10:35]	<xtknight>	"Xyon, ah well google ""PC Wizard"" if you cant remember.  i'd like to know the model # of your motherboard, ideally."
[negative]	[10:35]	<Narf__>	so, how can I load that 'MD subsystem' ?
[negative]	[10:35]	<Jordan_U>	Nrbelex, You can either restart or run: sudo modprobe bcm43xx
[neutral]	[10:35]	<Dumahen>	how can i reach the shared files on network by consol ?
[neutral]	[10:35]	<dregin>	what_if: module nvidia does not exist in /proc/modules

[neutral]	[10:35]	<adam_>	if anyone has the time, i have a wpa question about fiesty
[neutral]	[10:35]	<ubotu>	lmosher, use update-manager as described in the following: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:35]	<nuOpus>	rmmod ndiswrapper
[negative]	[10:35]	<pleed>	hi! really need help! tried to upgrade on feisty but failed. now there re a lot of malfunctions... how can i reconfigure whole ubuntu?
[negative]	[10:35]	<nuOpus>	whoops sorry
[neutral]	[10:35]	<Dumahen>	how can i reach the shared files on network by consol ?
[negative]	[10:35]	<cedricshock>	LjL: I'm sure it'd run with some swap space, but that's not an option. Hmm, I might need to tryu some other live CD for the data recovery part of this. I tried knoppix, but it didn't like my firewire drive (ubuntu likes it just fine).
[negative]	[10:35]	<what_if>	dregin: that could be the problem, did you use the ones from nVidia webpage or in apt ?
[negative]	[10:36]	<xtknight>	pleed, if you /really/ /really/ /really/ want to, `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a`
[neutral]	[10:36]	<Jordan_U>	!ask | adam
[positive]	[10:36]	<ubotu>	adam: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive]	[10:36]	<xtknight>	pleed, i just dont recommend it, that's all
[neutral]	[10:36]	<lmosher>	jrib, lol thanks... I was checking that as I asked, should have checked first. Thanks, and thanks xtknight also..
[positive]	[10:36]	<blazemonger>	the live cd detected my ide pata drives as scsi devices
[negative]	[10:36]	<pleed>	why not xtknight?
[negative]	[10:36]	<adam_>	lol, i asked it and didnt see an answer so i asked if i could ask it to get attention, lol
[positive]	[10:36]	<Nrbelex>	Jordan_U, Brilliant, it worked! What did the last command I just did do? - THANKS!
[negative]	[10:36]	<cedricshock>	pleed: How did it fail?
[negative]	[10:36]	<phobiac>	I need to set all the files and directories in one directory to be owned by one user, how can I do this?
[positive]	[10:36]	<CirroX>	damn I love 7.04
[neutral]	[10:36]	<stefg>	blazemonger: see my comment above
[negative]	[10:36]	<xtknight>	pleed, because it's probably more than you want to do for something that could be a simple problem.  and it might screw something up.
[negative]	[10:36]	<dregin>	what_if: I actually did apt-get remove nvidia-glx already...
[positive]	[10:36]	<CirroX>	it's very good
[negative]	[10:36]	<adam_>	do we still need to do a text file for wired wpa in fiesty
[neutral]	[10:36]	<jrib>	phobiac: what directory?
[negative]	[10:36]	<phobiac>	I'm trying to make sense of chmod but it's confusing
[negative]	[10:36]	<annihilus>	anyone have a solution to XServer not starting (No Screens Found), Im running at radeon x1300
[neutral]	[10:36]	<pleed>	dont know cause there was no exactly error message
[negative]	[10:36]	<LjL>	cedricshock: there are live CDs around that are made specifically for data recovery purposes... not that i have names in my mind right now but
[neutral]	[10:36]	<xtknight>	phobiac, what confuses you about it?
[negative]	[10:37]	<xtknight>	phobiac, the manual page can be frustratingly awful
[negative]	[10:37]	<dregin>	what_if: Should I be using the apt drivers or the proprietary ones?
[negative]	[10:37]	<Jordan_U>	Nrbelex, It loaded the driver again, which now works because the firmware is available
[negative]	[10:37]	<cedricshock>	blazemongeR: Are they on a usb pata controller like jMicron?

[neutral]	[10:39]	<liquiddoom>	Okay, thanks.
[neutral]	[10:39]	<blazemonger>	what is the alternate install good for?
[negative]	[10:39]	<Xyon>	i def have over 256mb of ram, but there are other reasons to use alt cd?
[neutral]	[10:39]	<xtknight>	!alternate | blazemonger
[positive]	[10:39]	<ubotu>	"blazemonger: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an ""expert"" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a ""Live"" CD."

[neutral]	[10:40]	<jbardin_>	 /msg nickserv link jbardin 123iop
[negative]	[10:40]	<pleed>	xtknight hm i ll try to upgrade under apt-get
[negative]	[10:40]	<Enselic_>	kane77: when there are major releases it might take longer
[negative]	[10:40]	<tom_>	LjL, i don't think so, it was like restart X server... you asked me if i had done it yet, and I hadnt so i typed it into the terminal and bang it started looking for settings or something but it didn't do anything so I eventually ctrl alt delted to restart
[neutral]	[10:40]	<Shauny>	"anybody an ""expert"" IN pam?"
[positive]	[10:40]	<Jordan_U>	Xyon, It just tends to work when the LiveCD doesn't
[neutral]	[10:40]	<eck>	kane77: packages are upgraded to new versions only when there is a new version -- within a version there are just security fixes and major bugs
[negative]	[10:40]	<Xyon>	once i select start or install ubuntu, how long does it typically take for something to show up?
[negative]	[10:40]	<Wiseguy>	hey guys, does anyone know why i wouldnt be able to access the windows share i have on my network? for some reason it says the contents cannot be displayed, possibly because the contents have been deleted. (although i know they havent)  anyone have any ideas?
[negative]	[10:40]	<LjL>	tom_: well, i had told you to hit ctrl+alt+backspace. if that wasn't what you did, then it could hardly work correctly. anyway, are you sure that now - even though the resolution is the same - you cannot go to System / Preferences / Display (or what it's called) and select a higher one?
[neutral]	[10:40]	<eck>	kane77: thunderbird 2 will most likely _not_ appear in feisty
[negative]	[10:40]	<blazemonger>	my friend who used to be a windows nazi now likes linux cuz of ubuntu
[negative]	[10:40]	<AATDark>	Xyon: not very long
[neutral]	[10:40]	<ScrAm>	I just downloaded and installed Ubuntu 7.04 yesterday from my Ubuntu 6.10, and now pretty much everything I start freezes.

[neutral]	[10:40]	<ScrAm>	Firefox, xmms
[negative]	[10:40]	<kane77>	eck, why not? :(
[neutral]	[10:40]	<AATDark>	Xyon: if you doesn't see anything something is wron
[neutral]	[10:41]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, I'm going to be stepping away, so... listen, ntfs-3g works great.  I've used it on regular hard drives inside the box, but if you've got USB drives then I did just search around and found this killer tutorial -> @HLINK that'll work in Feisty as well
[negative]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	well i went to graphics-safe install and it took about 5 mins for it to load
[neutral]	[10:41]	<Blubloblu>	Hi there, does anyone want to help me?
[negative]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	and then it just crashed
[neutral]	[10:41]	<Sgeo>	Where can I download a 6.10 alt. install disk?
[negative]	[10:41]	<AATDark>	Xyon: how long are you already waiting ?
[negative]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	i waited with a blank screen for about 5 mins
[neutral]	[10:41]	<stefg>	!download
[positive]	[10:41]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from @HLINK - Mirrors can be found at @HLINK
[negative]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	then i just restarted back to windows
[positive]	[10:41]	<eck>	kane77: because feisty is stable, introducing major software revisions and new features would not be stable
[negative]	[10:41]	<Huffalump>	fathefner, stick with ntfs-3g.  why only read when you can write?  it rocks.
[negative]	[10:41]	<tom_>	LjL, yeah i checked i am still stuck at 1024 by 768
[neutral]	[10:41]	<AATDark>	Xyon: do you have an ATI card?

[negative]	[10:41]	<Shauny>	help im getting error: pam_start() failed, error 26
[negative]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	i believe that's the source of the problem
[negative]	[10:41]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: ok will do i have to walk away too
[negative]	[10:41]	<blazemonger>	the ONLY thing i dont like about fiesty is the proprietary drivers
[neutral]	[10:41]	<Sgeo>	n/m I think
[neutral]	[10:41]	<Xyon>	what can i do to fix that?
[neutral]	[10:42]	<Fathefner>	Huffalump2: thank u
[neutral]	[10:42]	<Jordan_U>	Xyon, You can install the proprietary ati drivers ( fglrx )
[negative]	[10:42]	<LjL>	"tom_: what did you select when you were asked about your monitor's capabilities? (there were three choices, ""Simple"", ""Medium"" and ""Advanced"", i usually choose ""Medium"", since it allows me to just select the resolution i want at the desired refresh rate)"
[negative]	[10:42]	<Xyon>	okay, how do i do that before i even start ubuntu?
[positive]	[10:42]	<AATDark>	Xyon: but will be diffucalt if you cant boot :D
[positive]	[10:42]	<legolaswood>	Am i correct that we can download a small package named Kubuntu desktop to add KDE to ubuntu?
[negative]	[10:42]	<pimpnasty>	how can I alt tab in linux?
[neutral]	[10:42]	<Xyon>	yah
[neutral]	[10:42]	<Xyon>	lolo
[negative]	[10:42]	<blazemonger>	btw i have a rage 128 pro...the desktop efffects dont run
[neutral]	[10:42]	<cables>	pimpnasty, by hitting alt tab.
[neutral]	[10:42]	<ammiel>	Is there a way I can make ubuntu go back to the old style of mounting (so the drive always mounts on /media/cdrom0 or /media/cdrom1 and not something such as /mnt/STARCRAFT)
[negative]	[10:42]	<kerik>	hey there
[negative]	[10:42]	<LjL>	"legolaswood: it's not a ""small package""... but yes"
[neutral]	[10:42]	<cables>	pimpnasty, it should just work.
[neutral]	[10:42]	<LjL>	!kubuntu > legolaswood    (legolaswood, see the private message from Ubotu)
[positive]	[10:42]	<pimpnasty>	well I cant alt tab in this game
[negative]	[10:42]	<Xyon>	considering just giving up, all i wanted to do was try out compiz and xgl stuff
[neutral]	[10:42]	<xtknight>	ammiel, put it in fstab
[positive]	[10:42]	<Jordan_U>	Xyon, Install with the alternate install CD, no GUI == no problem installing :)
[negative]	[10:43]	<ubuntuserverguy>	could someone tell me a text editor in ubuntu server?

[negative]	[10:43]	<blazemonger>	other than that things seem to be going good so far during the install
[negative]	[10:43]	<eck>	pimpnasty: you probably have to use the left alt
[negative]	[10:43]	<cables>	Can anyone tell me how I can subscribe to podcasts in Amarok?
[positive]	[10:43]	<pimpnasty>	is there a command for windowed mod?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<cedricshock>	LjL: If I boot the alternate install CD, can I get a nice fluffy console?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<cables>	ubuntuserverguy, nano
[positive]	[10:43]	<ubuntuserverguy>	thanks
[positive]	[10:43]	<Xyon>	i'm guessing altCD is also 700mb?
[positive]	[10:43]	<ubuntuserverguy>	:)
[neutral]	[10:43]	<xtknight>	putting it in fstab disables gnome-hal-mounter for that block device, does it not?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<xtknight>	Xyon, yes
[negative]	[10:43]	<LjL>	cedricshock: console, yes, nice and fluffy, i wouldn't say so - most commands are missing
[neutral]	[10:43]	<Xyon>	cuz.... i'm on a capped network here
[negative]	[10:43]	<Shauny>	eck, do you know what it means by: pam_start() failed, error 26
[negative]	[10:43]	<tom_>	LjL, it asked me what out of a list of things did i think my video card was ... i picked nvidia... most of the other ones seemed like random letters
[positive]	[10:43]	<Shaddox>	Where can I download the DVD release of ubuntu feisty? Noone's seeding the torrent...X_x
[neutral]	[10:43]	<xtknight>	dont you get busybox

[neutral]	[10:43]	<AATDark>	Xyon: @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:43]	<LjL>	cedricshock: you can always boot the *live* cd in single user console mode, though! can't you?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<Xyon>	gonna blow my limit out of the water with 1400mb in a day

[negative]	[11:21]	<laurence_>	Hi, all! I've just got a new Samsung LCD TV, with VGA port on the back, so I've hooked one of my Ubuntu (Edgy) boxes up to it. Problem is, if I try to run it at 1360x768 (the native resolution), the screen cuts in and out about once per second or few. If I edit xorg.conf to use 800x600, then it works fine, although stretched. 1024x768 does the same as 1360x. Has anyone got any clues how to fix that?

[neutral]	[11:27]	<arthur_kalm>	does anyone know how to remove an nvidia driver installed from the nvidia website?
[neutral]	[11:27]	<eck>	starman: no, because of how gzip compressoin works

[negative]	[11:27]	<Supaplex>	starman: no. not unless you use fuse and write your own.

[negative]	[11:28]	<arthur_kalm>	i.e. the official nVidia driver, there doesn't seem to be anything in the readme that explains how to remove it
[neutral]	[11:28]	<Gunrun>	what does it have that the normal one doesn't?
[neutral]	[11:28]	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock : no stop ..
[negative]	[11:28]	<eck>	starman: so compressed filesystems are usually read only

[negative]	[11:28]	<LjL>	tom_ i'm afraid i don't really know much about beryl, but there are a couple of options, if i recall correctly, that you do need to add to xorg.conf for beryl to work with nvidia cards. those probably got removed by the reconfigure. ask in #ubuntu-effects
[neutral]	[11:28]	<Gunrun>	tom_ I only have rewritable DVDs

[negative]	[11:29]	<Gunrun>	that typing live will make it act like a live CD
[neutral]	[11:29]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, It automounts when plugged in.
[negative]	[11:29]	<starman>	you know what makes ubuntu still such a pain for noobs to switch over to ?  All the post install config
[negative]	[11:29]	<Gunrun>	otherwise its just an install
[positive]	[11:29]	<Supaplex>	starman: yes, lots of things, but not what you describe. :) even a tarball would be prone to resizing on changes. (unless the file content sizes were the same before and after)

[negative]	[11:40]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: More likely it is denying the 1920x1200 because it thinks something can't manage it (monitor, card etc)

[negative]	[11:48]	<Skiguy>	hey  everyone - I just upgraded to Feisty and I can't seem to get it to boot correctly. After the login screen I just get the orage background with a white squre in the upper left and it won't go any further. booting to recovery mode is no problem. I'm thinking an xorg.conf problem. any suggestions?
[negative]	[11:48]	<makuseru>	anyone know what the room for Ubuntu Studio is?
[negative]	[11:48]	<MrMakeveli>	zaphands, you had to play w/ alsamixer before you could get the playback to work correctly? do you mind telling me what did the trick?

[neutral]	[11:48]	<shakya>	anyone know why?
[negative]	[11:48]	<slackern>	kzm: just remove the symbolic links i guess should undo it?
[negative]	[11:48]	<Jordan_U>	shakya, You need to remove sun-java5-bin but unfortunately removing it will probably fail if the postinst script fails

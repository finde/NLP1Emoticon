[none]	[01:19]	<darnell>	no idea what 587 is

[none]	[01:19]	<underwatercow>	eck: so what do I do if I make a leading parition too small and need to resize? I won't be able to pull it from the next partition, will I?
[none]	[01:19]	<darnell>	ok, so i need port 25
[none]	[01:19]	<eck>	darnell: if you look at /etc/services it lists what services are associated with what ports

[none]	[01:21]	<ajehuk>	darnell - both are mail
[none]	[01:21]	<eck>	underwatercow: no, unfortunately not. If you were using lvm you could add more space, but ifyou are just doing a regular non-lvm setup you need to do it manually (i.e. back up everything, resize, restore everything)
[negative]	[01:21]	<BlueScreenKid>	yuckity ... yuckity .. yuck ... to get my ati 9600xt to work properly i had to use non-open source drivers ... where on edgy i could use open source .. why this backwards step :(

[none]	[01:21]	<BlueScreenKid>	IceGuest ... install kunbuntu .. instead of ubuntu
[none]	[01:21]	<eck>	Ademan: I believe it is done by setting it in your .gtkrc

[none]	[01:23]	<underwatercow>	Hor|zon: isn't it a good principle to leave half of the root/operating system free?

[none]	[01:26]	<arooni>	are there any apps that will be broken if i upgrade to feisty?

[positive]	[01:30]	<yigal>	BlueScreenKid: yes the entire filesystem is using SATA nomenclature now
[none]	[01:30]	<TomTheGeek>	Hey guys, anyone want to help me with trying to install ubuntu on  a fake raid 1?
[none]	[01:30]	<iain>	ajehuk> and restarting fixes it.
[none]	[01:30]	<BlueScreenKid>	yigal . ok tnx
[none]	[01:30]	<underwatercow>	eck: yeah, that was my next question... I was going to make home the rest of the drive.. .but if i store files on another drive, that would be pointless

[none]	[01:31]	<dimeotane>	anyone have truecrypt working under fesity?
[none]	[01:31]	<underwatercow>	eck: so 20GiB for root and home should be plenty for everything I'll ever want to install?
[none]	[01:31]	<yigal>	darnell: yes evolution has always had problem(s)
[none]	[01:31]	<randomwalker>	lando__: i guess you could manually add yourself in /etc/groups to all the groups you want

[none]	[01:31]	<darnell>	with sending mail?
[none]	[01:31]	<ajehuk>	iain - oh right - sorry, so all you are after is a restart of the sound system after hibernate... /etc/init.d/alsa reload should do that...
[none]	[01:31]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, right
[none]	[01:31]	<randomwalker>	lando__: but other than that i dunno
[none]	[01:31]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, it should be the same as the old one except for the device name
[none]	[01:31]	<zach>	hey can someone give me a hand with my sound in 7.04?
[none]	[01:31]	<darnell>	interesting, since its an email proggy

[none]	[01:33]	<ajehuk>	iain - sorry should be 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa restart'
[none]	[01:33]	<Beastage>	lol!
[positive]	[01:33]	<yigal>	Beastage: nice :)
[none]	[01:33]	<eck>	underwatercow: I think if you keep /var clean you probably won't go above 6 GB or so for / (not including /home), even if you have lots of packaged and development headers and whatnot
[none]	[01:33]	<iain>	ajehuk> and it returned 'Stopping alsa...... [ok]  starting alsa ..... [ok] ' but didn't fix the sound bug.
[none]	[01:33]	<Beastage>	yigal... pm
[negative]	[01:33]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, here is what my original fstab looks like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16933/
[none]	[01:33]	<eck>	underwatercow: then you have to add some space in that to prevent fragmentation and so forth
[none]	[01:33]	<wallydalla1>	tomthegeek,   it took me work to find it, but the 6.06 server cd is the one you want to find.  i will look for the URL.
[none]	[01:33]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the second to last one is for dump and the last one is for fsck
[none]	[01:33]	<dredhammer>	hello does anyone know how i get Feisty to recognize the linksys usb wireless adapter?
[none]	[01:33]	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  I see a red diamond there
[none]	[01:33]	<lando__>	yes theres a backup how do i run nautilus as root i 4got the command
[none]	[01:33]	<lando__>	gtksudo or sumthing
[none]	[01:34]	<iain>	ajehuk> the problem is that there's no such command (the alsa part)
[none]	[01:34]	<idefixx>	Gigi: right click on it - go to Select Windows Man. and chose Beryl
[none]	[01:34]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the last one tells fsck whether to check the partition if there was a bad shutdown etc.
[none]	[01:34]	<randomwalker>	lando__: gksudo nautilus?
[none]	[01:34]	<underwatercow>	eck: is there a defragmenter in linux then?

[none]	[01:35]	<nibsa1242b>	errorlevel its always good to at least have a seperate /home partition so that you don't loose your data if something terrible happens and you have to reinstall... plus it makes it easier to backup.  I prefer having /home /usr /boot /root and /var at a min
[positive]	[01:35]	<Gigi>	ok. it is done idefixx now I think that I have a small mess :P  I will keep on my own.  Thanks a lot man!!!!
[none]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	"ok i am getting miffed. Is there a ""how to unscrew-up and remove nvidia-drivers-issues-caused by once previously recommended scripts (envy) and use the new method which may not work???"
[none]	[01:35]	<idefixx>	Gigi: have fun!
[none]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: use the other person's nick while replying

[none]	[01:35]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, do i want suid or dev?
[none]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	cause right now, i have been back and forth between envy and this new great rstricted modules interface, and neither works now
[none]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: yeah, looks like you're screwed
[none]	[01:35]	<nibsa1242b>	atlantia loot at the script and manually undo what it does
[none]	[01:35]	<eck>	"underwatercow: no. at least for ext3, if you ever accidentally fill up the filesystem and want to defragment, you could run a script to move (well copy and then delete) files aroudn, since that will ""unfragment"" the files"
[none]	[01:35]	<underwatercow>	does linux have a defragmenter?
[none]	[01:35]	<underwatercow>	lol
[none]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	i cant get a shred of consistency to save my arse
[none]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: you can boot from the installer cd again and edit it

[none]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: suid
[none]	[01:36]	<wallydalla1>	nibsa1242b,  i wonder why the automatic ubuntu installer does not create a seperate partition for home folders?
[none]	[01:36]	<underwatercow>	eck: interesting
[none]	[01:36]	<lando__>	randomwalker: good idea
[none]	[01:36]	<lando__>	be right back
[none]	[01:36]	<tiglionabbit>	hello
[none]	[01:36]	<atlantia>	so yeah, it downloads and installs the nvidia automagic script
[none]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: I could have shown you the other stuff
[positive]	[01:36]	<iain>	ajehuk> I'm sure i can (i've done similar before)....but I'm not what the URL is to post it up at ;)
[none]	[01:36]	<effie_jayx>	"Beastage,  which do you mean... ""ati"" or ""radeon"" ??"
[none]	[01:36]	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: thanks for both of your help
[positive]	[01:36]	<eck>	underwatercow: i have read some talk about making it easier to defragment ext4, but if you are experiencing fragmentation it's usually becauseyou did something wrong in the first place
[none]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: uid is important
[none]	[01:36]	<jeef>	how can i swap which soundcard is my primary soundcard?

[negative]	[01:36]	<ajehuk>	iain - http://pastebin.ca will do
[none]	[01:36]	<dredhammer>	yigal it lists both the linksys adapter and the mouse

[none]	[01:37]	<yigal>	dredhammer: what card is it using?
[none]	[01:37]	<underwatercow>	eck: actually. One last question... which would you recommend? ext3 or Reiserfs?

[none]	[01:38]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, you just list them like a list
[none]	[01:38]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: of course, uid is good because if names change or strange things happen uid will always allow the computer to id the partition
[none]	[01:38]	<Alonea>	tiglionabbit: for ubuntu specific channels yeah. I also goto ##linux for help which is usually slow, though sometimes gets a rush
[none]	[01:38]	<tiglionabbit>	anyways, I was gonna ask--   Today, I checked my update manager and noticed the distro upgrade button.  Well I decided to upgrade everything on this distro before dist-upgrading, and that happened to include an upgrade for the update manager.

I would suggest there is a 50% chance of it being an issue with suspend and 50% problem with the driver..

[none]	[02:08]	<pavan>	hi! I am trying to install netbeans but it says it requires java 1.5 but instead is finding 1.4 version.. 1.4 is installed, so how do I change the path?
[none]	[02:08]	<Fylk>	ajehuk, help?
[none]	[02:08]	<nibsa1242b>	asdfasdf I think its a tad more complicated then that you have to make the flash drive bootable or something and you might even need a special iso I don't remember I'm still looking so I don't want to say something incorrect
[none]	[02:08]	<wallydalla1>	what is easyubuntu?   is that like automatix
[none]	[02:08]	<stefg>	wallydalla1: getting a proper sources.list and using apt is cleaner and quicker

[none]	[02:08]	<asdfasdf>	yea
[none]	[02:08]	<spikeb>	wallydalla1: yes, only it doesn't suck as much.
[none]	[02:08]	<Ax4>	pavan, add your new path in there
[none]	[02:08]	<LjL>	wallydalla1: why not just install them with the tool that's been provided since forever - APT? google earth is available from the medibuntu repository, same (i think) for real player, java is available in the official repositories
[none]	[02:09]	<wallydalla1>	ok, sucks less.  good.   i will google that now
[none]	[02:09]	<badkitty>	Automatix broke my system bad and I lost lots of time (especially cause I had beryl working after many issues)

[none]	[02:58]	<eck>	mistaWAC: we used to use openvpn at work, had clients on linux/windows/mac
[none]	[02:58]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: then you must first mount the partition holding the iso file

[none]	[02:59]	<NobleCommerc1>	cabajgtr: i've never moved an install from one drive to another though, that may not work at all

[positive]	[03:02]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: for client, you don't use /etc/exports at all! you mount using the command-line, or, if you want it permanent, via /etc/fstab
[none]	[03:02]	<debaser>	Fylk: anyway I can reinstall from scratch after backing up but this is much faster.

[none]	[03:03]	<debaser>	mkinitrd
[none]	[03:04]	<mistaWAC>	okay
[none]	[03:04]	<randomwalker>	debaser: i've never tried this, but try booting from cd, mounting your / directory, removing the cd's /bin and /usr/bin from your $PATH and replacing them with the /bin and /usr/bin on the hosed system, and run apt-get. hopefully it'll be as if you're running on the old system

[none]	[03:09]	<kbrooks>	stefg, i wonder if he is cooperating at all
[none]	[03:09]	<wastrel>	ozymandias:  the ubuntu install disk doesn't contain kde packages.  you need the kubuntu install disk for that.

[none]	[03:10]	<ozymandias>	wastrel i have an active net connection during install though, why download a 700meg iso rather than the 10 meg of kde packages? and even if i install it after i install the image, i still haev to deal with gnome being installed, as i was never givien an option during the install to NOT install gnome.
[none]	[03:10]	<Fylk>	iirc?

[none]	[03:14]	<dunstabulos_>	i have installed swat, do i need xinetd to run it?

[none]	[03:17]	<debaser>	Stormx2: I don't really enjoy classical music as much as prog rock, but it's fun to play it and I think it's a good step before playing prog rock, space rock or things like that

[none]	[03:17]	<Impaque>	yell0w: sudo /etc/init.d/portmap stop
[none]	[03:18]	<Kevin>	how do i shutdown x
[none]	[03:18]	<witless>	randomc0de: actually the biggest problem is that when i switch away from my desktop (eg alt-f1 into terminal) and them come back, i see nothign but a black screen and the mouse pointer (which i can move around)
[none]	[03:18]	<Impaque>	yell0w: but it will break nfs (if you have some dirs mounted etc.)

[none]	[03:18]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: That didn't work either, but I found out that if I type the su command and enter my root password it says it won't let me too, is that normal?  When I enter the password for sudo it works ok

[none]	[03:53]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, i have config editor open now, we can just try metacity
[positive]	[03:53]	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: There are methods to get it to run in a 32-bit chroot, but they're entirely unsupported.
[none]	[03:53]	<kalifornia909>	anyone have any idea why ubuntu isnt writing a partition table to a raid array
[none]	[03:53]	<Korvak>	modumass, I will try adding my resolutions to xorg.conf right now.
[negative]	[03:53]	<blazemonger>	NemesisD: beryl i could care less.i would love the molecule saver to work

[none]	[03:55]	<alcane>	Fujitsu: thx, i've been there and the only error I've gotten is it not working. I've done installs of nspluginwrapper, alien, and every library I can find as well as copying every translated deb and libray into any directory that says that it even MIGHT need it. But, thx anyway
[none]	[03:55]	<justin64>	Kix: it seems to be a constan problem. on the X server I get an Audo CD icon, but there's no disk inserted.
[none]	[03:55]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, done
[none]	[03:55]	<blazemonger>	i'm willing to pay for a distro which will run rosegarden and which will configure my midi drivers for me

[none]	[03:55]	<Fujitsu>	blazemonger: MIDI is a touchy issue, unfortunately.
[none]	[03:55]	<eternalswd>	Fujitsu, yes, but alcane said 64-bit verion of firefox, not firefox on 64-bit, and that's what I was referring to

[none]	[03:56]	<KevinOoO>	ooh thanks

[positive]	[03:56]	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: Oh, true... nspluginwrapper should solve that, but apparently not.

[none]	[03:56]	<dudu1982>	can someone help me?
[none]	[03:56]	<blazemonger>	i like rosegarden's simple interface

[none]	[03:56]	<Fujitsu>	!helpme
[positive]	[03:56]	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[none]	[03:56]	<chrissturm>	does feisty not support lilo?
[negative]	[03:56]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, works in metacity :/
[none]	[03:57]	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: It does, but grub is generally used instead.
[none]	[03:57]	<dudu1982>	it's a long one..
[positive]	[03:57]	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, You could find the developers responsible for midi hardware support and donate testing time / money / hardware ( they can't make it work if they don't have it :)
[none]	[03:57]	<Fujitsu>	dudu1982: Nothing abnormal.
[positive]	[03:57]	<dudu1982>	hehehe :)
[negative]	[03:57]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
[none]	[03:57]	<blazemonger>	Jordan_U_:  i wouldnt mind even that

[none]	[03:58]	<blazemonger>	thing is intel's drivers for my soundcard only run from redhat and suse and it's this sh script with this wiierd   scrambled letters
[none]	[03:58]	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: Try removing the grub package.
[none]	[03:58]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, beryl is a cruel mistress
[none]	[03:58]	<kalifornia909>	is there a boot manager that will boot to a software raid array

[none]	[04:00]	<Kix>	justin64: Whats the output from 'mount'?
[none]	[04:00]	<rbrtoclto>	so I guess it's a system configuration thing?
[none]	[04:00]	<nils_>	It looks like nobody has found a solution for the mouse not working with Feisty on VirtualPC. Is is possible to revert the kernel from 2.6.20 to 2.6.17, or would that be a bad thing?
[none]	[04:00]	<Pelo>	rbrtoclto,  this occors on my keyb to because those signs are intended to go on top of other letters
[none]	[04:00]	<msand>	I'm trying to record audio streams, but can't seem to get audacity to record the output of my sound card.  Tried all the options for Recording Device in Preferences.. no luck.
[none]	[04:00]	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, Best be is probably to file a bug report at bugs.ubuntu.com and, if needed, offer your hardware for testing or to the developers. I would also suggest helping with testing Gutsy when it starts coming out as it is easier to encorperate changes early on
[none]	[04:00]	<tehquickness>	how do you mount a cd image in ubuntu?

[none]	[04:02]	<ardchoille>	!automatix
[none]	[04:02]	<sky_shark>	oh okay
[none]	[04:02]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[none]	[04:11]	<delmorep>	Impaque: nope, it was the cleanest compile possible, 4 steps
[none]	[04:11]	<Fujitsu>	!md5sum | zero88
[negative]	[04:11]	<ubotu>	zero88: To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM for more
[none]	[04:11]	<zero88>	Fujitsu its a game. its a .run file
[none]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, so the default in Feisty is no colors?
[none]	[04:11]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, and then reopen gnome-terminal or it won't register

[none]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, gotcha it works great now
[none]	[04:11]	<Impaque>	delmorep: then just do whatever you did, but instead of make install, type make uninstall
[none]	[04:11]	<rbrtoclto>	anyone know how to change font hinting preferences for KDE apps?
[positive]	[04:11]	<delmorep>	Impaque: awesome! thanks a million my friend :)
[none]	[04:12]	<Fujitsu>	rbrtoclto: -> Kubuntu
[none]	[04:12]	<Impaque>	delmorep: worked?
[none]	[04:12]	<Fujitsu>	#kubuntu, that is.
[none]	[04:12]	<zce>	Jordan_U_, on the properties of the connection there is this option, and is already disabled
[none]	[04:12]	<delmorep>	Impaque: yah, maybe i should try before I celebrate
[none]	[04:12]	<rbrtoclto>	fuj: I'm using Ubuntu with Gnome and just a couple of KDE apps
[none]	[04:13]	<sc0tch>	is there a way to import the current generic kernel config into an installed linux-source package?
[none]	[04:13]	<tehquickness>	also it is asking for a filesystem

[none]	[04:13]	<xtknight>	sc0re_, er /boot not ~/boot
[none]	[04:13]	<Johnny_>	just got a 400 gb harddrive will ubuntu support it
[none]	[04:13]	<delmorep>	Impaque: worked like a charm, maybe you're a good person to ask... this was my first compile... if i wanted to take my knowledge a step further, do you know of a good resource
[none]	[04:14]	<dager>	Johnny_: yes
[none]	[04:14]	<xtknight>	Johnny_, yes if your controller/bios does
[none]	[04:14]	<rbrtoclto>	I'll try in there
[none]	[04:14]	<huXfluX>	Hello all! Has anyone heard of such a problem? I've just installed festy fawn on a toshiba laptop and the sound volume is very low. I'm playing an mp3 and i can bearly hear it. The volumes are at max (volume control in gnome and alsamixer in CLI). The sound card is a Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02). What to do?
[none]	[04:14]	<Johnny_>	kk
[none]	[04:14]	<ardchoille>	what is the avahi-daemon for?
[none]	[04:14]	<Johnny_>	how do i check if my bios will
[none]	[04:14]	<Journeyman>	how do you read iptables logs?
[none]	[04:14]	<sc0tch>	worked perfect, thank you xtknight.
[none]	[04:14]	<rbrtoclto>	"so far Feisty has been way less painful than Edgy to get ""just right"""
[none]	[04:14]	<blazemonger>	who knows someone who can build a Digital Audio Workstation for me?
[none]	[04:14]	<Impaque>	delmorep: well, i learned my share from README files and ./configure --help.. also, reading the Makefile (after ./configure) gives a lot of hints
[none]	[04:15]	<blazemonger>	that uses professional toools like rosegarde
[none]	[04:15]	<xtknight>	"sc0tch, check out the ubuntu ""master kernel thread"" on the ubuntuforums (works great for me all the time)"
[none]	[04:15]	<xtknight>	if you're building a kernel..
[none]	[04:15]	<tehquickness>	can ubuntu mount an mdf image?
[none]	[04:15]	<Fujitsu>	tehquickness: Not directly, but mdf2iso can convert it to an ISO.
[none]	[04:15]	<delmorep>	Impaque: I hear ya, I guess the options are dependent on the program afterall, I will investigate new configurations now that I know how to uninstall
[none]	[04:15]	<tehquickness>	ok I will try that
[none]	[04:16]	<Tom47>	!avahi
[negative]	[04:16]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about avahi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[none]	[04:16]	<eternalswd>	dudu1982, if you already have a 20gb partition set apart for linux, then just install to that partition.  you'll need to reformat that partition to ext3 if you haven't already (the install disc should take care of that). and you need a small partition set aside for swap.  the partition for windows shouldn't be touched
[none]	[04:16]	<locke1689>	hey, does anyone have an HDBits account?
[none]	[04:16]	<Impaque>	delmorep: ofcourse, they are different for each program almost.. some of the programs will not configure without additional ./configure flags etc.. README should point that out..
[none]	[04:17]	<dauoalagio2>	how can i share folders wirelessly between two ubuntu computers?
[positive]	[04:17]	<cornel1>	"The command: gksu ""update-manager -c"" ,  that will use the appropriate version, that is, use 64  bit?"
[none]	[04:17]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, but I dont see what is wrong with them?
[none]	[04:17]	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh works well, but it might not be quite what you're looking for
[none]	[04:18]	<Jordan_U_>	cornel1, Yes
[none]	[04:18]	<delmorep>	Impaque: Ive used nothing but Ubuntu for almost a year, im just now starting to understand how useful the terminal is.... wget is awesome!  thanks for the information
[positive]	[04:18]	<Impaque>	delmorep: np ;)
[none]	[04:18]	<dauoalagio2>	dager, one can't start x, so i am trying to back everything up
[none]	[04:18]	<cornel1>	Thanks  Jordan_U_
[none]	[04:18]	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh is completely command-line, unless you get a frontend
[none]	[04:18]	<sky_shark>	i installed the ntfs-config tool but it only lets me select an external device and grays out the internal device
[positive]	[04:18]	<Jordan_U_>	delmorep, wget -c for bad connections ( will keep re-trying ) :)

[none]	[04:19]	<locke1689>	like it worked... then it didnt
[none]	[04:19]	<dauoalagio2>	msand, no gui - x won't start,
[none]	[04:19]	<cornell>	Know any problems with Edgy or Fiesty for 64bit?
[none]	[04:19]	<locke1689>	still cant get it fixed, just running in .10
[none]	[04:19]	<lbci_irc>	tda9887.ko is missing on my machine after update... has it been moved/obseleted/forgotten?
[none]	[04:19]	<msand>	ah, okay.  Well, you can use samba for it.
[none]	[04:19]	<jimmygoon>	HEY! FEISTY ROCKS! THANKS!
[positive]	[04:19]	<delmorep>	Jordan_U: awesome, just like when a Quake3 server is full... i mean, an OpenArena server ;)
[none]	[04:19]	<Crav>	how do i upgrade from dapper to fiesty without needing to download the cd image?
[none]	[04:19]	<sky_shark>	does anyone know what i should do to get ubuntu fiesty to write to my windows partion?
[none]	[04:19]	<umop>	jimmygoon, What's so good about it?
[none]	[04:19]	<msand>	I only ever share with windows.. but you don't need to include a windows box on the network for it to work
[none]	[04:20]	<locke1689>	Crav: apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[04:20]	<Kix>	<sky_shark: what file system?

[none]	[04:20]	<Kix>	sky_shark: ntfs writting is unstable... you can safely read / write to fat partitions
[none]	[04:20]	<Crav>	cornell: thanks
[none]	[04:20]	<jimmygoon>	umop, its faster, it detects my memory card reader (built in) and it looks (Better , at leasT)
[none]	[04:20]	<Crav>	Jordan_U_: thanks
[none]	[04:20]	<boss>	Is performance the only downside to using software RAID?
[none]	[04:21]	<boss>	As opposed to hardware RAID...
[none]	[04:21]	<blazemonger>	how do i prevent ubuntu from crashing when i run the molecule screensaver
[none]	[04:21]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
[none]	[04:21]	<boss>	And I suppose not being able to use anything besides RAID 0[+1]  or RAID1[+0] 
[none]	[04:21]	<Jordan_U_>	boss, No, poor support under Linux also
[none]	[04:21]	<umop>	jimmygoon, sounds good! glad it works for you
[none]	[04:21]	<Impaque>	boss: well, with multi-threading CPUs of modern times, the overhead is just a few percent..
[none]	[04:21]	<cotton>	Doesn't ubuntu already come with LAMP installed?
[none]	[04:21]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: samba's pretty easy to configure through the command line
[positive]	[04:21]	<locke1689>	msand: depends :)
[none]	[04:21]	<Impaque>	boss: with software raid, you can use any combo i believe
[none]	[04:22]	<wastrel>	why not just tar and scp
[none]	[04:22]	<boricua>	!LAMP
[negative]	[04:22]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[none]	[04:22]	<boss>	I guess cost as well then.
[none]	[04:22]	<dager>	blazemonger: if its a 3d screensaver, make sure you have the correct video drivers
[none]	[04:22]	<boss>	So basically nowadays, what reasons are there to use hardware RAID?
[none]	[04:22]	<msand>	Well, for basic sharing it is.  I use it on a lan, so I don't worry too much about security.  Just basic username/password check.  No complaints
[none]	[04:22]	<jimmygoon>	Speaking of dealing with feisty, my friend is an idiot and installed a nasty deb that now won't remove because its in a very bad inconsistent state... thats a quote... any ideas?
[none]	[04:23]	<Kazol>	I am trying to choose a theme for Ubuntu. What types are compatible with Ubuntu? Is it GDM, Icon, or XMMS?
[positive]	[04:23]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: how to anywhere?
[none]	[04:23]	<locke1689>	boss: well, youre not reliant on a specific operating system or piece of software
[none]	[04:23]	<Doughy>	I am having a problem re-logging into gnome.  If I try to log into an already-logged-in acocunt, my graphics go out.  My screen flickers white/brown... ideas?
[none]	[04:23]	<umop>	jimmygoon, tell him to apt-get remove packagname
[none]	[04:23]	<eric>	boss: Saving CPU time and PCI bus bandwidth.
[positive]	[04:23]	<Impaque>	boss: well, for some really intensive CPU loads and simultaneous writes, hardware raid is the way to go. but for a general file server, no need to go hardware IMHO. i had some bad experiences with Promise controllers, i go software from then on
[none]	[04:23]	<blazemonger>	dager: i have a high quality rage 128 card though
[none]	[04:23]	<blazemonger>	and it runs every other 3d screensaver
[none]	[04:23]	<xtknight>	boss, swraid is faster in lots of cases
[none]	[04:23]	<boss>	Gotcha.
[none]	[04:23]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, What .deb? if it truly won't remove then you probably need to edit whatever script is failing
[none]	[04:23]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: Depends on what you are trying to theme. You theming xmms? GDM? Window manager? other?
[none]	[04:24]	<boss>	xtknight: Seriously?
[none]	[04:24]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: plenty.  I'm looking for the one I used when I first set it up.
[none]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, in many cases yea
[none]	[04:24]	<dager>	blazemonger: ah, well sometimes the problem can be you don't have the drivers installed correctly.. perhaps its a coding problem specific to that screensaver
[positive]	[04:24]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: thanks
[none]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, hardware raid is cross platform in some cases (if Win2k has a driver and linux has a driver for your card).  not sure that you can mount linux mdadm under win2k, for example
[none]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, but software RAID is much easier to manage.  no hardware needed so you can move it amongst PCs
[none]	[04:25]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, its some bcm43xx-firmware hacked together package he found (he should have waited for me to use ndiswrapper)
[none]	[04:25]	<cabajgtr_>	Is there an easy way to rebuild /dev ?
[none]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	hey guys need some help
[none]	[04:25]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
[negative]	[04:25]	<Kazol>	ardchoille: I am trying to theme the whole gui of everything, including the title bars. Something like this: http://overclockix.octeams.com/snapshot10.jpg
[none]	[04:25]	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question
[none]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	my video in play mode is not full screen any more
[none]	[04:25]	<yell0w>	!defunct
[none]	[04:25]	<xtknight>	boss,  not to mention the raid on which your HD is based is a wide open standard, not some proprietary hole in the wall hardware chipset
[negative]	[04:25]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about defunct - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[none]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: but on other hand, consider this: if you go hardware, and your RAID card dies, you must get exactly the SAME model.. unfortunately, they tend to die after few years = they are hard to find..
[none]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	i use xine as a player
[none]	[04:25]	<xtknight>	Impaque, yeah that's exactly why im using SWRAID right now...forget HW raid
[none]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: with software, you can migrate to different IDE/SATA cards
[none]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: yeah, it rocks.
[none]	[04:25]	<boricua>	yellow: use kill -9 pid to remove defunct process
[none]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	when i play video it is at the bottom of the screen
[none]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	Well
[none]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	Try not to use -9 unless a standard kill pid doesn't terminate it.
[none]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	-9 is a little overkill for MOST processes.
[none]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	or is  over lapped video
[positive]	[04:26]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, I disagree about using NDIS wrapper :) But in what way won't it remove ( and BTW there is an official broadcom firmware package in the Ubuntu repos )
[none]	[04:26]	<umop>	amicrawler, You can't drag it up?
[none]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	The stubborn ones that don't end otherwise, fire the -9 away.
[none]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	nope
[none]	[04:26]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That's going to take several themes. I see: xmms theme, window manager theme, gtk2 theme, icon theme, etc. Besides, that picture looks like he's using kde.
[none]	[04:26]	<boricua>	or from command like killall apps
[none]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	when in full screen
[none]	[04:26]	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question in on line other wise noone will be able to keep track of it
[none]	[04:26]	<xtknight>	swraid is soo awesome
[none]	[04:26]	<Kix>	amicrawler: what output driver are you using?
[none]	[04:26]	<stalkerguypc>	oh where is beryl effect channel

[none]	[04:27]	<boricua>	cotton: use synaptic
[none]	[04:27]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That would be the window manager, the default wm in gnome is metacity.

[none]	[04:27]	<cabajgtr>	no one knows how to rebuild /dev ?
[none]	[04:27]	<DeadCowBoy>	Did Canonical think about new and faster servers since the release of feisty?
[none]	[04:27]	<vadvad>	hi dager! i wanna make my windows work along with linux, how?
[none]	[04:27]	<amicrawler>	kix  what do you think

[none]	[04:28]	<amicrawler>	like gdm or kdm ?
[none]	[04:28]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Can you pastebin the output of: sudo dpkg -r whatever.deb

[none]	[04:28]	<vadvad>	yap

[none]	[04:29]	<huXfluX>	Hello all! Has anyone heard of such a problem? I've just installed festy fawn on a toshiba laptop and the sound volume is very low. I'm playing an mp3 and i can bearly hear it. The volumes are at max (volume control in gnome and alsamixer in CLI). The sound card is a Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02). What to do?
[none]	[04:29]	<behdad>	towsonu: i dont know what is the command from terminal to get howmuch is my free space !

[none]	[04:30]	<zeroday>	huXfluX: go to ubuntuforums and search toshiba sound fix
[none]	[04:30]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop i've been struggling to get my apt-get to download programs since the release... tonight it's working but is incredibly slow
[none]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	intel needs to release drivers for distros other than redhat or suse
[none]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	i dont have anything against suse or anything
[none]	[04:30]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, I tried that method and it didn't work out so hawt with his card (its a stupid one)
[none]	[04:30]	<Kix>	amicrawler: have you played with the video settings? you should be able to choose which driver you want to use for output?
[none]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	i just prefer a *nix based environment
[none]	[04:30]	<xtknight>	no program can tell any difference between a block device of /dev/sdaX and /dev/mdX, is that correct?  /dev/mdX acts EXACTLY as a hd device?  wiping it with zeros will write 0s to the logical partition, it wont destroy the raid array?
[none]	[04:30]	<burner>	stelios: use gparted on teh livecd
[none]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	Impaque: where?
[none]	[04:30]	<Kix>	amicrawler: in xine player
[none]	[04:30]	<behdad>	got it shaba thanks
[none]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	blazemonger: what did you do?
[none]	[04:30]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: That's right.
[none]	[04:30]	<Ax4>	stelios, the recovery partition should still be accessible before you boot an OS
[none]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	zeroday: thanx
[none]	[04:30]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Did you try it with Feisty?
[none]	[04:30]	<cotton>	cabajgtr: Do I need to shutdown Apache before installing it?
[none]	[04:30]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, an option is to download the alternate cd and upgrade from it, I think the mirrors will be slow for a while yet.
[none]	[04:30]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: Things like hdparm will act differently, but they're very special and not commonly used.
[positive]	[04:30]	<behdad>	:))) Available space : 0 , thanku all
[negative]	[04:31]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop already too late for that :(
[none]	[04:31]	<burner>	anyone know if there's  an #ubuntu channel for server related stuff?

[none]	[04:31]	<Ax4>	stelios, it's the entire point of having it there in cases stuff gets messed up, i personally would leave that space alone and not over write it, instead partition the other remaining partition into two pieces
[none]	[04:31]	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, yeah
[none]	[04:31]	<Impaque>	huXfluX: on your laptop.. on my toshiba, i have a volume knob
[none]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	ah
[none]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	yes, of course
[none]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	it's at max
[none]	[04:31]	<jube>	I want to create some short videos (just youtube length / style). Can anyone recommend a simple movie studio program I can install on ubuntu?
[none]	[04:31]	<Fujitsu>	jube: Try Kino.
[none]	[04:31]	<Ax4>	stelios, as burner said, use gparted
[none]	[04:31]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, I don't think it is.. Maybe a slight chance of a package breaking, but they shouldn't and you can always recover them.
[positive]	[04:31]	<stelios>	Ax4: i know but it's not working anymore :)
[none]	[04:31]	<blazemonger>	huXfluX: in windows the drivers are these soundmax 4 program

[none]	[04:32]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, oh ok, well you can still potentially grab an ISO and do a clean install then, depends if you think it will save time.
[none]	[04:33]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: hdparm. It works fine on LVM, so should on md.
[none]	[04:33]	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, ya it only tests reads

[none]	[04:34]	<pandimus>	Hello all
[none]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	i like xfs for handling huge files
[none]	[04:34]	<cire_>	i added that resolution the xorg.conf file but no luck
[none]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	ext3 is probably the most reliable

[none]	[04:34]	<vadvad>	what is swap?
[none]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	xfs has a defratg util
[none]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	vadvad, it is the page file or partition
[positive]	[04:34]	<Jordan_U>	jimmygoon, probably a good idea, I can't think of what that package could have been trying to do, it should be very simple, but if whoever made it didn't know that such a thing already existed they probably can't be trusted to greatly :)
[positive]	[04:34]	<Impaque>	vadvad: xfs is the best bang for the buck.
[none]	[04:34]	<Impaque>	but..
[none]	[04:34]	<Ax4>	stelios, if you over wrote the recovery partition, it's gone and you'll have to contact your computer manufacturer / distributor for recovery CDs, you can still install ubuntu on any remaining partitions if you are currently without an operating system though

[none]	[04:43]	<msand>	locke1689: why do you say that?  I haven't had any problems with it, but I haven't used it all that long.  I've used azureus and it was never as fast as ktorrent is.

[none]	[04:43]	<LM1>	yes it does show it in lspic

[none]	[04:47]	<msand>	locke1689: Interesting about it being slower.  Though I admit, it's entirely possible I've never tried azureus on linux, just the Win version.. and Windows has never had download speeds that I get on linux in any application.

[none]	[05:10]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, well that seems up in the air, i did both an upgrade from edgy to feisty then a complet clen install of feisty, and although if yu upgrade you will have to reinstall the nvidia driver becuse it is a different kernel
[none]	[05:10]	<Drk_Guy>	But the instructions that page gives me are totally confusing
[positive]	[05:10]	<zak_>	NBrepresent, trace bitmap? if you mean trace a bitmap [ie vectorise it] , inkscape will... but if you mean something else, it's probably not in my brain :)
[none]	[05:10]	<lotacus>	guys. does BloGTK support spaces.live.com?
[none]	[05:10]	<lotacus>	or anyone know an app that will?

[none]	[05:12]	<msand>	rrittenhouse: I'm guessing no one's had that problem.  I didn't, personally, so it's hard to give help.  Maybe if you gave details about your drives?
[none]	[05:12]	<boss>	linoleum: If you don't mind using KDE tools, KDevelop is nice.

[none]	[05:12]	<SnoopyTwo>	One more thing....     What's the best method to manage ipchains/iptabes... etc... FW stuff ?
[none]	[05:12]	<nomad111>	hey everyone

I have feisty on it now actually but its a messy upgraded version and I just wanted to install a clean install of Fesity.

[positive]	[05:13]	<Alonea>	kbidd: I did already
[positive]	[05:13]	<xtknight>	refefer_, or you could properly logout or reboot but those aren't as fast/fun ;)
[none]	[05:13]	<sabgenton>	so i can close the bash sesion and  the comand keeps running
[positive]	[05:13]	<drumline_>	I can't believe Ubuntu did this to my computer.   It can't see the partition on boot and NTDLR is missing on the XP side of things.

[none]	[05:13]	<Alonea>	I am trying to read this how to page and its all gnome and I wanted to do it on KDE (its beryl)
[positive]	[05:13]	<Kix>	linoleum: I dont believe it's any more difficult? I've used Dev c++ alot? Kdevlop is a bit much... else you could just use good ol' gedit and the CLI :p
[positive]	[05:14]	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: consider using Eclipse with C plugin... it's easier ;)
[none]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, i opened the console, i have typed that stuff in, and it is downloading some stufff
[none]	[05:14]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: i want to just use the restricted device manager in feisty for nvidia drivers, at least until there's a new driver which i *need* in order to get a bug fix (namely when they fix the black windows bug)
[none]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	What now
[none]	[05:14]	<ardchoille>	"sabgenton: You can try putting a ""&"" on the end of the command (command &) but it doesn't always work."
[none]	[05:14]	<refefer_>	"xtknight: I don't think I made myself understandable, but under each subsection for ""screen"" it lists my resolutions for each depth, but doesn't specify which one to use"
[none]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, oh.  it uses the highest by default i believe.
[none]	[05:14]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, oh I see well being that the upgrade will be a new kernerl you will probably still have to reinstall that driver
[none]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	What now???????
[none]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, but you change it with system->prefs->screen resolutions
[none]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, or ctrl alt PLUS and ctrl alt MINUS

[positive]	[05:15]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  could be the specific service config
[positive]	[05:15]	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: anjuta is similar to kdevelop... consider eclipse with c plugin. I use this for my university. There's a good debugger inside, too :)

[none]	[05:22]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: what can't you do?
[none]	[05:22]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: ah ok... I have the solution
[positive]	[05:22]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: install 915resolution package ;)
[none]	[05:22]	<xtknight>	"refefer_, also output of ""xrandr -q""?"

[none]	[05:22]	<wastrel>	?
[none]	[05:23]	<refefer_>	GionnyBoss: troubles with i810 intel driver?
[none]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: this solved the problem for me on my laptop with intel integrated graphic card... there's a bug that doesn't let you use different resolution, untill you install this 915resolution package and configure it
[none]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: yeah
[none]	[05:23]	<kbidd>	wastrel, I just tried localhost, it works, and then from the LAN, and that failed.
[none]	[05:23]	<xtknight>	GionnyBoss, why i810 doesnt let you set the res in xrog ?
[none]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	xtknight: it's not a i810 problem... it's some intel chipset problem
[none]	[05:23]	<Alonea>	"also, how do you add a script to your ""Session Startup Programs"" list in Kubuntu?"
[none]	[05:23]	<xtknight>	!kubuntu

[negative]	[05:24]	<refefer_>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16961/
[positive]	[05:24]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  check hosts.allow and .deny
[none]	[05:24]	<xtknight>	refefer_, well odd.  it must be a bug, maybe you do need the 915resolution thing
[none]	[05:24]	<GionnyBoss>	"xtknight, refefer_ : with my Dell laptop, I had to install this 915resolution. The chipset has got a bug that ""tells"" that he can only display some resolution, while in reality he can display more resolutions than those"

[none]	[05:42]	<GionnyBoss>	"bobesponja: yeah.. .but as I told you, just hit ""enter"" if you don't want to change the current setting"

[none]	[05:42]	<xange>	xtknight: where do i find that?
[none]	[05:42]	<xtknight>	xange, well the force gpu scaling setting is permanent, no xorg mod needed so i guess you're good to go on that front.  i'd still be curious as to why that fixed it.  as i said if frontend/backend are different then somehow you're not using the native
[none]	[05:42]	<xtknight>	xange, same place as force gpu
[none]	[05:43]	<xange>	xtknight: they match the native
[none]	[05:43]	<xtknight>	xange, and if you un-click force gpu they stil, match?
[none]	[05:43]	<xtknight>	still*
[none]	[05:44]	<thebillywayne>	well, I've followed the 915resolution instructions exactly, and I still can't get either 1600x1200 or 1440x900.  any ideas?

[none]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, well that's very odd. oh well, must be a bug
[none]	[05:44]	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, did you try #edubuntu ? people there are more likely to have used it
[none]	[05:44]	<pipegeek>	Hi, folks.  Just had a quick question about a bit of weirdness in the version of gnome that ships with feisty, and I'm wondering if anyone can reproduce it.  The panel trash bin doesn't seem to respond to being full, on a new, clean install.  That is, it doesn't matter whether there's anything in the trash; the bin always appears empty, and so can't be emptied, except by actually opening the trash and emptying it from the resulting nautilus w
[none]	[05:44]	<pipegeek>	indow.  Can anyone confirm this?
[none]	[05:44]	<peeps>	noelferreira, sudo find / -name dvb-ttpci-01.fw
[none]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, oh woops i should be asking you to compare frontend/backend and native, not frontend TO backend
[none]	[05:44]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I've tested edubuntu & ubuntu, the result is the same
[none]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, ideally they should all be the same under force gpu and no force gpu
[none]	[05:44]	<peeps>	noelferreira, or use iname.  the difference is that iname is case insensitive
[positive]	[05:44]	<xange>	xtknight: i dunno, I have a Samsung Syncmaster 930b if that means anything to you :)
[none]	[05:45]	<xtknight>	xange, definitely does..  1280x1024@60Hz would be native for that

[none]	[05:53]	<xtknight>	reubs, HT should be enabled on an smp/SMT or generic kernel
[none]	[05:53]	<blazemonger>	compiz/beryl wont even run with my rage 128
[none]	[05:53]	<concept10>	reubs, hyperthreading is disabled in the ubuntu kernel
[none]	[05:53]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: I don't know what it could be, really. I thought that it was a xorg.conf configuration problem. Unfortunately I don't have other idea... try to say your problem again here and wait for other people's help. Sorry. Good luck!
[none]	[05:54]	<xtknight>	concept10, per what?

[none]	[05:54]	<reubs>	xtknight: so i have to get the generic kernel and it should be good?
[none]	[05:54]	<concept10>	xtknight, per look at the config
[none]	[05:54]	<reubs>	thanks concept10
[none]	[05:54]	<bradyc>	bobesponja: nvidia restricted and only 800x600?

[none]	[05:54]	<xtknight>	concept10, on an smp kernel HT should wrok
[none]	[05:54]	<xtknight>	work**
[none]	[05:54]	<filch>	yell8w: are you trying to reach this from inside the same network?
[none]	[05:55]	<acidtabs>	Can anyone help me install sauerbraten plz
[none]	[05:55]	<bobesponja>	bradyc: I do I have an nvdia but I'm not sure about the rest
[none]	[05:55]	<boss>	This error is very close to what I'm getting but not quite it.
[negative]	[05:55]	<boss>	It's labeled as medium priority: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kickseed/+bug/48311
[none]	[05:55]	<yell8w>	filch, ssh works fine with the 192.168x ips, not the other one
[none]	[05:55]	<concept10>	xtknight, it hasnt been build with ht enabled for at least 1.5 years or more
[none]	[05:55]	<bradyc>	bobesponja: np sorry.
[none]	[05:55]	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure how it is possible to exclude HT ?
[none]	[05:55]	<xtknight>	concept10, whats the config option name?
[negative]	[05:56]	<boss>	medium priority bug confirmed yet not assigned to anyone :\
[none]	[05:56]	<bradyc>	I'm running both cores on an AMD64... not sure about HT though.
[none]	[05:56]	<concept10>	xtknight, i dont know, you have to find it
[none]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	amd64 doesnt have HT
[none]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	concept10, HT is a bios and cpu level thing
[none]	[05:56]	<bradyc>	yes, I know that.
[none]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	concept10, windows 2k can use it without any updates, etc
[none]	[05:56]	<filch>	yell8w: but if you're coming from one of the internal addresses on that subnet, and you're trying to hit the public ip of the router, the router may be doing something weird cuz it sees you coming from within the network, and not as a true external connection
[positive]	[05:56]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: that options looks right. Try to ask here again first... I'm a normal user like you, and I just tried to help... guess there could be more expert people here that can help you
[none]	[05:56]	<acidtabs>	Can anyone help me install sauerbraten plz
[none]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	concept10, HT appears to the OS as a dual CPU config nothing more nothing less
[none]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	thus an smp kernel will work
[none]	[05:57]	<yell8w>	filch, so it's my router's acting up? i mean i'm getting internet and stuff
[none]	[05:57]	<yell8w>	that's how i'm talking to you
[none]	[05:57]	<concept10>	xtknight, it doesnt
[none]	[05:57]	<Cosmo_>	anyone have a link to the 7.04 desktop torrent ?
[none]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	"there are some mentions of needing to type ""ht=on"" at the kernel boot line"
[none]	[05:57]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: it should be so easy using sauerbraten... just extract the archive and launch it, if I remember right
[none]	[05:57]	<xange>	xtknight: ok, send the e-mail out for ya...I'm going to go take advantage of beryl...enjoy your right and thanks again
[none]	[05:58]	<xtknight>	xange, cool

[none]	[05:58]	<jason_>	sup all
[none]	[05:58]	<braveheartlion>	i've just burned a ubuntu iso onto a cd. how can i check whether the burn is perfect?
[none]	[05:58]	<concept10>	xtknight, therefore its not enabled by default
[none]	[05:58]	<xiambax>	does the new release support intel based macs?
[none]	[05:58]	<yell8w>	filch, also, i have an apache running, doesn't see it
[none]	[05:58]	<acidtabs>	i did try to run the game after extracting it but it does not want to start
[none]	[05:58]	<bradyc>	braveheartlion: boot the CD and run the checker util
[none]	[05:58]	<Lgndryh1>	hi.....how is everyone
[none]	[05:58]	<bradyc>	or actually you can open it in windows too IIRC
[none]	[05:58]	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure about feisty though
[positive]	[05:59]	<filch>	yell8w: with port forwarding, if a connection to the external ip is initiated from a private address behind the router/firewall doing the forwarding, it tends not to work, as its expecting the connection to come from outside the network, not initiated from an address on it's private network. to test this you'd want someone on the outside to try to hit the ip on the specified ports
[none]	[05:59]	<phixnay>	I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
[none]	[05:59]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	In Edgy, all I did was post my name and password at the tty prompt and I got into that level,  Feisty isn't letting me in though with that procedure, anyone have an idea of what to do?
[none]	[05:59]	<fizz_>	guys just installed 7.04, no MP3 will play, where can codecs for noatun etc.
[none]	[05:59]	<xtknight>	concept10, it must only be ubuntu that is like that because i have had a P4 cpu and it was detectd SMP just fine under suse, etc
[none]	[05:59]	<filch>	yell8w: i've seen this with firewalls i use at work for various things
[none]	[05:59]	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro
[none]	[05:59]	<jrib>	fizz_: did you try double clicking on an mp3?
[none]	[05:59]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: so it's not a sauerbraten installation problem... can you paste in pastebin the error output you get, please?
[none]	[05:59]	<jrib>	fizz_: (in nautilus)
[none]	[05:59]	<bradyc>	fizz, check out the multimedia forums on the ubuntu site, there is a sticky on that subject.
[none]	[05:59]	<fizz_>	jrd, will do that now
[none]	[05:59]	<fania>	hai
[none]	[05:59]	<yell8w>	filch, pm ?
[none]	[06:00]	<concept10>	xtknight, that maybe the case, but not in ubuntu.  Some people disable HT because in some cases, it may reduce performance.
[none]	[06:00]	<xtknight>	reubs, place ht=on at the boot line to make sure you have hyperthreading
[none]	[06:00]	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro.....I am currently at 6.10
[none]	[06:00]	<acidtabs>	gionnyboss there is no error when i click run it just closes
[none]	[06:00]	<chainer827>	hello....I cannot install software currently on ubuntu....keeps giving me an error....can anyone help me solve this?
[none]	[06:01]	<phixnay>	what software?
[none]	[06:01]	<braveheartlion>	bradyc: thank you very much.
[none]	[06:01]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: open a terminal and try to start it from a terminal. There you should have some error output
[none]	[06:01]	<reubs>	xtknight: yah, i had already done that but i was looking thro the logs and saw it was refusing to see the next one. is it worth compling my own kernel?
[none]	[06:01]	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of the text at the bottom panel??
[none]	[06:01]	<acidtabs>	let me check
[none]	[06:01]	<xtknight>	reubs, hmm maybe.  the kernel must be deliberately disabling HT, to which i'm very surprised
[none]	[06:01]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: cd /path/to/your/sauerbraten/folder     and then:  ./sauerbraten
[none]	[06:02]	<xtknight>	reubs, so i'm not even sure a recompiled kernel would work either.
[none]	[06:02]	<phixnay>	Hey, I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
[none]	[06:02]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: uhm, sorry... ./sauerbraten_unix
[none]	[06:02]	<linoleum_>	ok I 've got a simple question : I search of an IDE. I found Geany, which is new (less than 1 year of development), and I found it on synaptic ... but then I found OpenLDev , and I wanted to install it with synaptic. but I can't find this one. that s strange because it's a 2year and half project, and they finaly reached the 1.0 version . Why can't I find it with synaptic ?
[none]	[06:02]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Does anyone know how to crack open a tty prompt in Feisty?
[none]	[06:02]	<Kazol>	Does anyone here know howto change the color of the text at the bottom table?
[positive]	[06:02]	<Lathiat>	wil_syd: avahi
[none]	[06:02]	<xtknight>	reubs, but give it a try. i swear my P4 HT was SMP when i had one...but i never did try ubuntu linux, only other distros like suse
[none]	[06:02]	<concept10>	xtknight, you shouldnt be surprised.  I told you in some cases HT reduces performance.  Also, HT is not the same as SMP
[none]	[06:02]	<acidtabs>	i click on display and it pop up with something
[none]	[06:02]	<mhykgyver>	hello everyone
[none]	[06:02]	<acidtabs>	i guess these are errors
[none]	[06:03]	<mhykgyver>	ubuntu newbie here
[none]	[06:03]	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: thanks
[positive]	[06:03]	<reubs>	xtknight: thanks alot tho :) i think its disabled by default as the hyperthreading is a security risk
[none]	[06:03]	<chainer827>	I can't access synaptic anymore...or remove and install software on feisty....need some help
[none]	[06:03]	<phixnay>	linoleum_: beats me. try just searching for Open. you can always download a package of it somewhere
[none]	[06:03]	<xtknight>	reubs, ya i guess
[none]	[06:03]	<acidtabs>	its on my desktop
[none]	[06:03]	<Shaba1>	guys
[none]	[06:03]	<Shaba1>	how do I check my sound system

[none]	[06:03]	<phixnay>	chainer827: why not?
[none]	[06:03]	<acidtabs>	how would i do that if its located on my desktop BOss
[none]	[06:03]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: on display? where? you don't have to click anywere. Just open a terminal and try to start the game from there
[none]	[06:03]	<bullgard4>	Using ysm I could send a message to my friend but could not receive one. What prerequisite did I not meet?
[none]	[06:03]	<Alonea>	ok, my adept/apt whatever is messed up. I can do apt-get update and thats it.
[none]	[06:03]	<mhykgyver>	uhmmm i hope u won't mind me asking but how can i install glib in ubuntu?
[none]	[06:03]	<Drk_Guy>	I am still unable of installing Java
[none]	[06:04]	<Shaba1>	all of a sudden I am not getting any audio on dvds or screen cast in xubuntu
[none]	[06:04]	<chainer827>	I installed the Ubuntu Wireless support software, and it basically made it crash
[none]	[06:04]	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of system font?
[none]	[06:04]	<acidtabs>	i tryed to open terminal but it just closes up just like run
[none]	[06:04]	<Alonea>	if I try to install something I get E: Invalid record in the preferences file, no Package header
[none]	[06:04]	<acidtabs>	did
[none]	[06:04]	<phixnay>	chainer827: so what can you do now? can you login?
[none]	[06:04]	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: just noted in Feisty Avahi is S50 and mt-daapd is S20
[none]	[06:04]	<chainer827>	yes....on my computer now....just can't install, upgrade, or uninstall software
[positive]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: do you have 3d drivers installed and configured correctly for your graphic card? and then be sure that you installed SDL :)
[none]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	my grafics are installed whats sdl?
[none]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	and how would i get it
[none]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: sdl library is fundamental to run this game
[none]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	ic
[none]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	"acidtabs: don't remember exactly the name... search in Synaptic for packages like ""SDL"" or ""libsdl"" and install them"

[none]	[06:06]	<newuser>	iam having trouble with usplash ; has anyone had success with installing usplash on kubuntu 7.04
[none]	[06:06]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: a lot of games for linux (sauerbraten included) use sdl libraries
[none]	[06:06]	<chainer827>	yeah...tried those....it gives me an error message saying Dynamic MMap ran out of room
[none]	[06:07]	<phixnay>	chainer827: whoa, I have no idea what that means
[none]	[06:07]	<acidtabs>	with one should i download thats tons of them
[negative]	[06:07]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	I agree that tty is invaluable to editing files in certain cases and it is in Ubuntu so it should work.  :\
[none]	[06:07]	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?

[none]	[06:08]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: go and search on google what a library is
[none]	[06:08]	<EnsignRedshirt>	linoleum_: The openldev download page has an ubuntu .deb file.

[none]	[06:08]	<acidtabs>	ill try to install some and see
[none]	[06:08]	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?

[none]	[06:10]	<peeps>	Shaba1, can you get sound in any programs?
[none]	[06:10]	<phixnay>	shaba1: if you had to manually install kernel modules to get sound to work, you have to install them again each time you upgrade your kernel

[none]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	and that sound was working even after I installed that
[none]	[06:11]	<phixnay>	chainer827: try running top to see if you have anything using up resources, or if there's anything else shifty going on
[none]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	but now it seems not to work
[none]	[06:11]	<MTecknology>	I'm trying to upgrade to 7.04 through the update manager and I get an error

[none]	[06:12]	<bradyc>	Oh?  That's kinda nuts.
[none]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	no i havent changed or moved anything, all i did was update ubuntu
[none]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	i had to change my /etc/fstab file
[none]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	because it wouldnt mount my home directory
[positive]	[06:12]	<bradyc>	wil_syd: is that a bug?
[negative]	[06:12]	<dougb>	"i'm having problems with LAMP, i installed all the proper packages and it all went well, but i heard that I can create ""public_html"" in my home directory and type in ""http://localhost/~username/"" as a web address and it would reroute to the proper folder, but it didn't"
[none]	[06:12]	<mister_roboto>	xjkx: synaptic

[none]	[06:13]	<chowmeined>	how do I edit ogg theora files? I tried opening them with Kino but it fails
[none]	[06:13]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, just a sarcastic remark,  colored system fonts isn't a feature with Ubuntu
[none]	[06:13]	<wil_syd>	bradyc: no.. by design... all moved under the scsi layer like usb drives.
[negative]	[06:13]	<quaal>	ok so if i setup a shared printer with the URI http://192.168.0.7:631/printers/officejet_5500_series and i print a test page, it says Printing 1 jobs and then the job goes away and printer status goes back to ready, everything is working fine on the ubuntu end? I'm not getting any printout
[none]	[06:13]	<bulmer>	dougb you have the correct apache configuration?
[none]	[06:13]	<dougb>	it's all default
[none]	[06:13]	<chainer827>	it has something to do with the package files that synaptic accesses
[none]	[06:13]	<dougb>	the tutorial i went by didn't talk about needing to configure apache
[none]	[06:13]	<peeps>	Kazol, do you mean for the command line, or the fonts in your desktop environment?
[none]	[06:13]	<cesar_>	anyone know why the ubuntu upgrade would just go ahead and change the device names... ?
[none]	[06:13]	<phixnay>	Shaba1: what happens if you click on the volume adjustor in the menu bar
[none]	[06:14]	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: so there is no way to change the color of the text at the bottom panel (that shows the open programs)?
[none]	[06:14]	<mister_roboto>	cesar_: you mean the disk drives?
[none]	[06:14]	<phixnay>	cesar: cause it's using libsata or something now
[none]	[06:14]	<bulmer>	dougb you need to learn a little bit about apache

[none]	[06:23]	<eternaljoy>	paradon: cheers
[none]	[06:23]	<cesar_>	the reason i had to edit my /etc/fstab is because i mounted /home to its own hard drive

[none]	[06:24]	<filch>	that sucks

[none]	[06:24]	<xtknight>	bulmer, ahh different than shared folders?

[none]	[06:24]	<memphis>	has anyone installed/compiled video drivers for Intel 965?
[none]	[06:24]	<xtknight>	bulmer, you can however enable SMB within the guest OS and have it work like any other networked windows PC (enable SMB in Windows firewall)
[none]	[06:25]	<bulmer>	xtknight: yeah, i wanted to run a server in the guest os and access it from a client (from a remote computer)
[none]	[06:25]	<se2131>	xtknight: the /var/crash directory only has a couple of files that were updated a couple of days ago

[negative]	[06:25]	<xtknight>	se2131, ah i suppose youll have to wait if/until it crashes again, unfortunately.  as for next time uhh i'm not sure :\..kinda per-case basis depending on how/what's crashing
[none]	[06:25]	<oldude67>	ok if i have the latest version of java loaded on to this machine why cant i run frostwire?

[none]	[06:26]	<GButler>	After I've installed Feisty on my laptop, after the log-in screen, the desktop hangs. It cuts out of the splash screen early and cuts the log-in sound off early as well. Then, it just leaves the desktop and blank menu bars (sometimes no menu bars at all!). I can't right click, and I don't understand what's going on at all. I can boot up in recovery mode (Which I'm doing now), and when I do...
[none]	[06:26]	<se2131>	xtknight: it worked fine w/ edgy
[none]	[06:26]	<GButler>	...that it tells me that there's an Internal Error and it cannnot initialize HAL...anyone have an idea of what's going on?
[none]	[06:26]	<bulmer>	Tarkus: for one, the .bin file you download have to be chmod u+x  then you need to run update-alternatives java

[none]	[06:32]	<concept10>	xtknight, I know HP was disabling the new Intel virtulization features on the laptop motherboard somehow because alot of people complained about not being able to use those features
[none]	[06:32]	<toastjam>	hey, so is there anyway to get the kernel make install process to create the necessary initrd image as well?
[none]	[06:32]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, I get the login but it doesn't recognise my password
[none]	[06:32]	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: it is installed, you just have to make rules. look into fwbuilder
[none]	[06:32]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: According to google, yes.  Really, stunnel should work with pretty much anything.

[none]	[06:32]	<xtknight>	concept10, lenovo rather
[none]	[06:32]	<Shaddox>	lordhelmet: I'll google it. ^^
[none]	[06:32]	<wil_syd>	rpaul: is that a ghost of you ? Wait till it times out.

[none]	[06:32]	<toastjam>	everything I read online says making and installing the kernel creates initrd, but as far as I can tell it doesn't, and my system won't boot without it
[negative]	[06:32]	<bofh80>	eternaljoy, http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/features.html   how's about that?
[none]	[06:32]	<Shaddox>	lordhelmet: Does it support being used on this machine over SSH?
[none]	[06:32]	<xtknight>	bulmer, weird.  so other PCs on the host's LAN /can't/ access the guest..

[none]	[06:33]	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: probably with xforwarding, but they have windows clients as well so you can create your script anywhere and just scp it over or something
[positive]	[06:33]	<concept10>	"xtknight, I just found this: To achieve the maximum gain from Hyper-Threading requires the 2.6 kernel compiled with the ""-march=pentium4"" option. This is accomplished by setting the processor to ""pentium4"" in the kernel configuration menu. It looks like Hyper-Threading on the Pentium4 with Linux is fact after all."
[none]	[06:33]	<bulmer>	xtknight: yes because the guest is usually on a different subnet
[none]	[06:33]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: configure stunnel to connect to your NNTPS server, and configure Pan with stunnel as it's NNTP server.

[none]	[06:44]	<obble>	stroppytux: i've tried right clicking over the src files to see if theres an add source file or something like that. but there isnt
[none]	[06:44]	<n2diy>	"weltschmerz: check out "" man loadkeys"" and ""system -prefrences-keyboard"""
[none]	[06:44]	<xtknight>	se2131, suppoesdly that laptop is notorious for freezing
[negative]	[06:44]	<xjkx>	Please check what mp3 player came by default :(
[none]	[06:44]	<thebillywayne>	my motherboard came with a disc with Linux shell scripts on it.  Should I run these?
[negative]	[06:44]	<MrTexor>	ok, I'm stupid.. but I cant find the llink for the torrent file :(
[none]	[06:44]	<xtknight>	se2131, again though if it doesn't happen on Edgy or windows/etc... then you can ignore that as that can't be the problem
[positive]	[06:44]	<Madpilot>	Skipzorz, that said, you can run Apache/etc on a standard install too - useful if you want a testing/dev server that isn't exposed to the public
[none]	[06:44]	<bulmer>	thebillywayne: why not see whats in it before running the script?
[none]	[06:45]	<obble>	Alright anyone else know how to fix my Kdevelop problem: I'm just trying to add already made source files to a project. But I cant manage to do it.
[none]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: oh man, so maybe i should talk to toshiba
[none]	[06:45]	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: I would never run a script without looking it over first.
[none]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: I should also clarify the type of crash i'm having
[none]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, why dont you just try Edgy for the night , like right now, and see if it hapepns
[none]	[06:45]	<Zues_62>	does anyone know of a lit file reader for ubuntu?
[none]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, hmm yeah what do you mean by crash then?
[none]	[06:45]	<fernando>	hello
[none]	[06:45]	<Skipzorz>	well, I already have an apache server set up on windows, and am converting it to ubuntu server
[none]	[06:45]	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, bulmer, looking at it, though I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
[none]	[06:45]	<Shaezsche>	"what does the ""dbe"" module in xorg do? what is double buffering"
[none]	[06:45]	<root__>	how do you scroll up bash?
[none]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: the mouse is still responsive
[none]	[06:45]	<Shaezsche>	if i want more fps should i load it or not
[none]	[06:45]	<Skipzorz>	windows is attacked to much
[none]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, oh..
[none]	[06:45]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: so, in linux when it installs, it only puts stuff in the directory i specified? or does it still scatter stuff arround in the system that will take many hours to find them?
[none]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: but I can't do anything with the applciations
[none]	[06:45]	<Madpilot>	MrTexor, look for the .torrent files at the same places you download the rest of the Ubuntu ISOs
[none]	[06:45]	<obble>	Can someone pretty please help me with a Kdevelop issue?
[positive]	[06:46]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, why is it the linux community say server and they mean 'web' server, why is that? not File server or Backup Server or Application server, like business wise, why is that? lol it drives me potty :P
[none]	[06:46]	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: Yeah, that can be a drawback. I wold recommend learning bash scripting at some point.
[none]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, it could be I/O overload, perhaps from updatedb trying to update the search database.
[none]	[06:46]	<se2131>	xtknight: i can't do ctrl-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-del, or ctrl-alt-f1
[none]	[06:46]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i know where the keyboard preferences are.  i'm talking about the XKB file where you define the keymaps.
[none]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, try alt SysRq K next time
[none]	[06:46]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, what does that do?
[none]	[06:46]	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, yeah.  that's it.
[none]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, kills all open apps, it's a last resort/kernel debug
[none]	[06:46]	<lordhelmet>	gah why does this install fail all the time?? stupid translation files...
[none]	[06:46]	<NemesisD>	can you guys help me fix ubuntu? attempting to upgrade seems to have just about destroyed my ubuntu partition
[none]	[06:46]	<peeps>	"anyone know what ""dos2unix"" is?  i think i need this program"
[none]	[06:46]	<root__>	how do you scroll bash?
[none]	[06:46]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	thanks bulmer,
[none]	[06:46]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy for instance:     key <AE06> { [          6,  asciicircum, dead_circumflex, dead_circumflex ]  };
[none]	[06:46]	<Madpilot>	bofh80, not sure - because most of the time when people say 'server' they mean 'web server', probably. People who want advice on a file server will generally be more specific than just 'server'
[none]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
[none]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, if your mouse moves, alt sysrq K will unfreeze your PC.  not that you shold be using that regularly.  in fact you should never use it ideally but it's not like it's harmful
[none]	[06:47]	<bulmer>	Tarkus it puts stuff in what is considered normal directories like /etc for the configs  or /usr/local/ ..read the package you are installing and find out as much..but for java its not that awkward
[none]	[06:47]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, ahh i see, that makes sense, LOL.
[none]	[06:47]	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: roger, then check out the man page for loadkeys
[none]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: i guess anything in a pinch
[none]	[06:47]	<Moosejaw>	is it possible that feisty is effecting my wireless NICS range with my router?
[none]	[06:47]	<Skipzorz>	is LAMP the best way to go for servers?
[none]	[06:47]	<zak_>	peeps: changes DOS text format into a unix text format [fixes newline glitches...]  it can be done with standard commands though, someone should be able to fill you in
[none]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, but if the mouse is moving that means your kernel is still running
[none]	[06:47]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, thanks for clearing that up, another n00b problem.  heheheheheh
[none]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, meaning you could alt sysrq K , goto a virtual terminal, and check dmesg or save it to a file and post it
[none]	[06:47]	<bulmer>	Skipzorz: what do you want to serve?
[none]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: is there a way to limit the rate of  I/O
[none]	[06:48]	<xtknight>	se2131, almost /certainly/ dmesg will have useful info in it
[none]	[06:48]	<oldude67>	trying to get frostwire to run but keeps coming up with no java installed and have the newest when i type in the command to apt-get

[none]	[06:48]	<GButler>	Does any one here know why, on a laptop, I'd get an Internal Error that says Ubuntu cannot initialize the HAL when I boot up in recovery mode, and when I try to boot into the normal mode it just hangs, cuts the splash screen off and just loads a wallpaper?
[none]	[06:48]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: java is installing now though add/remove. it started working. is that a good way to do it?
[none]	[06:48]	<xtknight>	se2131, not that i know of.
[none]	[06:48]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
[none]	[06:48]	<peeps>	zak_, do you know what package i need to install?  I need to compile something from source and the makefile is failing because of this

[none]	[06:52]	<bofh80>	sam__, you can use ftp to access all the files on your system . . .
[none]	[06:52]	<weltschmerz>	the xkb system is just chaos.
[none]	[06:52]	<Death_Sargent>	gnome and kde won't work
[none]	[06:52]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i fixed it using my own advice, using a much older xkb file.

[none]	[06:54]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: nice
[none]	[06:54]	<paradon>	sam__: and you'll want to edit /etc/vsftpd.conf, by default it only has anonymous access enabled.
[none]	[06:54]	<bulmer>	"Moosejaw: im still not sure i comprehend ""less range"" as in your nic is not able to listen to an AP ?"
[none]	[06:55]	<scotty_>	Alright, I have a question regarding feisty install.
[none]	[06:55]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: the signal strength isnt as strong as it was
[none]	[06:55]	<sanityx>	I had to reinstall windows after I installed ubuntu. To resture grub I can just boot off the feisty cd right
[none]	[06:55]	<xtknight>	Moosejaw,  it's possible the driver is more picky about the wireless range somehow.  usually that's a wireless/RF chipset tolerance not a driver one though who knows.
[none]	[06:55]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: ttySX is a serial port
[none]	[06:55]	<sanityx>	whats the command again, grub-install?
[none]	[06:56]	<Moosejaw>	xtknight thanks
[none]	[06:56]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: where do I put that?

[none]	[06:56]	<diabolix>	anyone here use deskbar?
[none]	[06:56]	<xtknight>	no commands tabcomplete but filenames do when using 'sudo'
[none]	[06:56]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: maybe the drivers used are not using the same capabilities..besides anything wireless is not guaranteed to work 100%
[negative]	[06:56]	<|ringo|>	sanityx: next time you install windows after linux, do this before installing windows: dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 > /tmp/backup/MBR.bin
[none]	[06:56]	<Shaba1>	I have no dies what it is diabolix
[none]	[06:56]	<|ringo|>	that backs up the master book record, so you can restore it after windows deletes it
[none]	[06:56]	<sanityx>	heh ok
[none]	[06:56]	<oldude67>	why is it i cant get frostwire to see the new java installed?
[none]	[06:57]	<sanityx>	|ringo|: yeah but then the mbr wont have a windows listing
[none]	[06:57]	<Shaba1>	But am interested in findign out
[positive]	[06:57]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: it was working great in edgy with the same drivers...so i sorta expected the same in feisty
[none]	[06:57]	<diabolix>	xtknight, thats because bash searches you're path for the command to run, but only searches the working directory for arguments.
[none]	[06:57]	<|ringo|>	sanityx: right but then you run uh...  grub-install and it will find windows and add it to the grub list
[none]	[06:57]	<bofh80>	xtknight, works for me
[none]	[06:57]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Just set both boxes up to us the same ttySX, baud rates, etc... It is a simple serial port connection.
[none]	[06:57]	<sanityx>	|ringo|: ah ok
[none]	[06:57]	<diabolix>	i seem to remember that working in edgy tho...
[none]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	diabolix, ah hmm.  bash does have some features i'd deem far more advanced such as argument tab completing so i wondered
[none]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	bofh80, interesting
[none]	[06:58]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: but just because I can talk to the port doesn't mean it will give me a login prompt
[none]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	bofh80, you can type sudo grub-i and it will say grub-install?
[none]	[06:58]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: again, umm nothing is guaranteed..and how do you really measure this percieved slowness?
[none]	[06:58]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ah, I see. Look into ssh
[none]	[06:58]	<bofh80>	xtknight, yup, works...

[none]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	diabolix, it's in the preferences isnt it..

[none]	[06:59]	<scotty_>	"I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the ""install"" button at the end of the process.

[none]	[07:00]	<bulmer>	xtknight: try tput reset  and see if it resets to some default working terminal
[none]	[07:00]	<scotty_>	anyone?
[none]	[07:00]	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: Under background, you can set the opacity
[none]	[07:01]	<xtknight>	Andruk, but what has happened up until this point?  metacity should be starting
[none]	[07:01]	<xtknight>	Andruk, gnome should 'just work' (tm)
[none]	[07:01]	<Andruk>	i upgraded to feisty...
[none]	[07:01]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, i know how to do that, but im using a theme, which has a bckground
[none]	[07:01]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, if you use a backround you cant set opacity, theres another way
[none]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	bulmer, it cleared my screen basically
[positive]	[07:02]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, then your right, I don't have a clue! :) Are the other boxes playing with winders?
[none]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	bulmer, hrm what does that do?
[none]	[07:02]	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: I have mine set to white with the opacity at around 30%
[none]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	"bulmer, different than ""clear""?"
[none]	[07:02]	<Andruk>	xtknight: well, i can start metacity from the terminal, and when i hit ctrl+c it exits, then automatically restarts metacity.  but if i just log in and leave gnome alone, metacity does not load
[none]	[07:02]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: well, I have samba and some win boxes too
[none]	[07:02]	<bofh80>	hmm, i don't get it, how come no one is raving about their cool 3d desktops ? ;p
[none]	[07:02]	<bulmer>	xtknight: tput is basically for terminal setting
[none]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	Andruk, weird.  hmm look in ~/.xinitrc maybe
[none]	[07:03]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, I only am playing with Ubuntu to Ubuntu.
[none]	[07:03]	<bulmer>	xtknight: it has options i cant remember though
[none]	[07:03]	<Ademan>	how might one import emails from a previous installation of ubuntu into a new one? (evolution)
[none]	[07:03]	<xtknight>	Ademan, maybe access the ~/.evolution folder of the old ubuntu
[none]	[07:03]	<xtknight>	Ademan, i thought feisty's installer also had profile importing you could do
[none]	[07:03]	<Ademan>	xtknight: it very well may
[none]	[07:03]	<eoX>	Hi is it true that if i install linux first then windows will not install b/c it will not recongnize the linux partitions?
[none]	[07:03]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: thats all I am trying to do right now.   login from ubuntu1 to u2 via the serial cable and null modem
[none]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	Ademan, only in the livecd installer though not Alternate or Update-manager->feisty
[none]	[07:04]	<bofh80>	Ademan, if you know where the data is, surely evolution has it's own import process?
[positive]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	Ademan, not 100% sure so backup ~/.evolution or export from within the app?
[none]	[07:04]	<Gumby>	eoX: you cant install windows on a linux partition.
[none]	[07:04]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, so what is wrong with ssh then?
[none]	[07:04]	<scott1>	"I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the ""install"" button at the end of the process. Now there's just an item in my taskbar called ""Installing system."" When clicked, it brings a window to focus. However, the window is tiny and just has a little gray box in it. Is that normal?"
[none]	[07:04]	<Ademan>	eoX: no windows will install, but it will overwrite GRUB and you'll hafta do extra work to get to your linux partition, linux will autodetect your windows partition and everything will be easier
[none]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	actually sometimes windows wont even install
[none]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	because it's so picky
[none]	[07:04]	<bulmer>	CarlFK: is the a getty process running on those serial ports?
[negative]	[07:04]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, look at this preview http://gnomelook.org/content/preview.php?preview=1&id=53883&file1=53883-1.jpg&file2=&file3=&name=Fedora+Gnome+Vista+Panel
[none]	[07:05]	<Ademan>	xtknight: well i'm backing up my entire home directory so you know, whatever, hopefully it will work
[none]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	itll say unrecognized boot partition because GRUB is there
[none]	[07:05]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: ssh goes over ip -
[none]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	and wont install
[negative]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	ive had that :(
[none]	[07:05]	<bofh80>	Ademan, i looked at the evolution import option, bit lacking isn't it lol
[none]	[07:05]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: i think i have things working better now...thanks for your help.
[none]	[07:05]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: du no.  the one I am trying to connect 'to' is running a fresh feisty
[none]	[07:05]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: no problem, sometimes pointing out that there are no guarantees, people realize some stuff are acceptable afterall
[none]	[07:06]	<Ademan>	bofh80: haha, yeah, i guess i'll just keep .evolution around in case i ever need to find an old email, and other than that, i'll just start fresh
[none]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: on a separate note, my upload speed is now equivalent to my download speed...which makes no sense.  how can i improve my download speed?
[none]	[07:06]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: OK! Now who doesn't have a clue?! IP is serial comms!
[none]	[07:06]	<eoX>	ademan for me i did windows install and its ok but when i installed linux first then windows will hang at examining hardwares and give a black screen before even going into the blue agreement screen
[none]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	my upspeed is 1301/kbs and my dload is 1000/lbs
[none]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	kbs
[positive]	[07:06]	<bofh80>	Ademan, i had high hopes for evolution, it has a few nice tricks up it sleeve, but it's pants :)
[none]	[07:06]	<Ademan>	eoX: interesting, i personally have done both, and both worked, just windows second took a lot more work
[none]	[07:06]	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
[none]	[07:07]	<axisys>	does ubuntu works with cisco leap?
[none]	[07:07]	<Ademan>	lol bofh80
[positive]	[07:07]	<tankcat>	i just order a machine with an amd64 dualcore cpu for $310 :-)
[none]	[07:07]	<Andruk>	xtknight: i dont have an ~/.xinitrc (and yes, i am looking at hidden files).  i do have an ~/.xsession-errors though, would you like to see that?
[none]	[07:07]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: yean, but first I would have to bring up a ip over serial connection, which would get screwed the same way my eth0 connection is getting screwed
[none]	[07:07]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: the site your downloading from have to be capable of doing same too or higher speed than yours..lots of factors..isp maybe have you throttled
[none]	[07:07]	<renato>	everyone happy with Feisty?
[none]	[07:07]	<xtknight>	Andruk, sure that may be helpful
[positive]	[07:07]	<liz>	yes yes :)
[none]	[07:07]	<eoX>	ademan did you use mkfs.vfat and fdisk to make a parition first in linux? or use gpart to parition the empty space first before you install windows to it?
[negative]	[07:07]	<xtknight>	Ademan, http://email.about.com/cs/evolutiontips/qt/et110103.htm
[none]	[07:07]	<Moosejaw>	hrm...my dload speed should be 6000kbs...just unusual
[none]	[07:07]	<Phineas>	renato, it's fantastic. Brought me back from the darkside
[none]	[07:07]	<liquiddoom>	Feisty rocks. I have a couple errors every now and then, but oh well.
[none]	[07:08]	<tom_>	PPPPPPPPPPPPPPLEEEEEASE I have honestly been working on this for over 8 hours... I just want to change my screen resolution

[none]	[07:08]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: getty's used to be setup in /etc/initab, but that went away a few versions ago
[none]	[07:08]	<tom_>	xtknight, do you know how to help me... I have gone through all that before and had to reinstall feisty 4 times
[none]	[07:08]	<_3uG_>	quick question.. what's the difference between linux-image-###-386 and linux-image-###-generic?
[none]	[07:08]	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
[none]	[07:08]	<liz>	tom: whats not working right?
[none]	[07:09]	<Ademan>	eoX: i used the partitioner included with the ubuntu installer, which at the time was gparted
[none]	[07:09]	<bulmer>	CarlFK: on a dapper am using now, its still is enabled
[none]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, what video adapter do you have?

[none]	[07:09]	<tom_>	xtknight, video adapter?
[none]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, i wont say i WILL be able to fix your resolution problem but i very likely will be able to
[none]	[07:09]	<tom_>	xtknight, you mean my video card?
[positive]	[07:09]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: huh - maybe Ill just give it a shot :)
[none]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, yes or onboard video chip, whichever applies
[none]	[07:09]	<eoX>	ademan yeah i did the same but windows installer hangs with linux present its not a big deal i just wanted to know so thanks
[none]	[07:09]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: you can not really complain of not getting same speed upload or download unless your ISP guarantees it..which most likely they wont
[none]	[07:09]	<liz>	tom: define looks right, what does it look like

[none]	[07:11]	<xtknight>	tom_, okay have you tried installing the nvidia drives?
[none]	[07:11]	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thanks
[none]	[07:11]	<liz>	tom: kk yor using an nvidia 6600 have you downloaded the drivers yets from nvidia (the stock open source nv driver constantly freezes on me)_
[none]	[07:11]	<tom_>	xtknight, I installed the restricted drivers from the option
[none]	[07:11]	<xtknight>	yeah stock nv is awful
[none]	[07:11]	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, i dont see that under preferences anymore in feisty..
[none]	[07:11]	<blanky>	!ati
[negative]	[07:11]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[negative]	[07:11]	<liquiddoom>	Moosejaw: http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest
[none]	[07:11]	<xtknight>	"tom_, ah okay.  type ""glxinfo | grep rendering"" to verify that they are being used"
[none]	[07:12]	<ardchoille>	I was a bit aprehensive of leaving Dapper for Feisty since Dapper has been super stable, but Feisty has proven very nice thus far. The Ubuntu devs did a good job on Feisty.
[none]	[07:12]	<kkathman>	could someone help me regarding problems with sound?  For some reason, the system seems to be trying to use the onboard instead of my SB live, even when I have it set properly
[none]	[07:12]	<Ademan>	eoX: hehe, well sorry, good luck with all that
[none]	[07:12]	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: Nor do I. Odd.
[none]	[07:12]	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thats what i have used, and need to change my MTU according to the tweak tester
[none]	[07:12]	<tom_>	xtknight, it said yes
[none]	[07:12]	<xtknight>	"tom_, also ""lsmod | grep nvidia"" to verify that the 'nvidia' driver is loaded.  if 'nvidia' is shown you're fine."
[none]	[07:12]	<tom_>	liz_,  i don't know
[none]	[07:12]	<liquiddoom>	Moosejaw: Ah. I only know how to change my WRT54G running DD-WRT
[none]	[07:12]	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, did that run something i could run in a term?
[none]	[07:13]	<_3uG_>	i'm trying to get my nvidia drivers to work too, but the restricted drivers manager installs the old 7xxx kernel driver and the newer 9xxx glx file.. which doesn't make sense.
[none]	[07:13]	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: I don't know, I'll check
[none]	[07:13]	<tom_>	xtknight, nvidia was shown
[none]	[07:13]	<blanky>	guys how do we install ati drivers, in the ati wiki page it just shows instructions for edgy and dapper, do we use edgy instructions?
[none]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	"tom_, type ""sudo nvidia-settings"".  look at the settings in there.  you should be able to change your resolution."
[none]	[07:13]	<Phineas>	blanky: what ati card are you using?
[none]	[07:13]	<bofh80>	xtknight, should he be using nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new ? i think the latter? will the restricted manager have installed the correct one?
[none]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800, no, I don't want the open source drivers
[none]	[07:13]	<RushCreek>	Hey, my roomate changed my root password, i cant get into init 1 to change it, is there anyway to resolve this?
[none]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	bofh80, restricted seems to always install -glx i think.  im not sure honesly
[none]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800 pro
[none]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	bofh80, good point though
[none]	[07:13]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: Shouldn't that be gksudo nvidia-settings?
[none]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, ??
[none]	[07:14]	<RushCreek>	use the readon driver blanky it works with AIGLX
[none]	[07:14]	<tom_>	xtknight, you are a god
[none]	[07:14]	<tom_>	w00t
[none]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, perhaps im not sure
[none]	[07:14]	<blanky>	RushCreek, yeah thanks but how do you install it
[none]	[07:14]	<bofh80>	lol
[none]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	"tom_, if the resolution succeeds you press the button that says ""save to X configuration"""
[none]	[07:14]	<ardchoille>	!gksudo
[none]	[07:14]	<ubotu>	If you need to run graphical applications as root, use  gksudo , as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using  sudo <GUI-application> 
[none]	[07:14]	<tom_>	xtknight, 9 damn hours of work and you fixed it in 2 seconds
[none]	[07:14]	<blanky>	wait though the radeon driver is the open source one isn't it
[none]	[07:14]	<RushCreek>	blanky:  what version of ubuntu? it comes with edgy for a fact, and probobly the rls before
[none]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yes but what about apps that may be wrappers for gtk apps?

[none]	[07:15]	<tom_>	xtknight, will I have any problems if I install beryl?
[none]	[07:15]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: I'm not sure there.
[none]	[07:15]	<RushCreek>	you can install thoes via apt banky
[none]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yeah gksu would be used for nvidia-settings
[none]	[07:15]	<RushCreek>	apt-get install fglrx-module or some such biz
[none]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, what does 'gksu' even do differently anyways?
[none]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	i genreally use it reliously instead of sudo
[none]	[07:15]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: That isn't a static IP, and IP should look like 123.345.567.999
[none]	[07:15]	<crdlb>	blanky, did you try the restricted manager?
[none]	[07:15]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use gksudo for GTK apps
[none]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	tom_, i dont think so
[none]	[07:15]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use sudo sometimes doesn't work right with them
[none]	[07:16]	<RushCreek>	so anyone have any ideas on resetting a root password on a local machine?
[none]	[07:16]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Err.
[none]	[07:16]	<Phineas>	Hey guys, how do I set a keystroke to launch the terminal?

[none]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	liquiddoom, yeah i know.  i'd like as many details as possible as to the differences between gksu and sudo
[none]	[07:16]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: It sets up the environment better than sudo does.
[none]	[07:16]	<crdlb>	blanky, yes
[none]	[07:16]	<blanky>	crdlb, yeah it's there, thanks!
[none]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	ah

[none]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	tom_, did you save the config to X11/xorg.conf?
[none]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	tom_, there is a button in nvidia-settings you must press after appyling the resolution
[none]	[07:16]	<blanky>	man feisty is a huge milestone in desktop linux
[none]	[07:16]	<tom_>	xtknight, .... one problem in the terminal when I clicked save to X configuration file it gave me an Error: FAiled to generate an X config file!
[none]	[07:17]	<Phineas>	Doughy, what's the problem?
[none]	[07:17]	<xtknight>	"tom_, did you run nvidia-settings with ""sudo"" (well it should be ""gksudo"")"

[none]	[07:17]	<xtknight>	Feisty should read the EDID
[none]	[07:17]	<Doughy>	I think it has something to do with beryl or the compiz features in ubuntu 7.04, but not sure
[negative]	[07:18]	<xtknight>	but i heard we will have to wait until Xorg 7.3 for that :\
[none]	[07:18]	<tom_>	xtknight, yes I tried both sudo and gksudo neither allowed me to save the xfile
[none]	[07:18]	<Phineas>	Doughy, did you install beryl?

[none]	[07:18]	<Phineas>	did you rerun the xorg config?
[none]	[07:18]	<bofh80>	xtknight, cos of the rush redevelopment when nvidia rehashed the drivers just prior to release day lol

[none]	[07:20]	<xtknight>	tom_, add the resolution to the bottom (1680x1050)

[none]	[07:20]	<Doughy>	I have no idea
[none]	[07:21]	<Kellster>	Can someone PLEASE help me with wireless on a DV9000 HP laptop.
[none]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, it really should, if you restart your X server.
[none]	[07:21]	<Phineas>	Nemesis: did you check that your password is correct?
[none]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, let's just try now and we will debug as we go
[none]	[07:21]	<tom_>	xtknight, can I add 1400x900 instead?
[negative]	[07:21]	<Phineas>	Doughy: check this link, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto it is a good tutorial about resolution and screen settings
[none]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, yes you can add that but i'd recommend 'also' not 'instead'

[none]	[07:21]	<Phineas>	Kellster, what's the problem?
[positive]	[07:22]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: no, I haven't looked at the image, but if you aren't running DNS,  how do you expect to resolve the ip address? Looking at the image now.

[none]	[07:24]	<xtknight>	tom_, correct
[none]	[07:24]	<Phineas>	Kellster, I'm researching
[none]	[07:24]	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, i dont know, honestly

[none]	[07:24]	<Moosejaw>	no worries thanks
[none]	[07:24]	<tom_>	xtknight, done
[none]	[07:24]	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, i would just ignore the results of that test and instead use a download/upload speed test to see if you are satisfied with the speeds
[none]	[07:24]	<Raiders32>	hello, I'm using Dapper,  where are the kernel header files located?
[none]	[07:24]	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, and as long as your pings dont seem higher than nromal..

[none]	[07:33]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: what is this command going to give me?
[none]	[07:33]	<tom_>	xtknight, like the time/clock/powerbuttong/wirelss got all rearranged
[none]	[07:33]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Sounds like a problem in the bridge config?
[none]	[07:33]	<Diablo69er>	....well I guess not
[none]	[07:33]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, an idea of the first 512 bytes of your partition.  it can show problems sometimes
[negative]	[07:34]	<Skiguy>	anyone have any ideas on why azureus wouldn't run after I upgraded to 7.04? running from the terminal I get a confuzing error. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16883/

[none]	[07:35]	<Phineas>	Kellster, the ndiswrapper takes the Windows driver and wraps it making it work for Linux. The ndiswrapper wiki page should be able to walk you through the process.
[none]	[07:35]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Why memorize what you can look up?

[none]	[07:40]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: yeah
[none]	[07:40]	<xtknight>	"compwiz18, that means the superblock was damaged.  the first 512 bytes of the partition are not indicating that it is 'ext3'.  or the partition table does not contain the right data.  why dont you see whta this says for sdb1.  ""sudo fdisk -l"""
[none]	[07:40]	<liquiddoom>	BBHoss_: Scribus, Openoffice draw, and Inkscape are all good for such

[none]	[08:03]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, okay, i've uninstalled everything. should i reboot and try the nvidia installer again or should i try envy?
[positive]	[08:03]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: I have to reinstall the nvidia driver everytime I boot linux up, so I made a script for reinstalling it and getting back to X :P

[none]	[08:04]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: try rebooting and then try the nvidia installer. If it doesn't work, then use envy to remove all nvidia-related, then repeat
[none]	[08:04]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, thanks for your help so far.. i'll reboot and install now
[none]	[08:04]	<phixnay>	amaranth: for some reason feisty won't detect my cdrom drive now that it's using the scsi subsystem. I think this is a bug, but I'm not sure how to search launchpad or how to add logs, etc

[none]	[08:06]	<Amaranth>	DARKGuy: the problem it is automatically installs things in a way that's not recommended

[none]	[08:10]	<goban>	torrents are just another protocol, just like http, nothing bad about them

[none]	[08:10]	<Amaranth>	neilther1: yes

[none]	[09:33]	<micahcowan>	BlueStorm, a tar.gz is usually source code, that needs compiling. If you at all can, you should really prefer to use the packaging system (Synaptic, or apt-get). If it absolutely doesn't exist in package-form, then you'd need to install software necessary for compiling it. But then there's nothing to track dependencies or remove it later if needed.

[positive]	[12:13]	<frolle>	chowmeined: is it necessary to encrypt swap aswell? i did it on 6.10, but..?
[none]	[12:13]	<nehuen>	I did that..I first ./configure, then make and then make install.. is that it? how do I know if the program is installed...I mean..how do I use it al all..(sorry..I'm really new at this)
[none]	[12:13]	<clapper>	I'm a newby and just upgraded from ubuntu 6.06 to 7.04. I do a little embedded development using the gnu tools. Anyway, I power my target board with a USB cable. With the new version, the USB power levels fluctuate causing a powerfail on my target. If I reboot with the previous version Kernel (2.6.17-11-386 #2 Mar 13th) - there's no problem. Who/where do I go to post this issue? Thanks.
[none]	[12:13]	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you feel you want that security
[none]	[12:13]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: okay.. but i got it working by doing nothing else
[none]	[12:13]	<paolo>	am I the only one that cannot upgrade because the softwae update doesn't shoe 7.04?
[none]	[12:14]	<QOOQ>	is there any wine supported list?
[none]	[12:14]	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
[positive]	[12:14]	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do you mean by that? :)
[none]	[12:14]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, so i can play Counter-Strike if i only have this driver?
[none]	[12:14]	<psycop>	I tried running WoW through Wine, only getting 70-80fps where in windows i had 200fps
[none]	[12:14]	<chowmeined>	frolle: with swap you can even use one time keys (the data is not restored on reboot).. so it gets destroyed each time.. but this means hibernate is not available
[none]	[12:14]	<psycop>	are there any other emu. software out there?
[none]	[12:14]	<impulse>	i managed to install the driver
[none]	[12:14]	<impulse>	i will do a reboot now to see if it works
[none]	[12:15]	<velko>	clapper, you can report it on the ubuntu page. they will push it upstream if it's an upstream bug
[none]	[12:15]	<muxx>	nehuen: I don't know how to run beryl
[none]	[12:15]	<QOOQ>	thnx
[none]	[12:15]	<Kaiser>	slm
[none]	[12:15]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: i don't know anyone playing counterstrike, but i'd suppose you should.
[none]	[12:15]	<clapper>	thanks. Ciao!
[positive]	[12:15]	<frolle>	chowmeined: i am not useing that.. so efter reboot its gone.. thats for suer?
[positive]	[12:15]	<nehuen>	ok..no problem..thanx anyway :)!
[none]	[12:15]	<cheeko>	velko: the splash line isn't in the entry
[none]	[12:15]	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you want to encrypt swap.. i mean if this is a laptop which carries sensitive information encrypting swap wouldn't be a bad idea
[none]	[12:15]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: did you restart after installing the driver?
[none]	[12:15]	<muxx>	"nehuen: but if the compile ran without errors and the ""make install"" part was done with needed permissions, it should be installed"
[positive]	[12:15]	<frolle>	chowmeined: its my serv.. soo..?
[none]	[12:15]	<chowmeined>	frolle: right the setup you are using now is not one time key
[none]	[12:15]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, do you know any one that play World of warcraft with that driver
[none]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	velko: there's only lines for root, kernel, initrd, savedefault and then boot. no quiet or splash
[none]	[12:16]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, yes i restarted my system
[negative]	[12:16]	<slackern>	cheeko, 'kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=xxx ro quiet splash' thats how mine looks default
[none]	[12:16]	<velko>	"cheeko, can you post the ""kernel"" line?"
[none]	[12:16]	<nehuen>	oh..i see..then I must have installed it...I should reboot or sth..
[none]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	oh

[none]	[12:16]	<thenetduck>	is anyone running a macbook?
[none]	[12:16]	<chowmeined>	frolle: well if your server is locked up there is not really a point to encrypting the drives (because its only an issue when someone is trying to access the drives when the computer isnt running its normal os)
[positive]	[12:16]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: all i know is that i got beryl working, and i never did with an earlier version of ubuntu :) is there a linux wow client?
[none]	[12:16]	<hiways85>	be happy*
[positive]	[12:16]	<velko>	cheeko, ;-)
[none]	[12:16]	<chowmeined>	frolle: i mean the drive encryption only stops someone from accessing your stuff if they are on a livecd or something
[none]	[12:16]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__:  i play wow, but i didn't think i could on linux..
[none]	[12:17]	<drkm_>	HELP: I just installed new version of ubuntu over my old one but now my cdrom wont mount.. when I ls /dev/ there are no hda or hdb or anything I can mount.. anyone know why?
[positive]	[12:17]	<frolle>	chowmeined: perfect.. how do i delete crypt?
[none]	[12:17]	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
[none]	[12:17]	<chowmeined>	frolle: umount /media/crypt; cryptsetup remove crypt
[none]	[12:17]	<drkm_>	slackern: ok thanks
[none]	[12:17]	<hobojohn3>	is there a program out for fiesty yet that is like wicd?
[positive]	[12:17]	<frolle>	chowmeined: do you have some nice bash scripts for it aswel? :)
[none]	[12:17]	<kevin_u__>	"LegionX, Yes you can play WoW on linux, just use ""Wine"" or ""cedega"""
[none]	[12:18]	<velko>	hobojohn3, what is wicd?
[none]	[12:18]	<stefg>	slackern: it's not /that/ simple... it goes back and forth, depending on wheter libata is used or not
[positive]	[12:18]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: oh.. wine.. i hoped there were a real linux client :)
[none]	[12:18]	<stefg>	slackern: that's the reason UUID-based mounting was introduced in edgy
[none]	[12:19]	<slackern>	stefg, ahh i never had the problem myself, here my sata is still sdx and my dvd is still it's old hdc
[none]	[12:19]	<hobojohn3>	velko its an easy to use wireless network manager that lets me see all available networks and yeah i forgot i dont need it anymore

[negative]	[12:19]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about amd64-flash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[none]	[12:19]	<kevin_u_>	No, unfortunately the havent created one.
[none]	[12:20]	<chowmeined>	frolle: actually i don't use encryption that much.. but if you want something automated look into LUKS
[none]	[12:20]	<kevin_u_>	LegionX, does cedega cost any money btw?
[none]	[12:20]	<sand_storm>	i know this is a really noob question but how do i check which version of Ubuntu i have (32 or 64)
[none]	[12:20]	<patrick_>	anyone know how to get flash working on an amd64

[none]	[12:20]	<kerik>	anybody who can tell me how to make a thinkpad mouse work in ubuntu?
[none]	[12:20]	<stefg>	slackern: the CD/DVD's will still have /dev/ .... no other way possible. But be aware when you tar up a partition and put in on another. you've got to take care of the new UUID in fstab
[none]	[12:20]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: yes i think it does.. but i also heard that many people don't find it worth the money compared to the free wine
[none]	[12:20]	<chowmeined>	frolle: I know you can do things like require a usb key be plugged in and stuff
[none]	[12:20]	<Stew2>	kerik should work out of the box.
[none]	[12:20]	<AdministratorX>	86-64 is 64 bit

[none]	[12:21]	<sand_storm>	i need to dl an emulater for ps2 and it asks me

[none]	[01:00]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, it's not the CD, I installed feisty with the desktop CD which worked fine.
[none]	[01:00]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: its installed already ?
[none]	[01:01]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: then press File booting ESC and e to edit the boot line of grub
[none]	[01:01]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: perhaps the module ""evdev"" is not loaded ?"
[none]	[01:02]	<ju_>	antidrugue: how to I assert that
[none]	[01:02]	<ju_>	?
[none]	[01:02]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. What I meant before, is that it's showing the same behavior as the alternate CD did.
[none]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : you need 2 modules
[none]	[01:02]	<kevin_u_>	Is the wine package in synaptic when you install ubuntu 7.04?  because if its not i want to remove the package but i dont know how
[none]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: ""sudo modprobe psmouse"" and ""sudo modprobe evdev"""
[none]	[01:02]	<MoxJet>	What is the command to see which packages you have installed with aptitude?

[none]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : then check out again in /proc/bus/input/devices
[none]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: the live cd worked and the installation but the alternate doesn't ?
[none]	[01:03]	<MonsieurBon>	"aatdark, edit the recovery mode line which sais ""kernel ....."" and added ""noacpi"" after ""ro single"". Right?"
[none]	[01:03]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes, the live CD worked fine.
[none]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: y
[none]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can also cahnge ro single => in ro debug
[negative]	[01:03]	<ju_>	antidrugue: the output is the same : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17009/ maybe I don't know how to spot it
[none]	[01:04]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon;: then press b to boot
[none]	[01:04]	<MonsieurBon>	"aatdark, same problem with noacpi. The las line now is usually ""[ <some number>]  usb 3-3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice"

[none]	[01:05]	<moDumass>	hmmm, how do i make torrent open torrent files?
[none]	[01:05]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. same output
[negative]	[01:05]	<kerb>	this is annoying, I could always just delete all the linux specific files before and install ubuntu, now I have to copy everything that's not partitioned off onto a secondary disk just so I can install ubuntu :/
[none]	[01:06]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: is your pc a notebook ?
[none]	[01:06]	<moDumass>	by torrent i mean Ktorrent

[none]	[01:07]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can tray nousb instead of noacpi
[none]	[01:07]	<MoxJet>	compengi no output from aptitude show
[none]	[01:07]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I did a dist-upgrade from edgy which worked. now after a reinstall it doesn't.

[none]	[01:08]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: so adding ""SendCoreEvents"" should be the solution"
[none]	[01:08]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: after the distupgrade you have hdd to entries in grub for 2 different kernels , right ?
[none]	[01:08]	<velko>	YNWA, you started it as root?

[none]	[01:10]	<Stormx2>	frolle: What do you mean? Theres a few ways..
[none]	[01:10]	<velko>	YNWA, i guess so
[none]	[01:11]	<YNWA>	"well, the ""not letting me"" bit is that it doesn't let me unmount the ext3 partition"
[none]	[01:11]	<Zancat>	how much RAM would you guys recommend Feisty run on?
[none]	[01:11]	<BlueStorm>	does someone have Stepmania on linux?

[none]	[01:12]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon do you have a SATA Harddrive ?
[none]	[01:12]	<velko>	YNWA, if this is your / or /home partition you have to do it from the livecd

[none]	[03:26]	<velko>	MacPointMan, you don't need to chsck (whatever that means). hdparm will tell you if you have enabled dma. choppy playback may be the result of dma off
[none]	[03:27]	<assasukasse>	LjL: i wish to know how it goes if u disable by default
[none]	[03:27]	<antidrugue>	stefg: didn't i saw you on #debian a couple of times?
[none]	[03:27]	<assasukasse>	LjL: because i also have prelink installed, but seems that i don't have that much speed change..

[none]	[03:28]	<LjL>	assasukasse: yes, though i brought it with me from edgy
[none]	[03:28]	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, iwconfig eth1 key < is using a generated keys and not a shared password

[none]	[03:28]	<The_wrath>	velko: maybe mine doesnt have one than )=

[none]	[03:29]	<cubex>	i have a problem with my sound card. it's an intel snd-hda-intel. the sound comes from the headphones, but not on the laptop speakers
[none]	[03:29]	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, do you have something else to use ?
[negative]	[03:29]	<tom1502>	"stefg, do you think the problem might be that i use ""root=/dev/hda4"" instead of the uuid?"

[none]	[03:29]	<The_wrath>	linxeh: Thanks, found it. They didnt label it on mine for some reason
[none]	[03:30]	<assasukasse>	LjL: i did install beta 4 and upgraded from then
[none]	[03:30]	<LjL>	assasukasse: i really doubt that readahead has much to do with the poor performance increase from prelink. you know, prelink and preload are the kind of things that some people swear on, and other people say they didn't notice any difference
[none]	[03:30]	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: well, network manager
[none]	[03:30]	<velko>	MacPointMan, ok. but sorry - i have no further ideas how to improve the playback. maybe try another player?
[none]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	exzrael: by default ubuntu doesnt use the root account, so you cannot su to root. you can su to other users though
[none]	[03:30]	<stefg>	tom1502: yeak, that's the problem
[positive]	[03:30]	<LjL>	assasukasse: in that case, a profile won't hurt - though, don't expect *huge* boot-time improvements
[none]	[03:30]	<MacPointMan>	Velko.  Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate it.
[none]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	The_wrath: odd - i've never seen a keyboard without the pipe symbol
[none]	[03:30]	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: which version of ubuntu are you using?
[none]	[03:30]	<velko>	MacPointMan, np
[none]	[03:30]	<tarelerulz>	I want to remote login into kde's login manager how do I do that?
[none]	[03:30]	<tom1502>	stefg, how can i find out the correct uuid?
[none]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	The_wrath: sometimes it is two vertical bars stacked on top of each other
[none]	[03:30]	<assasukasse>	LjL: so i should just add option profile on grub menu.lst?
[none]	[03:30]	<MacPointMan>	Velko I think It has something to do with a Beryl Setting.  Ill have to check it out.

[none]	[03:31]	<LjL>	assasukasse: boot will be a lot slower than usual, since readahead will kick in and profile accessed files. then subsequent boots should be faster

[none]	[04:07]	<LjL>	!automatix | fjr, intangibleLiquid
[positive]	[04:07]	<ubotu>	fjr, intangibleLiquid: Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[none]	[04:24]	<LjL>	joseaa__: ps aux
[none]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, that could be your problem.  feisty uses different facilities than edgy in some cases.  for example, libata is now used for IDE.  and i dont think in the upgrade the fstab is updated..
[none]	[04:24]	<shockwave1>	what happened with cnr? are they still planning to add it?
[none]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	does an upgrade purge or just simply remove old packages?  what happens to your fstab for example?

[none]	[04:24]	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: the hard drive problem is fixed, but now my drivers and xorg.conf are messed up

Check your user permissions, if they grant writing permission then the next step  would be to check if the directory was mounted read-only because that is the only case where a filesystem might not let you write to a directory even if you do have the correct permissions

[none]	[07:23]	<joeyj>	andi5: that's kinda where I got to too. there's lots of press releases and stuff saying that feisty is great for virtualization, but i can't find any docs on how to actually do it. at the moment i'm wondering whether to go the kvm or vmware route
[none]	[07:23]	<qebab>	quick question: does anyone know if it is trivial or hard or impossible to run MS Visual Studio with Wine?

[none]	[07:24]	<qebab>	and I'm not sure if I want to install it now
[none]	[07:24]	<joeyj>	qebab: i tried about a year ago and it was next to impossible. vs is so heavily integrated with windows it seemed not doable (for now).

[positive]	[07:24]	<Hattori>	anybody has any pureftpd experience please?
[none]	[07:24]	<qebab>	okay, thanks
[none]	[07:24]	<delire>	qebab: eek, sounds like a mission and given the face Linux uses a different set of compilers, i don't know if it'd be worth it no? why not look into kdevelop instead?
[none]	[07:24]	<antidrugue>	qebab: doesn't eclipse-cdt fits the bill ?
[positive]	[07:24]	<andi5>	joeyj: i can tell you that vmware-player works for me... i downloaded a blank image and .vmx file and modified it to my likings.... kvm and xen somehow do not install winxp for me, right now... hope to get that fixed someday
[none]	[07:24]	<Dante123>	hi all....I have a netgear USB wireless adapter...after installing feisty...two wireless adapters show up.....one is wlan0 and the other is something like wmaster0 or something......why two?  There was only one adapter visible under edgy.....and the adapter doesn't seem to remember the wep encruption....I have to reset it each time I boot up....any thoughts?
[none]	[07:24]	<debaser>	VoX: if anyone here can help you look in the documentation at the proftpd homepage, as well as the documentation provided with it.
[none]	[07:24]	<ffm>	Hi, I think my PASSIVE FTP is not working...
[none]	[07:24]	<rbs-tito>	Dante123: the driver are probably not installed properly, try theNDISwrapper route.

[positive]	[07:24]	<qebab>	antidrugue: it's more that I wanted to use what I'm already familiar with if it wouldn't be hard to set up :) I've got no problem using another IDE if I have to
[none]	[07:25]	<Alexiel>	Thanks Artemis3
[none]	[07:25]	<delire>	Dante123: is it the WG111v2?

[none]	[07:25]	<Dante123>	any suggestions?
[none]	[07:25]	<delire>	qebab: i use Vim but have heard VS users say that it's the closest to a replacement in Linux.
[none]	[07:25]	<antidrugue>	qebab: eclipse is quite nice, please very popular in enterprise

[none]	[07:26]	<debaser>	?

[negative]	[07:26]	<delire>	qebab: true, Eclipse is another option. i develop in Python, C and C++ for Linux and use Vim, but it's not for everyone :/
[none]	[07:26]	<joeyj>	qebab: what kind of development are you doing?
[positive]	[07:26]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, interesting, btw never use wep, its as unsafe as using no encryption ;)
[none]	[07:26]	<Dante123>	i don't want to use ndiswrapper....if the card was working fine under edgy....with native stuff
[none]	[07:26]	<tuna>	does anyone have problems with sound on an imac?
[none]	[07:26]	<noelferreira>	andi5: are you sure andi5? so all the links outside /usr/lib are broken isn't it?
[negative]	[07:26]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, no problems :S
[none]	[07:26]	<mirak>	delire: there cdt a plugin for eclipse to edit c and c++
[none]	[07:27]	<qebab>	joeyj: nothing in specific (haskell, python, learning c++) as a hobby
[none]	[07:27]	<andi5>	noelferreira: huh? why that?
[none]	[07:27]	<mirak>	I have a problem with feisty on ppc, X server fail to start with my radeon8500
[none]	[07:27]	<antidrugue>	exactly, eclipse-cdt
[none]	[07:27]	<Aiwuu>	"debaser, maybe this line: root		(hd1,0) ?"
[none]	[07:27]	<delire>	mirak: yes i've heard. i just don't like Eclipse
[none]	[07:27]	<qebab>	so it's not an 'enteprise' need or anything like that
[none]	[07:27]	<mirak>	delire: how dare you ?
[positive]	[07:27]	<Dante123>	Artemis3.....like a padlock.....it keeps the honest crooks out.........that's about all I expect from it.

[none]	[07:27]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, maybe if i change to (sd2,0)?
[none]	[07:27]	<delire>	mirak: hehe, i've been using Vim for around 8 years now. you can pry it from my cold dead hands.
[none]	[07:27]	<antidrugue>	delire: blasphemy
[none]	[07:27]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, not really, check the proggies to crack into a wep wifi...
[positive]	[07:27]	<qebab>	and you are quite right delire, emacs and vim don't seem to be my thing :) a bit too strange for me still
[none]	[07:27]	<noelferreira>	because i do that and know i can't run some programs that need some librarys files andi5
[none]	[07:27]	<oo_seven>	can somebody suggest an easy to configure, lightweight http proxy server & dns server (that will just forward the dns requests) ?
[none]	[07:27]	<sigfever>	i need a recommendation for a good firewall
[none]	[07:27]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: grub doesn't manage the disks the same as linux
[none]	[07:27]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[none]	[07:27]	<mirak>	delire: vim is for cavemans
[none]	[07:28]	<joeyj>	qebab: in that case, i agree with the others... i think eclipse (+cdt) would be good for you
[negative]	[07:28]	<MoxJet>	i'm installing vmware server but I get an error doing /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl about not having a vmmon module... this is what i get http://pastebin.ca/452962
[none]	[07:28]	<rbs-tito>	sigfever: firestarter?
[none]	[07:28]	<qebab>	though I am sure they are very good when you get used to it
[none]	[07:28]	<qebab>	okay
[none]	[07:28]	<Dante123>	delire.....what do you know about netgear wg111v2?
[none]	[07:28]	<qebab>	I'll try that
[none]	[07:28]	<delire>	mirak: antidrugue i tried Eclipse, but found it too bulky and unneccessarily confusing.
[none]	[07:28]	<qebab>	thanks guys
[negative]	[07:28]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, :/
[none]	[07:28]	<ffm>	HOW CAN I tell if my camera works w/ linux>?
[none]	[07:28]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can try it, but first make sure it's correct
[none]	[07:28]	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
[none]	[07:28]	<sizzam>	if you add something to hosts.deny, do you have to source the file or something for it to go into effect?
[none]	[07:28]	<sigfever>	thanks
[none]	[07:28]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: surely it is.
[positive]	[07:28]	<andi5>	noelferreira: i think that typically every installation of a library ends with running `ldconfig', so i do not understand that :)
[none]	[07:28]	<delire>	Dante123: i know that people have problems with this particular model. is it the same as yours?
[none]	[07:28]	<antidrugue>	delire: just joking, i like VIM too, but i believe it many not be very efficient for large project
[none]	[07:29]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can check the documentation of GRUB.
[none]	[07:29]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[none]	[07:29]	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
[negative]	[07:29]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17088/
[none]	[07:29]	<neilther1>	delire: after unning that command, my computer isn booting anymore
[none]	[07:29]	<delire>	antidrugue: i've coded a few biggish projects in Vim and found it fine with a good code browser, like ctags.
[none]	[07:29]	<Faolchu>	Is there a way to have a list of users available in a drop-down menu at the login window?
[none]	[07:29]	<MonsieurBon>	can i remove laptop-detect and laptop-mode-tools on a desktop??
[none]	[07:29]	<joeamined>	how can i fix that ?
[none]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: what command?
[none]	[07:29]	<Artemis3>	harris, cron?
[none]	[07:29]	<Crav>	has anyone tried the mozilla calender program (sunbird)?
[none]	[07:29]	<Dante123>	Artemis3...you are missing my point......I put wep simply to keep my neighbour from using my wifi.......you know......as for some hacking neighbour....well.....they'd probably crack anything anyway....and there are few if any like that in my hood....now what about netgear usb
[none]	[07:29]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but I think that if the problem was with that, it should then appear another error (at least that happened to me).
[positive]	[07:29]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you sure your CD is good?
[none]	[07:29]	<neilther1>	touch /forcefsck
[positive]	[07:29]	<qebab>	antidrugue: one of my friend usually says that Vim is for sys admin kinds of people, emacs is for crazy people and always adds as an afterthought that he uses emacs :)
[none]	[07:29]	<dor>	Crav, I did
[none]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: i never told you to run that.
[none]	[07:29]	<ffm>	Crav: I reccomend Thunderbird w/ sunbird addon. Or GoogleCal.
[none]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: read the backlog
[none]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	whats that.
[none]	[07:30]	<Faolchu>	v_v
[none]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	?
[none]	[07:30]	<harris>	how?
[none]	[07:30]	<harris>	Artemis3: how?
[none]	[07:30]	<andi5>	harris: do you need precision? ... while true; do do_upload ; sleep 10 ; done loop might work as well
[none]	[07:30]	<antidrugue>	ouak, emacs, euhhh
[none]	[07:30]	<Crav>	ffm: is the addon like a plugin, or a wholly seperate program?
[none]	[07:30]	<delire>	neilther1: all i told you was to install libnewt. you're confused with someone else.
[none]	[07:30]	<abtinf>	can someone point me in the right direction... i have a fresh install of fiesty. During boot, it reaches the screen where the filling bar indicates boot progress. Every time, it reaches about a third of the way and becomes non-responsive. I can then make it move by pressing ctrl+alt+del (other keys seem to have no effect). Is there a way i can turn on logging or get rid of the graphical screen to see what is actually happening?
[positive]	[07:30]	<andi5>	harris: i mean 600, of course :)
[none]	[07:30]	<ffm>	Crav: It is an extention.
[none]	[07:30]	<harris>	I don't need precision
[none]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	delire: do u know what to do now?
[none]	[07:30]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but it works with windows doesn't it?
[none]	[07:30]	<Crav>	ffm: alright, thanks a lot, i'll check out both options
[negative]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, but i only get: Error 17: cannot mount selected partition :S and please hit any key.... and then im in grub again :S
[none]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	why its not booting after i ran that?
[none]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, nope
[none]	[07:30]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, your neighbour can use your wep as if you had used no encryption, determined people will have very hard time with wap/wap2 (psk or not) if you use a decent password
[none]	[07:30]	<ffm>	Crav: They will be able to help you better at irc.mozilla.org #firefox or #thunderbird.
[none]	[07:30]	<harris>	Could you repeat that command?
[none]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, i load windows from the hd

[none]	[07:31]	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
[none]	[07:31]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, just an advise, don't worry if you don't mind
[none]	[07:31]	<antidrugue>	abtinf: perhaps you can try the alternate CD
[none]	[07:31]	<joeamined>	please can you help ???
[none]	[07:31]	<naknomik>	I am trying ekiga. Can a windows user talk to me over Ekiga? Is Ekiga or other Windows application available for Ekiga?
[none]	[07:31]	<abtinf>	antidrugue: you mean install from the alt-cd?
[none]	[07:31]	<grayman>	abtinf, you can disable splash by editing the entry in grub
[none]	[07:32]	<wireless_trouble>	Is there a tool in the ubuntu which shows all availeble wirless networks
[none]	[07:32]	<Dante123>	I may get around to using WAP......but at the time I was setting things up......WEP was only option with my particular adapter and linux.......now that has changed..........however......to the best of my knowledge......WEP has kept innocent people out......
[none]	[07:32]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: GRUB is very powerful and lets you change boot configuration withouth changing configuration files. Thus, you can test boot configs withouth having to reboot to the live CD, edit the file and reboot.
[none]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: i have no idea what you're doing sorry. you haven't given any information or responded to what i was asking.
[none]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	abting: yaya
[none]	[07:32]	<abtinf>	grayman: ok, i'll check it out
[none]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	am i invisible ??
[none]	[07:32]	<Faolchu>	Anyone? =(
[none]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	no one wants to help ??
[positive]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: yes invisible mode
[none]	[07:32]	<andi5>	!networkmanager > wireless_trouble
[none]	[07:32]	<grayman>	abo, i assume that the system is installed
[none]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: as i said earlier, i don't know what your problem is, you're not giving any information. first you said you can't get into X, that libnewt was missing, that you have an IO error trying to isntall it, that you moved it manually, that the file is now corrupted and now your system is corrupted.
[positive]	[07:32]	<ffm>	joeamined: Yes, I cannot see you.
[positive]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: what was your question again?
[none]	[07:32]	<grayman>	abtinf, i assume that the system is installed
[none]	[07:32]	<abo>	grayman, pardon?
[none]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: frankly i have no idea what you're upto there.
[none]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[none]	[07:33]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: if you think that it could be solved by changing hd to sd, then reboot and, once in GRUB, press 'e', and edit the configuration. Is very straighforward.
[positive]	[07:33]	<grayman>	abo, wrong person :)
[none]	[07:33]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i will do?xd
[none]	[07:33]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, try one of the cracking programs and youll see how terribly easy is to fool a wep wifi.
[none]	[07:33]	<Jabop>	Hi, what is a good tool to record a desktop?
[positive]	[07:33]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: i already answered: are you use the CD is fine? are you installing from the live CD or alternate CD ?
[none]	[07:33]	<abo>	grayman, no prob
[none]	[07:33]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, so, i will change hd for sd, and if it doesnt work i will back to the livecd and edit it to hd agian
[positive]	[07:33]	<omaar>	joeamined: maybe the system is not yet completely translated to french
[none]	[07:33]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: that's exactly what you shouldn't do, its too much time.,
[positive]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, aff XD
[positive]	[07:34]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you trying to install in french ?
[none]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i can do then?
[none]	[07:34]	<Dante123>	"i'm not into hacking....but I believe you Artemis3.....its just that until now...it has been a low priority to change....and I figured WEP at least kept some ""innocent users"" from hitching a ride on my wifi......at some point I should ""upgrade"" my security...."
[positive]	[07:34]	<bliz0r>	Anyone got experience with akamaru? I got problems with dragging launchers to the bar/removing them
[none]	[07:34]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can reboot, and once in GRUB, press 'e' and edit the boot configuration.
[none]	[07:34]	<CheesyJedi>	"how do I edit the settings for ubuntu's new ""desktop effects""?"
[none]	[07:34]	<joeamined>	antidrugue, yes
[none]	[07:34]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: there you can test without loosing much time.
[none]	[07:34]	<colbert>	How do I completely remove a package?
[none]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ok ok
[none]	[07:34]	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
[none]	[07:35]	<antidrugue>	bliz0r: yes it doesn't work very well, you are better off editing the file populate-dock.sh and rerun it
[none]	[07:35]	<joeamined>	i'm using the live cd
[none]	[07:35]	<delire>	colbert: sudo dpkg -P packagename
[none]	[07:35]	<chrispche>	Hello can anyone help me. I've been using Gnome on Ubuntu for 3 months and have just installed KDE. But it is at a higher resolution. How do you change the res?
[none]	[07:35]	<chrispche>	Thanks.

[none]	[07:38]	<taggie>	Artemis3, wide open wifi is fine, as long as it's firewalled from your wired network, it adds a certain amount of plausible deniability in case of bad things happening on(or from) your network.

[positive]	[07:40]	<mikere>	ramirand: I would generally say start with server and then add - since that ends up with the least amount of extra stuff installed.

[none]	[07:41]	<delire>	wireless_trouble: this should sort it out. gnome's network-admin can be found in system->preferences i think.
[none]	[07:41]	<ffm>	kemik: Yes.

[none]	[07:45]	<delire>	Crav: AFAIK thunderbird stores mail in the mbox format, so you can just import it into whatever client you're using in Linux.

[none]	[07:47]	<taggie>	Kazol, if you have speed issues, and are running standard ubuntu, you may want to try xfce instead of gnome. you can install with: sudo apt-get install xubuntu and then you'll be able to switch back and forth between both. xfce tends to be nicer to slow procs.
[none]	[07:47]	<andi5>	Crav: you may need to show hidden files.... it is either in ~/.thunderbird or ~/.mozilla/thunderbird (sorry, i am using evolution)

[none]	[08:05]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: ok well first select the option to check disk for errors
[positive]	[08:05]	<naknomik>	DShepherd:  what do you mean? I just have a regular computer with CD driver.
[none]	[08:05]	<stellaras>	kiersie: was the answer for me?
[none]	[08:05]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes i've tried that and it freezes.
[none]	[08:06]	<DShepherd>	naknomik, have you tried to play the VCD?
[none]	[08:06]	<J^zon>	debaser: that worked
[none]	[08:06]	<kiersie>	stellaras
[none]	[08:06]	<safrus>	whenever i reboot it straight doesn't detect ubuntu at all
[none]	[08:06]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: if there are no errors, try 6.10 or 7.04 and see if that livecd works.  if not, download the alternate cd which is a text  based installer.
[none]	[08:06]	<trol0s>	antidrugue: do you know why these sort of things aren't integrated in the power management menu already..?
[none]	[08:06]	<debaser>	now type ipconfig in the command line
[none]	[08:06]	<surviver>	safrus, u have installed grub? when u boot u see the grub menu?
[none]	[08:06]	<Stig>	taggie, oh nice! thanks
[none]	[08:06]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: oh well if you try the check disk and it freezes then your burn is messed up
[none]	[08:06]	<safrus>	i dont see grub
[none]	[08:06]	<alrex021>	i try to install the ubuntu 7.04 on my PS3, but it stops on 15% every time. Could anyone pls shed some light my direction.
[none]	[08:06]	<taggie>	Stig; no problem
[none]	[08:06]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: for most people it works out of the box
[none]	[08:06]	<stellaras>	kiersie: but i have all of my works in the external
[none]	[08:06]	<stellaras>	i can't format it
[none]	[08:06]	<grogoreo>	hi
[none]	[08:06]	<Zenerek>	taggie: i'm not sure what you mean but there are no other drives seen only the two seagates, i turned of the primary ide channel that had a fat 32 drive on it, anyway i tried both oem and graphical mode, have not tried text, oh and i'm on dapper here
[none]	[08:06]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
[none]	[08:06]	<debaser>	"J^zon:  it worked by saying repeteadly ""64 bytes from...""?"
[none]	[08:07]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: You need to do an md5sum on your downloaded iso and see if it matches the md5sum on ubuntu's website. if they dont match, your download failed. if they do match, just reburn the cd and try again
[none]	[08:07]	<Flannel>	alrex021: did you verify the cd?
[none]	[08:07]	<safrus>	i dont see anything when i boot, just a message saying no OS was detected
[none]	[08:07]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... ahhhhh. that may be it. one moment. will try that again.
[none]	[08:07]	<surviver>	safrus, mzz thats quiet a prob cause the grub let u chose what u boot up so u didnt install it or its buggy
[none]	[08:07]	<J^zon>	debaser: repeatedly... four times
[negative]	[08:07]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: the things I mentioned here: http://technowizah.com/2007/01/debian-how-to-power-management.html  are really just details
[none]	[08:07]	<debaser>	J^zon: good
[none]	[08:07]	<alrex021>	Flannel: yes I did verify
[none]	[08:07]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
[none]	[08:07]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i would try the supergrubdisk, and manually install grub, and point it at Ubuntu.
[none]	[08:07]	<J^zon>	debaser: next?
[none]	[08:07]	<sam__>	hey
[none]	[08:07]	<grogoreo>	I've just backed up my /var/log folder and doing du -hs on the folder says it's 24M but when I tar it with bz2 it goes down to 5.9M. Is this right? It seems a lot lower than I thought
[none]	[08:07]	<sam__>	anyone know how to chagne the port for the apache server
[none]	[08:07]	<debaser>	J^zon: now do the same but inversely. ping the win computer from the ubuntu computer, with the same command but the correct ip
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i have it set on port 80
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	but...
[none]	[08:08]	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	it aint workin
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i need to set it to port 81
[none]	[08:08]	<debaser>	J^zon: to know the ip of the win computer use 'ipconfig' in the command line
[none]	[08:08]	<kiersie>	Hum ok ntfs is that inside 7.04
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i opened the port on my router firewall
[none]	[08:08]	<safrus>	hmmmm
[none]	[08:08]	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid adapter shouldn't be presenting anything other than the logical volumes you've told it to. the OS shouldn't magically have access to the disks directly. if it does, i don't know what to suggest.
[none]	[08:08]	<alrex021>	Flannel: its asks about some NewWorld partition
[positive]	[08:08]	<trol0s>	antidrugue: thanks, the Add To Panel thing taggie mention was something incredible I didn't know so that'll sort it out :)
[none]	[08:08]	<sam__>	but how do i change the apache server so it runs off that port....
[none]	[08:08]	<surviver>	safrus, u remember when u installed u saw in the overview what u was going to install the grub stand in it? normally its easy to see u got then a choice where u want to install grub
[none]	[08:08]	<J^zon>	debaser: ok.. brb
[none]	[08:08]	<xange>	how do I mount my hfs+ external usb drive?
[none]	[08:09]	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
[none]	[08:09]	<grogoreo>	sam__:  look in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and in your virtual machine file in /etc/apache2/sites-available
[none]	[08:09]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up?????????????/
[none]	[08:09]	<sam__>	ok in the conf
[none]	[08:09]	<sam__>	wht do i change
[none]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: what does brb means?
[none]	[08:09]	<Flannel>	sam__: it's in sites-available, theres some ports at the top
[none]	[08:09]	<safrus>	it gives you an option to pick by clicking advanced
[none]	[08:09]	<sam__>	change it to 81
[none]	[08:09]	<kiersie>	hummm....
[none]	[08:09]	<surviver>	debaser, be right back
[none]	[08:09]	<IndyGunFreak>	debaser: be right back.
[none]	[08:09]	<safrus>	first try i didn't touch it
[none]	[08:09]	<sam__>	site avalibe port
[none]	[08:09]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: in some distro the CPU frequency monitor applet is there by default (like in Fedora)
[none]	[08:09]	<Jack313>	How do i get to system>preferences>sessions???????/
[none]	[08:09]	<tatters>	/jon #mythtv-users
[none]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: anyway, if it worked we're one step closer
[none]	[08:09]	<safrus>	2nd i tried sdb2 and then i got a message saying grub failed to install
[none]	[08:09]	<Flannel>	sam__: also, you'll need to add those ports to ports.conf
[none]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: are you trying to use samba?
[none]	[08:09]	<Kazol>	Where do I get Konversation themes?
[none]	[08:10]	<taggie>	Stig and trol0s; one thing you should know about that widget on laptops, when i resume from suspend, it seems to lock my cpu into full throttle mode until i restart X, i've reported it as a bug, and i don't know if it happens for other people, just something to watch.
[none]	[08:10]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: but still CPU frequency management is enabled by default in Ubuntu (for most people), it is just the applet that isn't there by default
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	where is that??
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	ports.conf
[none]	[08:10]	<surviver>	safrus maybe try to install it and try to set the grub at some place else then maybe it works cause ur os is installed only the grub wont work
[none]	[08:10]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: usually the Live CD, jsut installs Grub, it doesn't give you a choice where to install it.
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	where is ports .conf
[none]	[08:10]	<Flannel>	sam__: in /etc/apache2
[none]	[08:10]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you booting off two hard drives.
[none]	[08:10]	<Shacker6363>	Hrmm, can anyone in here recommend me a good uTorrent alternative besides Azureus that is Gnome native?
[none]	[08:10]	<debaser>	surviver: thanks
[none]	[08:10]	<J^zon>	debaser: I don't think so.. what is samba?
[none]	[08:10]	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, over here i had i could choce between 2 or 3 palces
[none]	[08:10]	<teethdood>	"AmaroK is saying ""No MP3 support"" what do I do?"

[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	which files do i change
[none]	[08:10]	<safrus>	i have 2 hard drives
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	again
[none]	[08:10]	<Zenerek>	taggie: so you're saying that the raid card should in fact be seeing a whole mass and not two drives, well in gparted i see to disks, so i guess i'm screwed
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	ports.conf
[none]	[08:10]	<debaser>	!samba > J^zon
[none]	[08:10]	<sam__>	wht else>??
[none]	[08:10]	<Flannel>	sam__: all apache2 config stuff will be in /etc/apache2/conf

[none]	[08:11]	<GionnyBoss>	Shacker6363: deluge is gnome native. Personally, I prefere azureus, but just give deluge a try!
[none]	[08:11]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, thank you, that was definitely a PEBKAC issue
[none]	[08:11]	<safrus>	then other drive is just media storage
[none]	[08:11]	<Flannel>	sam__: ports.conf and then your virtualhost, in sites-available
[none]	[08:11]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried changing the boot sequence in your bios?
[none]	[08:11]	<antidrugue>	!mp3 > teethdood
[none]	[08:11]	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. i would like to share files
[none]	[08:11]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
[none]	[08:11]	<debaser>	KrakensDen: great!
[none]	[08:11]	<safrus>	i checked the boot sequence and it showed my sata drive being first still
[none]	[08:11]	<debaser>	J^zon: do you know now what samba is?
[none]	[08:11]	<sam__>	ok it says listen on port 81
[none]	[08:11]	<sam__>	so ...
[none]	[08:11]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats not what i meant
[none]	[08:11]	<Kazol>	Konversation is slowing down my whole computer. How can I reduce its resource usage?
[none]	[08:11]	<sam__>	it should now...
[none]	[08:11]	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. thank you
[none]	[08:11]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, try to install with u choice partitions option maybe u can set a partition for grub
[none]	[08:11]	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
[none]	[08:12]	<sam__>	if itype in my ip adress then:91
[none]	[08:12]	<sam__>	:81
[none]	[08:12]	<sam__>	it should work??
[none]	[08:12]	<Shacker6363>	thanks GionnyBoss
[none]	[08:12]	<Flannel>	sam__: please stop using the enter key as punctuation
[none]	[08:12]	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid card should see both disks, like, when your computer first does power on self test, it should display a message offering to let you configure the promise card. in that menu, you should see both disks and be able to setup a logical volume. once linux boots, you should only see that volume, not the disks behind the volume.
[none]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried CHANGING your boot sequence, to boot the other drive first...to see if grub was put on the other drive.
[none]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up samba in the ubuntu machine?
[none]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: ur welcome
[none]	[08:12]	<J^zon>	Debaser: no I haven,t
[none]	[08:12]	<Flannel>	sam__: you need to restart apache, `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart` for those changes to go into effect
[none]	[08:12]	<Stig>	taggie, on the CPU frequency monitor. Is it possible to change the CPU power settings? I can only see it tell me what speed it is running at, but can;t see how to change it;s power settings, etc.
[none]	[08:12]	<safrus>	 no i havent
[none]	[08:12]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, still here?
[none]	[08:12]	<safrus>	the other drive is ntfs though
[none]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: be a good thing to try, i8'm guessing its on the other drive.
[none]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: it doesn't matter
[none]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up the windows machine? (which doesn't need samba)
[none]	[08:13]	<Kazol>	Any ideas on reducing Konversation's resource usage and where to get themes?
[none]	[08:13]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, he installed the os its on his machine only the grub is wrong placed or configured
[none]	[08:13]	<taggie>	Stig, just click on it, it should have 4 entries: Conservative, Ondemand, Performance, Powersave
[none]	[08:13]	<Stig>	taggie: Also, do you know if I need to have two instances of CPU frequency monitor running if I have a dual core processor?
[none]	[08:13]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: yeah but im laggy
[none]	[08:13]	<delire>	Woody_: i think you have to download and install Picassa
[none]	[08:13]	<Delco2>	k
[none]	[08:13]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i know that, but if he's booting the second hard drive first.. and grub isn't loading, its probably not there.
[none]	[08:13]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
[none]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
[none]	[08:13]	<IndyGunFreak>	so odds are, its on the other drive.
[none]	[08:13]	<safrus>	how would i tell grub to install on the sata drive if i reinstall again?
[none]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	thanks delire
[none]	[08:13]	<taggie>	Stig, no the freq is the same between cores.
[none]	[08:13]	<delire>	Woody_: eg manually.. the way Windows and OS X users do.
[none]	[08:13]	<J^zon>	debaser: i had set it up previously... when the other computer was running windows
[none]	[08:13]	<infidel>	i'm having trouble upgrading is there a way to boot of the cd and upgrade?
[none]	[08:13]	<craigbass1976>	"Ok, I have efax set up with an external modem and it works fine.  How do I receive ""voice"" faxes.  These might not be any different than voicemails, but the lady I'm setting this up for has win95 and some fax program that accepts such voice faxes."
[none]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	okay
[none]	[08:13]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: hmmm not sure about nomda
[positive]	[08:13]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, jup that can explain it he can also try to reinstall and set choice of grub to hd0
[none]	[08:14]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: if i were you, i would reboot, and set whatever drive is set to boot second, to boot first, and see what hapens
[none]	[08:14]	<J^zon>	debaser: i am attempting to migrate over
[none]	[08:14]	<|ringo|>	"Delco2: sure its not ""noDMA""?"
[none]	[08:14]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: again, several ubuntu installs, and i've never been given a choice where to install grub.
[none]	[08:14]	<Stig>	"taggie, nothing happeneds when I left click, when I right click I see the normal taskbar options of ""preferences, help, about, remove from panel"" etc... :O"
[none]	[08:14]	<debaser>	J^zon: good. There are several ways to setup samba, the faster is to edit config files.
[none]	[08:14]	<amro>	Middle mouse button won't work, but it worked fine under 6.10
[none]	[08:14]	<debaser>	J^zon: a good decision.
[none]	[08:14]	<infidel>	!upgrade
[negative]	[08:14]	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[none]	[08:14]	<markus_>	on edgy i had to run sox to make my intel hda soundcard capture line-in for watching tv. now with the feisty upgrade things just stopped working. no more sound in tv (btw: my iremote stopped working also)
[none]	[08:14]	<safrus>	when i look at the other drive shouldn't i see grub installed there?
[none]	[08:14]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes. but its command line was nodma. probably the same thing
[none]	[08:14]	<surviver>	IndygunFreak, lol strange i've got 2 choices :s
[none]	[08:14]	<taggie>	Stig, no sure why, what kind of laptop/processor?
[none]	[08:14]	<delire>	Woody_: you might want to take a look at f-spot. in many ways it's better than Picassa. sudo apt-get install f-spot
[none]	[08:14]	<J^zon>	debaser: so.. what do i do next?
[positive]	[08:15]	<debaser>	J^zon: I can explain you how to configure samba with commandline, or you can look for a manual in internet. What do you prefer?
[none]	[08:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no... listen.. restart your computer, go into your bios, and set your secondary drive, to boot first.... save changes and exit.
[none]	[08:15]	<Woody_>	ah okay delire
[none]	[08:15]	<safrus>	hd0 or hd1?

[negative]	[08:15]	<delire>	Woody_: http://f-spot.org/Main_Page

[none]	[08:15]	<J^zon>	debaser: will the manual be clear?
[none]	[08:15]	<scott_>	hey, can anyone point me to a feisty guide on manually installing the nvidia drivers through nvidia installer? since new beta drivers just came out and i want to try them
[none]	[08:15]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
[none]	[08:15]	<safrus>	indy i have to reinstall regardless cause i fubared the last install
[none]	[08:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: well, i don't see how you did that, but ok, whatever you want to do, but i would see if grub is working first.
[none]	[08:16]	<danieltellez_>	hi!
[positive]	[08:16]	<debaser>	J^zon: it will be surely more clear than me, and explained better.
[none]	[08:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: that way if there is a problem, we can address it now before you reinstall.
[none]	[08:16]	<debaser>	*clearer
[none]	[08:16]	<taggie>	Stig, i don't know, it's possible there's no throttling support for the 7200 yet, but i don't know why that would be. what does the display say? 100% all the time?
[none]	[08:16]	<Stig>	It says it is running at 1Ghz in the CPU frequency monitor
[none]	[08:16]	<safrus>	because i told grub to install to sdb2 which isn't a valid location apparantly
[none]	[08:16]	<taggie>	stig, that's odd.
[none]	[08:16]	<Stig>	60%
[none]	[08:16]	<Stig>	50%
[none]	[08:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you using the alternate install cd, or the live CD?

[none]	[09:03]	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: Okay, goto System->Administration->Printing, click on add a new printer. Select the printer that is connected (hopefully it at least sees it). Then when it asks you to select a driver push the Install Driver button
[none]	[09:03]	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: yes, i verified md5sum, and it was a match
[none]	[09:03]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: no.  That 256 is memory required to install via liveCD (which is up from 192 in edgy), Alt CD still installs on stuff with tiny memories.
[none]	[09:03]	<rob-west>	im using Virtual Machine stuff to try the new Ubuntu

[none]	[09:25]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB I assume you want me to do X11 to narrow it down to Gnome or X?
[none]	[09:26]	<safrus>	its a razer copperhead

[none]	[09:27]	<safrus>	its just consistent with linux

[none]	[09:27]	<Flannel>	ariks: Nice.  Well, That's a bug in launchpad I guess.  Theyve changed the UI... in the past few days even.  Seem to be infected by web two point oh.   Do you have javascript enabled?  Since, theres been bugs reported... even two minutes ago.
[none]	[09:27]	<safrus>	usb
[none]	[09:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no idea.

[none]	[09:28]	<safrus>	its a gaming mouse, not really standard
[none]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,   does pan support ssh ?  its a good news aggregator
[none]	[09:28]	<aro>	Thanks eternaljoy
[none]	[09:28]	<safrus>	since it operates at 2000 dpi

[none]	[09:28]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, whats aggregator mean?
[none]	[09:28]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: yeah it might do them some good to put that on there
[none]	[09:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats probably part of the prob... i've got a cheap best buy brand 2 buttons and wheel mouse.. 12 bucks, works fine.
[none]	[09:28]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: with all linux, there really aren't 'minimums' per sey.  You just get a sliding scale of responsiveness and stuff.
[none]	[09:28]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, and no, it doesnt support SSL.
[none]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  news reader and organizer

[none]	[09:28]	<nakor>	so I guess my question really is, how can I tell what version of ubuntu is installed from the command line. Thanks.
[none]	[09:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you sure you edited your menu correctly, so it will work when you reboot?
[none]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  ahh ok  didnt know - I use pan

[none]	[09:29]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: ok, good luck./.
[none]	[09:29]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, from the xterm you start gnome-session
[none]	[09:29]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: well, there are minimums, but the minimum is so astronomically low (and gives you crappy quality) that most people wouldnt have that issue
[none]	[09:29]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, may I pls PM you for 2secs?
[none]	[09:29]	<leroi_>	when i have gdesklets running and i open firefox it takes me to www.%n.com instead of my home page
[none]	[09:29]	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: actually, that alien -i command needs to be run through sudo
[none]	[09:29]	<safrus>	thanks for help, its appreciated

[none]	[09:31]	<Kensey>	I've got Beryl running and having two issues: 1) Terminal Server *really* hates it when I change a setting, so much so that the entire box locks up.  2) Somehow my cube is no longer a cube - when I hit Ctrl-Alt-[arrow]  I just get a flat set of thumbnail icons and the desktop flips.  Any ideas?
[none]	[09:31]	<h4wk>	Ahh
[none]	[09:31]	<antidrugue>	h4wk_: make sure in System->Administration->Software Repositories
[none]	[09:31]	<Flannel>	sc0tch: No.  Its a lot different than generic.  Dont believe it contains any of the optional optomizations (that get detected and used), it's there incase your processor doesn't like those detections
[none]	[09:31]	<talisein>	sc0tch: the kernel is adaptive. If your system supports SMP, it will include SMP support. If not, it will automatically delete the SMP from itself

[none]	[10:12]	<kahrytan>	soundray: Because Gnome hangs on login after logging out from previous session. Firestarter hangs unless Gnome is loaded via xterm.

[none]	[10:48]	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: that's pretty odd.  I wish I had more information for you.
[none]	[10:48]	<ferret_0567>	You must not have the Kubuntu KDM theme installed if your using KDM
[none]	[10:48]	<kahrytan>	soundray: rebooted X.
[none]	[10:48]	<ferret_0567>	For GDM, you changed the settings
[none]	[10:48]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: I'm not a guru and I don't know what you're talking about, what I know is that a partition is, in linux, a device node in /dev directory. Gnome and KDE abstract that and represent the disks, but I don't think they give access to partition tables, mostly gnome.
[none]	[10:48]	<knoppix_>	hi
[none]	[10:48]	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: I may have been messing with my network and card settings way to much, is there a way to reset all those settings, without reinstalling the OS?
[none]	[10:48]	<sam__>	got a question, how do run a program like ventrilo, i downloaded the tar.gz now... i unzipped it, and it has the config file, program file, and everything all in a folder

[none]	[10:49]	<sam__>	start the server service i guess you could say
[none]	[10:49]	<elsni>	delire: yes, i can imagine. I was just impressed that nearly everything else worked out of the box, even wlan!
[none]	[10:49]	<debaser>	sam__: you must surely compile it
[none]	[10:49]	<soundray>	kahrytan: the problem is most likely not your gnome or gtk installation, but the config settings in your home directory.
[none]	[10:49]	<sam__>	how?
[none]	[10:49]	<Dextorion>	snap: Then i dont know. The default login panel for gdm comes with options for that. I dont know if your running gdm though..  Might be kde's manager peharps. No idea.
[none]	[10:49]	<sam__>	how do i compile it
[none]	[10:49]	<chernobylrpgfree>	"FeistyFlamer7: Not to my knowledge.  You could try cleaning out the changes to /etc/network/interfaces, then ""sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0"""

[none]	[10:49]	<Sjimmie>	sam__: type: less INSTALL
[none]	[10:49]	<Seb3DGE>	what I mean is that a partition should be invisible if the partition table is erased... but perhaps it's not, since I can navigate the disk...
[none]	[10:49]	<debaser>	sam__: pastebin the content of the directory please
[positive]	[10:49]	<Sjimmie>	or something :)

[none]	[10:51]	<soundray>	kahrytan: you have to add the new user to the admin group
[none]	[10:51]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yeah.  You'll have to figure out what image you want for your icon, and make a change to gconf (dont know off the top of my head)
[none]	[10:51]	<kahrytan>	Soundray: I just get Metacity theme and blank box inside.
[none]	[10:52]	<snap>	my memory might not be correct but SuSe i could flip from different x-windows managers w/ reloging

[none]	[10:52]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: do u have a clue on how to change settings?
[none]	[10:52]	<kahrytan>	soundray: And I am logged in as such. Just in case I needed to edit a file.
[none]	[10:52]	<soundray>	kahrytan: I take it back
[none]	[10:52]	<LightHammer>	i would replace the ubuntu logo with the gnome food
[none]	[10:52]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: it boot at startup so i dunno how to change some setting..

[none]	[10:52]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yes.  I just don't remember what setting to change.
[none]	[10:52]	<sam__>	is there anyway to integrate it??
[none]	[10:53]	<defjux_>	how can i restart my shell?
[none]	[10:53]	<debaser>	(in grub)
[none]	[10:53]	<kahrytan>	soundray: Wouldn't the fact window doesn't load be related to gnome hanging?
[none]	[10:53]	<elsni>	delire: yes, I only dicovered one more issue: wake up does not work after suspend to ram. And going to suspend mode takes very long time. But I dont use this normally, so I dont care.
[none]	[10:53]	<sam__>	is there anyway to make the linux server do taht on start up
[none]	[10:53]	<sam__>	run a program like taht??
[none]	[10:53]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: I know that pure-ftpd have start flags for almost everything. I remembering doing somthing quite uggly to get those settings at boot. heh
[none]	[10:53]	<LightHammer>	ok thanks, another question do you know where i can get a gnome-food icon? a real icon not a picture from it?
[positive]	[10:53]	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: could you please tell me what to type in terminal to do so, since I'm a newbie? :P :D
[none]	[10:53]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: like setting them in directly in the start script or something like that.
[none]	[10:53]	<soundray>	kahrytan: probably, but the problem could still be in the config files in your home dir.
[none]	[10:53]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: how? editing the script?
[positive]	[10:54]	<Jove``>	sam__: Section 3 of ventrilo_srv.htm tells you quite explicitly how to do it.

[none]	[10:54]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I am thinking GTK+ because it is the window manager. Whats the command for term?
[none]	[10:54]	<sam__>	ok thanxs

[none]	[10:54]	<Jove``>	Yup
[none]	[10:54]	<soundray>	kahrytan: gtk isn't the window manager. The wm is called metacity

[none]	[11:25]	<soundray>	deep: you need very little computational power for that. Any old Pentium will do. Even a 486, but those are rare now...
[none]	[11:25]	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: I don't think gparted can find lost partitions
[none]	[11:25]	<boojit>	deep: you're just routing stuff between two interfaces, with probably a dhcp server thrown in for good measure. As soundray said, you can do that with a pentium.
[none]	[11:25]	<boojit>	lesser hardware does exactly that on linux-based network appliances

[none]	[11:35]	<jandro>	hello, I have got an avi file (got from a dv video camera) which when i try to play it, totem just display 0:00 (Streaming), and doesn't do anything else. Any idea about what's going on? Thanks

[none]	[11:35]	<grayman>	badkitt1, hmmm, what kind of networking it got? do you get a seperate ip for it?
[none]	[11:35]	<randy>	Hey all.
[none]	[11:35]	<weltschmerz>	mstevens then when rsync just ran, to back up my database on my second hard drive, which is just for backup storage of my music, it erased all my music.
[none]	[11:35]	<coal>	woah
[none]	[11:35]	<weltschmerz>	on the backup.
[none]	[11:35]	<grayman>	badkitt1, or share hosts ip
[none]	[11:35]	<weltschmerz>	why did feisty do this?
[none]	[11:35]	<badkitt1>	grayman: It is a different ip address than the host computer yes
[negative]	[11:35]	<coal>	i don't think i have a card :c
[none]	[11:35]	<safrus>	anyone that can help me with resolution problem?
[none]	[11:35]	<coal>	it's just an adapter
[none]	[11:35]	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: same thing haha
[none]	[11:36]	<randy>	Anyone use a wintv pvr go under Feisty?
[none]	[11:36]	<coal>	lul
[none]	[11:36]	<grayman>	badkitt1, should work normally
[none]	[11:36]	<coal>	i'm not sure where the driver is
[none]	[11:36]	<soundray>	[22:28]  <soundray> cotton: identify the names of the packages you want to get rid of. Then run 'sudo apt-get --purge remove package1 package2' etc.
[none]	[11:36]	<Zerro>	do someone can help me with a problem with beryl ? when i run beryl-manager after it starts up all my windows get border less and i can't move them also none of the themes works but there is a cube desktop etc.

[none]	[11:36]	<grayman>	badkitt1, what prevents you from forwarding?
[none]	[11:36]	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: thats the important thing, really.  You'll need the driver disk for that adapter, or at least the driver's SYS file.
[none]	[11:36]	<badkitt1>	grayman but the regular ip is xxx.xxx.0.x but the ubuntu ip is getting xxx.xxx.258.x or something

[none]	[11:37]	<badkitt1>	So the router tells me I cant forward to this ip because of perhaps a different subnet???

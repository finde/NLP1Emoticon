[neutral]	[12:31]	<Gigi>	A hard drive USB case (for 2.5'' drives) the brand is Mad Dog
[positive]	[12:31]	<dannydrifffft>	is the nvidia geforce 7800GT supported by ubuntu 7.04?

[negative]	[12:32]	<zerro>	done that but the problem is that when i try to play videos at video.google.com i just get black screen and not more and firefox is not saying that it is missing plugins
[negative]	[12:32]	<hhlp>	i understand thx
[positive]	[12:32]	<Fylk>	And its not for laptop drives, just a smaller form factor.

[negative]	[12:33]	<enyc>	"hhlp: but this is likely to cause some problems SOMEWHERE... jsut hopefully lal the most important problems have been either fixed... or had the ""use libata for this chipset"" switched-off before feisty released!"

[neutral]	[12:49]	<ffm>	eck: What is nmap?
[neutral]	[12:49]	<eck>	ffm: e.g. sudo nmap -A some.ftp.server.com
[positive]	[12:49]	<avb>	selinuxium: first command will mount your iso to /cdrom
[neutral]	[12:49]	<carlhempel>	ffm: port scanner
[positive]	[12:49]	<eck>	ffm: port scanner, you will need to grab it from the repos

[neutral]	[12:49]	<avb>	selinuxium: second will add it as a source for apt

[negative]	[12:50]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, from what I understand there are linked files fotlinks harlinks and a bunch of other stuff I don' t know about
[negative]	[12:50]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: while you could use cp -r /home /mnt/home there are safer ways to make sure your home partition is kept intact
[neutral]	[12:50]	<ffm>	eck: web-based external port scanner
[positive]	[12:50]	<velko>	randomwalker, just click with the mouse on the combination you want to change and press the key you want to associate

[negative]	[01:00]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: you want to own your entire home directory, unless you have set it up differently, not obvisously when you build something or use sudo the ownership changes

[negative]	[01:12]	<idefixx>	Rodya|Laptop: the update process asked me if I wanted to restart - so you should be able to keep using the 'old/new' system even though i wouldnt advise this.
[negative]	[01:12]	<killerKlown>	i'm running 7.04 2.6.20-15-generic
[negative]	[01:12]	<iain>	i'm getting an intermittent error on hybernation resume.

[neutral]	[01:12]	<iain>	does anyone know how to reboot the sound module? eg from consol
[negative]	[01:12]	<underwatercow>	Does anyone know why Gparted won't let me resize into space before the partition?
[negative]	[01:12]	<Kazol>	underwatercow: Does the default installation block all ranges of IPs? Just curious, why did you uninstall it? Is there a better program?
[negative]	[01:13]	<darnell>	ok so this mail thing is obviously not a problem with my isp..
[negative]	[01:13]	<iain>	I've tried using modprobe -r but I'm being told the module is in use
[negative]	[01:13]	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to remove all traces of a program that i installed from a binary (.bin)? it doesnt show up in synaptic, i installed it in a folder in /usr/lib/. do i just delete the folder that i installed it to?
[negative]	[01:13]	<darnell>	i used a different one and the same thing is happening
[negative]	[01:13]	<darnell>	whats going on with evolution?
[negative]	[01:13]	<Rodya|Laptop>	idefixx, i'm asking if the download process works the same as in synaptic, if a download gets messed up, can it be restarted later?
[negative]	[01:13]	<what_if>	how large should a ubuntu /boot partition be ??

[positive]	[01:14]	<randomwalker>	darnell, its totally going on, don't listen to the creationists
[positive]	[01:14]	<underwatercow>	Kazol: to my knowledge It blocks ranges known to be used for certain purposes. I don't use it lately because I switched to Ubuntu and haven't bothered trying to get it again as it never seemed to do anything but be in the way anyway
[negative]	[01:14]	<iain>	sid> no such command over here....
[neutral]	[01:14]	<darnell>	fuck off.
[negative]	[01:14]	<underwatercow>	so no one in here knows how to partition a hard drive? sad...

[neutral]	[01:14]	<ubotu>	darnell: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[neutral]	[01:14]	<idefixx>	Rodya|Laptop: yes, but the updater starts installing the downloaded packages immediately once its finished
[negative]	[01:14]	<eck>	Tarkus: delete that folder, and if you really want to get everything try to look at the shell script and see if it installed any files to other places (e.g. /etc)
[negative]	[01:14]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: what you could do, if you are not too uncomfortable with this is chown everything under your name for the copy and then chown her name back to her ~ directory when the copy is done
[negative]	[01:14]	<Shaba1>	hello how do I adjust the time to start the default OS on grub?
[negative]	[01:14]	<darnell>	yeah
[negative]	[01:14]	<iain>	i've played with the alsamixer though and through the gui doesn't make a difference

[neutral]	[01:15]	<njal>	Can anyone help me get the rt73 driver working
[neutral]	[01:15]	<njal>	the Wiki DOESN'T work
[negative]	[01:15]	<Rodya|Laptop>	idefixx, so it downloads package A, installs package A, downloads package B, installs package B, etc... instead of downloading A,B,...,Z then installing A,B,...Z?
[negative]	[01:15]	<yigal>	 IncredibleHink: however this could be dangerous, and I am not sure about the home directory like soft links going to her home could now go to your home etc..?  but everything should be intact
[negative]	[01:15]	<iain>	i thought there might be an /etc/init.d/alsa restart command or something
[positive]	[01:15]	<stas>	on dapper drake I used to be able to log in as root with a regular GUI session, I upgraded to Fiery and now it won't let me log in as root.  Basically I need a graphical file manager with root privileges.
[negative]	[01:15]	<Tarkus>	eck: alright, would deleting the folder also get rid of the launcher in my applications menu?
[negative]	[01:15]	<darnell>	there is a problem ok..
[positive]	[01:16]	<iain>	or a way to overide the 'this module is in use'

[neutral]	[01:16]	<kitche>	darnell: is this on a custom email server or though your ISP?
[neutral]	[01:16]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: you have to use find . -depth -print0 | sudo cpio null sparse -pvd /mnt/newhome/
[negative]	[01:16]	<eck>	"Tarkus: I think there is a .desktop file for that, or something of that nature. Try running something like: find / -iname ""*some_search_string*"""

[negative]	[01:17]	<darnell>	connection times out after 10 minutes or so
[negative]	[01:17]	<IndyGunFreak>	darnell: then you probably haven't set it up correctly
[positive]	[01:17]	<yigal>	you are using your permissions on the copy so you will get permission denied etc.

[neutral]	[01:18]	<iain>	*rubs his eyes and looks upset
[negative]	[01:18]	<darnell>	what is another good email client
[neutral]	[01:18]	<jamesm>	ty
[negative]	[01:18]	<iain>	pretty please?
[negative]	[01:18]	<underwatercow>	eck: do you know why gparted can't resize into the free space before the partition? it only resizes into free space that follows.
[neutral]	[01:18]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: s/to/tell
[neutral]	[01:18]	<wallydalla1>	what is the rt73 driver?  network card?
[negative]	[01:18]	<Ademan>	darnell: what are you using? i recomend evolution
[neutral]	[01:18]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, like a charm
[neutral]	[01:18]	<iain>	whoever answers can use my sister?
[negative]	[01:18]	<darnell>	i use evolution
[positive]	[01:18]	<Ademan>	darnell: it works fine with my earthlink account, and my gmail account
[positive]	[01:18]	<eck>	"underwatercow: I believe it is a limitation of the filesystem, afaik there aren't any that you can resize from the ""left"""
[neutral]	[01:19]	<darnell>	the guys at earthlink told me that the ports are 25 and 587
[negative]	[01:19]	<darnell>	no idea what 587 is
[positive]	[01:19]	<eck>	underwatercow: for some filesystems you can snapshot them and then move them, but it is a bit of work
[negative]	[01:19]	<sartan>	Still no native WPA support in the 7.04 huh.. I'm dissapointed.... (IPW2200)
[positive]	[01:19]	<Ademan>	darnell: you might try thunderbird if you don't like evolution
[negative]	[01:19]	<lmosher>	I have an intel T2500 and cpu frequency scaling is apparently disabled. How do I fix this?
[neutral]	[01:19]	<yigal>	darnell: smtp?
[neutral]	[01:19]	<darnell>	yes
[positive]	[01:19]	<darnell>	the pop3 is fine
[neutral]	[01:19]	<ajehuk>	darnell - the correct client smtp port
[neutral]	[01:19]	<yigal>	darnell: google uses 587
[neutral]	[01:19]	<wallydalla1>	can anyone help me with installing a wireless card in my 6.06 computer?
[neutral]	[01:19]	<yigal>	darnell?
[negative]	[01:19]	<underwatercow>	eck: so what do I do if I make a leading parition too small and need to resize? I won't be able to pull it from the next partition, will I?
[negative]	[01:19]	<darnell>	ok, so i need port 25
[neutral]	[01:19]	<eck>	darnell: if you look at /etc/services it lists what services are associated with what ports
[neutral]	[01:19]	<obz>	sigh.
[neutral]	[01:19]	<Hor|zon>	iain: sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
[negative]	[01:20]	<GenNMX>	lmosher: That's an issue for your BIOS. Hit F1, DELETE, ESC, F2, etc. to enter your BIOS immediatly after turning on your computer.
[positive]	[01:20]	<lmosher>	GenNMX, Promise you it isn't. Works great in XP.
[neutral]	[01:20]	<Gunrun>	its normally delete
[negative]	[01:20]	<PurpZeY>	Is there some reason my printer won't print a test page? Ubuntu shows it as recognized, and recognized as a proper device but it won't actually print anything.
[negative]	[01:20]	<IceGuest_7>	anyone have a link to tutorial to drop gnome and add kde?  I don't feel like installing kubuntu just to get kde
[neutral]	[01:20]	<darnell>	25 is for mail
[neutral]	[01:20]	<wallydalla1>	BIOS setup can be   DEL key,  or f2   or F10
[negative]	[01:20]	<lando__>	whats the name of the admins group
[negative]	[01:20]	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
[neutral]	[01:20]	<lando__>	so i can add myself through the terminal
[positive]	[01:21]	<ajehuk>	darnell - both are mail
[negative]	[01:21]	<eck>	underwatercow: no, unfortunately not. If you were using lvm you could add more space, but ifyou are just doing a regular non-lvm setup you need to do it manually (i.e. back up everything, resize, restore everything)
[negative]	[01:21]	<BlueScreenKid>	yuckity ... yuckity .. yuck ... to get my ati 9600xt to work properly i had to use non-open source drivers ... where on edgy i could use open source .. why this backwards step :(
[positive]	[01:21]	<GenNMX>	I'd had plenty of motherboards with the BIOS as F1, it's up to the firmware manufacturer....
[neutral]	[01:21]	<wallydalla1>	I have read all the madwi documentation.
[negative]	[01:21]	<Ademan>	anyone know how to set the gtk+ theme white you're using a different window manager? (such as iceWM or fluxbox)
[negative]	[01:21]	<darnell>	right, but why wont it send
[negative]	[01:21]	<underwatercow>	eck: that sucks, lol... thanks though... think 30Gib is enough for /?
[neutral]	[01:21]	<darnell>	its set correctly
[negative]	[01:21]	<BlueScreenKid>	IceGuest ... install kunbuntu .. instead of ubuntu
[positive]	[01:21]	<eck>	Ademan: I believe it is done by setting it in your .gtkrc
[neutral]	[01:21]	<ajehuk>	darnell - what is happening?
[neutral]	[01:21]	<GenNMX>	lmosher: Do you mean dynamic switching?
[neutral]	[01:21]	<eck>	underwatercow: that's plenty
[negative]	[01:21]	<darnell>	earthlink tried to tell me that they dont support linux..
[neutral]	[01:21]	<Ademan>	eck: thanks, i'll try that
[positive]	[01:21]	<Hor|zon>	underwatercow: if you have other partitions for music etc. then 15gb is enough
[neutral]	[01:22]	<d0lph1nK1ng>	anyone know which driver to install to get an ATI TV Wonder Elite tv tuner card working?
[neutral]	[01:22]	<darnell>	well, i can receive emails, but when i'm sending..

[negative]	[01:22]	<darnell>	it just sits there.. and finally it times out
[negative]	[01:22]	<iain>	oh dear .............
[negative]	[01:22]	<ajehuk>	darnell - should make no difference if they do or not
[neutral]	[01:22]	<arooni>	how easy is it to upgrade to feisty from edgy ?
[positive]	[01:22]	<wallydalla1>	6.06 shows me that madwifi is installed,  but the wifi card I purchased seems to be too new.  it is a new 802.11 G card  made in 2006

[neutral]	[01:22]	<darnell>	i know
[negative]	[01:22]	<darnell>	thats what i told them..
[negative]	[01:22]	<ajehuk>	darnell - whats the problem?
[negative]	[01:22]	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: I am making a home partition too
[neutral]	[01:22]	<Hor|zon>	iain, did you sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart ?
[neutral]	[01:22]	<iain>	i managed to restart alsa now (thanks to horijzon!) but it hasn't helped. I still ahve no sound.

[neutral]	[01:22]	<darnell>	holdon..
[neutral]	[01:22]	<ajehuk>	iain - have you run alsaconf?
[negative]	[01:22]	<Hor|zon>	lol underwatercow, then 10gigs should do...
[negative]	[01:22]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, how do i make it mount on every bootup now?
[negative]	[01:22]	<darnell>	im going to delete the account and reenter it
[negative]	[01:23]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, i understand i have to edit the /etc/fstab file
[negative]	[01:23]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, but what do i put in it
[negative]	[01:23]	<underwatercow>	Hor|zon: isn't it a good principle to leave half of the root/operating system free?
[negative]	[01:23]	<darnell>	ok..
[neutral]	[01:23]	<d0lph1nK1ng>	BlueScreenKid, no it doesn't.  thanks, tho
[neutral]	[01:23]	<ajehuk>	iain (sudo alsaconf)
[negative]	[01:23]	<darkram>	In 7.04 desktop effects is actually Compiz?

[negative]	[01:23]	<arooni>	hey folks... how should i upgrade to feisty from edgy?
[positive]	[01:23]	<idefixx>	darnell: sad but true
[negative]	[01:23]	<randomwalker>	darkram: yeah
[neutral]	[01:23]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, just change the /etc/fstab line for /home to use /dev/sdb
[neutral]	[01:23]	<eck>	underwatercow: if the FS gets too full you will get fragmentation
[neutral]	[01:23]	<darnell>	username is darnell@earthlink.net
[positive]	[01:23]	<darkram>	thanks
[negative]	[01:24]	<Hor|zon>	and create a new line for the old partition if you want to use that for something else
[negative]	[01:24]	<darnell>	for authentication do i need password or login?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<idefixx>	darnell: that wasnt for you
[negative]	[01:24]	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: do programs install to the root partition typically?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<dts>	where would error logs for sound be?
[negative]	[01:24]	<Gigi>	I'm changing configurations on Beryl  but I do not see no difference.  Why?
[negative]	[01:24]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, there is not one for home
[negative]	[01:24]	<BlueScreenKid>	i'm gonna unplug my scanner .. it is making weird noise .. and i never use it .. lol
[neutral]	[01:24]	<locolbd>	arooni:
[negative]	[01:24]	<yigal>	 IncredibleHink: I am not so good with fstab, you should use a udev id that you create, someone in here should know, but I am not sure exactly, you can always use /dev/sdb1 /home but udev is a better way to go so get some one who knows how to do it with udev
[neutral]	[01:24]	<Furthur>	arooni : @HLINK
[negative]	[01:24]	<Hor|zon>	underwatercow: they do unless you tell them not to, and the settings are stored on /home
[negative]	[01:24]	<arooni>	logicecx: ok
[negative]	[01:24]	<eck>	underwatercow: most of the files go in /usr, a few files go in other places. /var is where you would hold files that might change, so usually that would be email, a website, ftp, etc.
[negative]	[01:24]	<Dimicus>	Anyone know any software that can help to make integrated software better ? i have the problem that i can only have 1 sound device on at the time. i use a integrated realtek sound card.
[neutral]	[01:25]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, thx... ill ask around
[neutral]	[01:25]	<locolbd>	arooni: @HLINK
[negative]	[01:25]	<eck>	underwatercow: apt also stores a bunch of stuff in /var you can clean out
[negative]	[01:25]	<iain>	ajehuk>  i don't have that command I don't think. As in it doesn't show up when pressing tab to saee available commands
[negative]	[01:25]	<IncredibleHink>	"Can someone help me have a partition get mounted on every bootup""?"
[neutral]	[01:25]	<eck>	underwatercow: try du -sh /var/cache
[neutral]	[01:25]	<idefixx>	Gigi: have u selected the beryl window manager or are you still using metacity?
[neutral]	[01:25]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, I can help with the udev rule, but is the drive going to be in that hot swap bay?
[negative]	[01:25]	<rio>	where do i set up multiple displays?
[negative]	[01:25]	<darnell>	ok, same thing
[neutral]	[01:25]	<Stormx2>	IncredibleHink: file system?
[negative]	[01:25]	<Tarkus>	"how do i remove a directory in a terminal? when i run ""sudo rmdir *directory name*"" it says ""Directory not empty"". i know its not empty, i want to remove everything in it. any ideas?"
[negative]	[01:25]	<Hor|zon>	if it is then yes you need the udev rule
[negative]	[01:25]	<Gigi>	idefixx how do I know that?
[neutral]	[01:25]	<Stormx2>	Tarkus: rm -rf directoryname (use with care)
[negative]	[01:25]	<ajehuk>	iain - you need to run it as root (sudo alsaconf), depending on your config users cannot normally see commands that only root can run
[neutral]	[01:25]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, i ahvent got the hotswap bay yet,..... i just got my /home copied to the new internal
[negative]	[01:26]	<BlueScreenKid>	IncredibleHink : sorry . missed what you asked before .. what partition is it ?
[positive]	[01:26]	<eck>	underwatercow: nearly all the space reported by that command can be freed up by running apt-get clean
[neutral]	[01:26]	<arooni>	are there any apps that will be broken if i upgrade to feisty?
[negative]	[01:26]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, then you don't need the udev rule I wouldn't think...it should stay the same
[positive]	[01:26]	<idefixx>	Gigi: do you have the beryl icon in your tray? the gem thingy next to the clock?
[positive]	[01:26]	<Tarkus>	Stormx2: thanks

[neutral]	[01:26]	<eck>	billy: it is configured in your client

[negative]	[01:26]	<eck>	billy: i.e. you can use any ports whatsoever
[negative]	[01:27]	<Tarkus>	"Stormx2: is it ""rm -rf"" or ""rmdir irf""?"
[negative]	[01:27]	<ajehuk>	iain if you dont have it try installing the alsa-utils

[neutral]	[01:28]	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: What do you guys do about storing documents and music, etc... do you put them in home? it kind of bothers me not having control of other things being saved there

[neutral]	[01:29]	<Hor|zon>	chance*
[negative]	[01:29]	<eck>	underwatercow: so actually i don't have /home on another partition... the reason I do this is so I can boot into another distro or install and still access all my documents and have the freedom to use different configs for all my apps

[negative]	[01:30]	<idefixx>	Gigi: if you started the Beryl Manager there should be the try icon i was talking about.
[positive]	[01:30]	<eck>	underwatercow: but it is basically the same in principle as having a separate /home partition
[negative]	[01:30]	<iain>	ajehuk> sound works fine except in a quirky way when hybernate is resumed. Even then only intermittently (think it depends whether it was playing something when it goes into hybernate but not yet sure)...so the sound setup I've got *does* work.....

[negative]	[01:31]	<randomwalker>	lando__: i guess you could manually add yourself in /etc/groups to all the groups you want
[negative]	[01:31]	<cwmoser>	"Feisty Fawn - how do you ""Upgrade"" rather than overwrite my existing Ubuntu 6.10??"
[neutral]	[01:31]	<darnell>	with sending mail?
[negative]	[01:31]	<ajehuk>	iain - oh right - sorry, so all you are after is a restart of the sound system after hibernate... /etc/init.d/alsa reload should do that...
[neutral]	[01:31]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, right
[negative]	[01:31]	<randomwalker>	lando__: but other than that i dunno
[neutral]	[01:31]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, it should be the same as the old one except for the device name
[negative]	[01:31]	<zach>	hey can someone give me a hand with my sound in 7.04?
[positive]	[01:31]	<darnell>	interesting, since its an email proggy
[negative]	[01:31]	<iain>	ajehuk> I'm not sure th ere's anything 'missing' per say.
[neutral]	[01:31]	<LiENUS>	what package do i need under ubuntu to compile znc with openssl support?
[negative]	[01:31]	<vik>	if I want to get an image (using dd) of an LVM volume, which device should I use?
[negative]	[01:31]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, im trying to figure out what all the options mean and the two nubmers at the end
[positive]	[01:31]	<Gigi>	"idefixx I have the beryl manager, I can see ""Beryl Setting Manager""  but I open it and I can change configs, but I do not see the difference and neither the icon"
[negative]	[01:32]	<yigal>	cwmoser: just make another partitition and install Fiesty on it
[negative]	[01:32]	<jeef>	i had two soundcards on this machine and now i'm trying to use a specific one of them... (both are still available it seems).. how can i change which soundcard is primary?
[negative]	[01:32]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, there is no old one... everything was on a single partition
[positive]	[01:32]	<idefixx>	Gigi: Setting Manager and Beryl Manager are two differnet things
[negative]	[01:32]	<randomwalker>	lando__: there seems to be a backup file called /etc/group-
[negative]	[01:32]	<Gigi>	oh...
[negative]	[01:32]	<Beastage>	who can help me? I want to make that the BOOT LOADER will default to Windows
[positive]	[01:32]	<wallydalla1>	tom the geek,  have  you downloaded the ubuntu server cd and run the install?  this is my plan as currently I have risk with just one hd.  I have two 80gig IDE drives and I plan to re-install from the server CD
[negative]	[01:32]	<iain>	ajehuk> nope  'command not found'
[negative]	[01:32]	<TomTheGeek>	i've tried partitioning the disks maunally but it always says it can't find the raid partitions
[negative]	[01:32]	<IncredibleHink>	whats the pastebin url again?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<IncredibleHink>	!pastebin
[neutral]	[01:32]	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[negative]	[01:32]	<nibsa1242b>	*wonders* why do all these people seem to install to a single partition?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<yigal>	Beastage: just have windows as the first option
[negative]	[01:32]	<iain>	ajehuk> i tried /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart before
[negative]	[01:32]	<TomTheGeek>	"i""ve tried using the alternate install cd"
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Beastage>	woha yigal
[negative]	[01:33]	<errorlevel>	nibsa1242b: Why not?
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Gigi>	idefixx I will do the one that you told me then
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Beastage>	my real name is yigal
[negative]	[01:33]	<DanZ3>	"hello. I just burned the feisty cd and when i press ""install"" or ""check cd for defects"", I get a ""/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off""  message. Is this a problem with the cd or my computer?"
[negative]	[01:33]	<ajehuk>	iain - sorry should be 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa restart'
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Beastage>	lol!
[positive]	[01:33]	<yigal>	Beastage: nice :)
[positive]	[01:33]	<eck>	underwatercow: I think if you keep /var clean you probably won't go above 6 GB or so for / (not including /home), even if you have lots of packaged and development headers and whatnot
[neutral]	[01:33]	<iain>	ajehuk> and it returned 'Stopping alsa...... [ok]  starting alsa ..... [ok] ' but didn't fix the sound bug.
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Beastage>	yigal... pm
[negative]	[01:33]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, here is what my original fstab looks like @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:33]	<eck>	underwatercow: then you have to add some space in that to prevent fragmentation and so forth
[negative]	[01:33]	<wallydalla1>	tomthegeek,   it took me work to find it, but the 6.06 server cd is the one you want to find.  i will look for the URL.
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the second to last one is for dump and the last one is for fsck
[negative]	[01:33]	<dredhammer>	hello does anyone know how i get Feisty to recognize the linksys usb wireless adapter?
[negative]	[01:33]	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  I see a red diamond there
[negative]	[01:33]	<lando__>	yes theres a backup how do i run nautilus as root i 4got the command
[neutral]	[01:33]	<lando__>	gtksudo or sumthing
[negative]	[01:34]	<iain>	ajehuk> the problem is that there's no such command (the alsa part)
[neutral]	[01:34]	<idefixx>	Gigi: right click on it - go to Select Windows Man. and chose Beryl
[negative]	[01:34]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the last one tells fsck whether to check the partition if there was a bad shutdown etc.
[neutral]	[01:34]	<randomwalker>	lando__: gksudo nautilus?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<underwatercow>	eck: is there a defragmenter in linux then?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<atlantia>	!nvidia
[neutral]	[01:34]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[negative]	[01:34]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the last one can be left as 0
[neutral]	[01:34]	<Beastage>	is there a point to install official ati drivers?
[negative]	[01:34]	<idefixx>	Gigi: if you dont want to use it anymore switch back to Metacity
[negative]	[01:34]	<lando__>	aww crap
[negative]	[01:34]	<lando__>	it says to contact admin :(
[negative]	[01:34]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, and ummm the last one is up to you...I would say set it to 1
[negative]	[01:34]	<yigal>	dredhammer: what does lsusb give you?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<Veronica-Bot>	server tecate.metachat.net
[neutral]	[01:34]	<lando__>	am i screwd?
[negative]	[01:35]	<nibsa1242b>	errorlevel its always good to at least have a seperate /home partition so that you don't loose your data if something terrible happens and you have to reinstall... plus it makes it easier to backup.  I prefer having /home /usr /boot /root and /var at a min
[positive]	[01:35]	<Gigi>	ok. it is done idefixx now I think that I have a small mess :P  I will keep on my own.  Thanks a lot man!!!!
[negative]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	"ok i am getting miffed. Is there a ""how to unscrew-up and remove nvidia-drivers-issues-caused by once previously recommended scripts (envy) and use the new method which may not work???"
[neutral]	[01:35]	<idefixx>	Gigi: have fun!
[negative]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: use the other person's nick while replying
[neutral]	[01:35]	<nibsa1242b>	errorlevel and also the swap but thats just me
[neutral]	[01:35]	<ajehuk>	iain can you drop the output of sudo  modprobe -l | grep alsa* into a pastebin?
[negative]	[01:35]	<arooni>	what happens when i upgrade... do all my program files/docs stay Safe?
[negative]	[01:35]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, do i want suid or dev?
[positive]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	cause right now, i have been back and forth between envy and this new great rstricted modules interface, and neither works now
[negative]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: yeah, looks like you're screwed
[negative]	[01:35]	<nibsa1242b>	atlantia loot at the script and manually undo what it does
[negative]	[01:35]	<eck>	"underwatercow: no. at least for ext3, if you ever accidentally fill up the filesystem and want to defragment, you could run a script to move (well copy and then delete) files aroudn, since that will ""unfragment"" the files"
[neutral]	[01:35]	<underwatercow>	does linux have a defragmenter?
[neutral]	[01:35]	<underwatercow>	lol
[negative]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	i cant get a shred of consistency to save my arse
[positive]	[01:35]	<randomwalker>	lando__: you can boot from the installer cd again and edit it
[positive]	[01:35]	<atlantia>	pardon my french
[neutral]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: suid
[negative]	[01:36]	<wallydalla1>	nibsa1242b,  i wonder why the automatic ubuntu installer does not create a seperate partition for home folders?
[neutral]	[01:36]	<underwatercow>	eck: interesting
[negative]	[01:36]	<lando__>	randomwalker: good idea
[neutral]	[01:36]	<lando__>	be right back
[neutral]	[01:36]	<tiglionabbit>	hello
[negative]	[01:36]	<atlantia>	so yeah, it downloads and installs the nvidia automagic script
[negative]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: I could have shown you the other stuff
[positive]	[01:36]	<iain>	ajehuk> I'm sure i can (i've done similar before)....but I'm not what the URL is to post it up at ;)
[negative]	[01:36]	<effie_jayx>	"Beastage,  which do you mean... ""ati"" or ""radeon"" ??"
[positive]	[01:36]	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: thanks for both of your help
[negative]	[01:36]	<eck>	underwatercow: i have read some talk about making it easier to defragment ext4, but if you are experiencing fragmentation it's usually becauseyou did something wrong in the first place
[neutral]	[01:36]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: uid is important
[positive]	[01:36]	<jeef>	how can i swap which soundcard is my primary soundcard?
[negative]	[01:36]	<Gigi>	"idefixx Microsoft says ""Wow"" and they only have that weird thing... baryl must be wow x 1000"
[negative]	[01:36]	<tiglionabbit>	there's far too much traffic here.  Is there a more low-key ubuntu channel around?
[neutral]	[01:36]	<Beastage>	effie_jayx:  ATI Radeon drivers...
[neutral]	[01:36]	<ajehuk>	iain - @HLINK will do
[positive]	[01:36]	<dredhammer>	yigal it lists both the linksys adapter and the mouse
[positive]	[01:36]	<nibsa1242b>	wallydallal afaik its a hotly debated topic about how to properly partition and I believe bug reports have been submitted about that behavior
[neutral]	[01:36]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, @HLINK
[negative]	[01:37]	<Beastage>	effie_jayx: I assume that those that bundeled with ubuntu are good enuff
[negative]	[01:37]	<dredhammer>	but i can't get it configured for use
[neutral]	[01:37]	<ajehuk>	!pastebin | iain

[positive]	[01:37]	<idefixx>	Gigi: its fun to play with. and good for impressing ppl ;)
[negative]	[01:37]	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I like 3d stuff :S
[neutral]	[01:37]	<tiglionabbit>	Alonea: that all?
[negative]	[01:37]	<yigal>	dredhammer: so you want wifi with linksys
[negative]	[01:37]	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, thats what gets me confused.... i see the tutorials and they say this, /dev/hda7 /home ext3 nodev,nosuid 0 2, but i dont want to do something because someone told me to, i want to understand it, you know what i mean
[negative]	[01:37]	<yigal>	dredhammer: what card is it using?
[neutral]	[01:37]	<underwatercow>	eck: actually. One last question... which would you recommend? ext3 or Reiserfs?
[positive]	[01:37]	<iain>	ajehuk> yeh i know what it is ;) just not where :-D thanks
[neutral]	[01:37]	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I am having a hard time with catching up with the crowd
[positive]	[01:38]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, for those options @HLINK
[negative]	[01:38]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, you just list them like a list
[positive]	[01:38]	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: of course, uid is good because if names change or strange things happen uid will always allow the computer to id the partition
[positive]	[01:38]	<Alonea>	tiglionabbit: for ubuntu specific channels yeah. I also goto ##linux for help which is usually slow, though sometimes gets a rush
[neutral]	[01:38]	<tiglionabbit>	anyways, I was gonna ask--   Today, I checked my update manager and noticed the distro upgrade button.  Well I decided to upgrade everything on this distro before dist-upgrading, and that happened to include an upgrade for the update manager.  But...   now the update manager doesn't show a dist upgrade button anymore
[negative]	[01:38]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, decide on the ones you want
[negative]	[01:38]	<dunstabulos_>	i have installed samba and swat, what do i need to do to get it working ?
[negative]	[01:38]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, make sure they apply to ext3 though
[negative]	[01:38]	<ajehuk>	iain - thought there was a link in that info - nevermind - as I said @HLINK is my preffered one...
[neutral]	[01:38]	<Beastage>	effie_jayx: yea its busy here
[neutral]	[01:38]	<iain>	ajehuk>@HLINK
[negative]	[01:39]	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I mean with the latest 3d trends
[negative]	[01:39]	<iain>	ajehuk> lol yeh there was. was be being silly not noticing it
[neutral]	[01:39]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, scroll down to -o
[positive]	[01:39]	<effie_jayx>	:D
[neutral]	[01:39]	<dredhammer>	yigal wusb54gv2 wireless usb adapter
[neutral]	[01:39]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the options are there
[negative]	[01:39]	<ajehuk>	iain - OK can you add the output of 'sudo lsmod' to that pastebin...
[negative]	[01:39]	<nibsa1242b>	If I have a failed 64 bit edgy-> fiesty upgrade and I toast all the 64 data but keep my /home and install 32 bit fiesty will things go smoothly or will things in my /home not work correctly?
[neutral]	[01:39]	<yigal>	dredhammer: wusb54gv2 I got one of these up before - I think?
[neutral]	[01:40]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, thx
[negative]	[01:40]	<Gigi>	Everything that I change it is working but the cube hahaha
[neutral]	[01:40]	<dredhammer>	so what are the steps?
[neutral]	[01:40]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	hey
[negative]	[01:40]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	I got a serious problem
[negative]	[01:40]	<dredhammer>	without a net connection getting ndiswrapper could be a problem
[positive]	[01:41]	<idefixx>	Gigi: press ctrl+alt+left-click (on desktop) and move the mouse.
[positive]	[01:41]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	my top and bottom bars disappear after switching desktop spaces
[positive]	[01:41]	<iain>	ajehuk> done :)
[negative]	[01:41]	<yigal>	dredhammer: do you have any drivers - if I recall correctly this is the route I took
[positive]	[01:41]	<ajehuk>	iain - and the output of 'sudo lspci' as well..
[neutral]	[01:41]	<yigal>	dredhammer: ndiswrappers
[neutral]	[01:41]	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  Thanks!
[negative]	[01:41]	<RealistR>	hi.. running beryl on fesity... when I login.. there is no window decorator run.. just the beryl windows ... no titlebars... how can i get it to run?
[neutral]	[01:42]	<xjkx>	does ubuntu come with any cd burner by default?
[neutral]	[01:42]	<jbettcher>	RealistR:  you have to add beryl-manager to your startup programs under the session settings
[neutral]	[01:42]	<Supaplex>	xjkx: there'd k3b
[neutral]	[01:42]	<wallydalla1>	xjkx,  serpentine comes w ubuntu
[negative]	[01:42]	<RealistR>	hi.. running beryl on fesity... when I login.. there is no window decorator run.. just the beryl windows ... no titlebars... how can i get it to run?  run on login that is.. if I run beryl-manager from the xterm its fine.. just not running whne logging back in to gdm
[neutral]	[01:42]	<RealistR>	jbettcher:  how
[neutral]	[01:42]	<dredhammer>	well no drivers saved to anything
[neutral]	[01:42]	<wallydalla1>	xjkx: test message
[neutral]	[01:42]	<Gigi>	idefixx and how do a put a wallpaper on the black ones?
[positive]	[01:42]	<Morris_The_Cat>	Hi everyone... i just upgraded to Feisty which impressed me, but my internal master and slave disks were named sda and sdb by Feisty...why?
[negative]	[01:42]	<underwatercow>	is Reiserfs better than ext3? It seems like ext3 is preferred
[neutral]	[01:42]	<jbettcher>	RealistR: under your preferences then sessions
[neutral]	[01:42]	<Xamusk>	hi
[negative]	[01:42]	<xjkx>	Supaplex, k3b needs kdelibs, i would like ti cut it off, wallydalla1 is serpentine gtk based?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<dredhammer>	is it on the feisty disc by default?
[positive]	[01:43]	<sanityx>	With the alternate cd, what exactley does it install when you install a command line system?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<RealistR>	"under ""startup programs"" or under session options?"
[negative]	[01:43]	<idefixx>	Gigi: u thats called skydome dont know where it is anymore... just play around with the options there is a LOT of stuff in there.
[positive]	[01:43]	<Xamusk>	does anyone knows where does gnome store it's xmodmaps?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<strick1>	Anyone know how to partiion and format an HFS+ (Apple format) USB drive on Ubuntu ?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<Gigi>	"xjkx yes.  When you insert the CD it will prompt you to burn.  For an iso, right click and ""Write to disk"""
[negative]	[01:43]	<Supaplex>	xjkx: I don't know.  there's wodim, but that's all commandline based.
[negative]	[01:43]	<yigal>	dredhammer: I'm sorry I did it a year ago and I think it was with v1 not v2 so I am going to have to tell you I can't help much
[positive]	[01:43]	<iain>	ajehuk> there you go :)
[neutral]	[01:43]	<Gigi>	OK.  idefixx Thanks pal!
[neutral]	[01:43]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one both bars disappear.
[negative]	[01:44]	<nibsa1242b>	or alternatively is there anyway to rescue a failed edgy -> fiesty upgrade I think one of the packages I dled was corrupted and it hard locks when I chroot into my root and do a dpkg --configure -a I have a seg fault from one of the font packages and some other problems... is there anyway to tell dpkg to undo all of the Fiesty upgrade so I can redo it?
[neutral]	[01:44]	<ajehuk>	iain - ta
[negative]	[01:44]	<xjkx>	what about audio burning, does ubuntu come with any by default?
[negative]	[01:44]	<wallydalla1>	xjkx: i don't know the api.  i just know that if you do a clean install of ubuntu 6.06 you get serpentine cd burner for music
[neutral]	[01:44]	<xjkx>	uhmm
[negative]	[01:44]	<wallydalla1>	xjkx:  btw it will only burn a cd from OGG files as far as I know.
[negative]	[01:44]	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, and no kde right?
[positive]	[01:44]	<Morris_The_Cat>	Hi everyone... i just upgraded to Feisty which impressed me, but my internal master and slave disks were named sda and sdb by Feisty...why?

[neutral]	[01:45]	<strick1>	Anyone know how to partiion and format an HFS+ (Apple format) USB drive on Ubuntu ?
[negative]	[01:45]	<nibsa1242b>	Morris_The_Cat I can't tell you why, but I know its common and many people have reported that.
[neutral]	[01:45]	<wallydalla1>	kde is the GUI for Kubuntu.     Ubuntu has Gnome as the desktopmanager  i think.  i'm new
[negative]	[01:45]	<Supaplex>	Morris_The_Cat: what were you using before? serial ata drives are now sdX
[negative]	[01:45]	<Hor|zon>	you should be using ogg anyways
[negative]	[01:45]	<razzorz>	i d/l the 7.4 iso how do i load it from the disk?..
[neutral]	[01:45]	<Hor|zon>	it's better than mp3 by a long shot
[positive]	[01:45]	<Gigi>	This darn thing is crazy but nice.  I work a lot with the computer writing reports and doing investments.  This stuff will make it funnier :)  I have Linux Ubuntu since 2 years and I even remember what are blue dead screens and erros
[neutral]	[01:45]	<nibsa1242b>	Supaplex I thought sata drives were always sdx or at least mine were
[neutral]	[01:45]	<dredhammer>	well thats  a bummer
[negative]	[01:45]	<tiglionabbit>	how do I upgrade to feisty from edgy?  The button isn't there
[neutral]	[01:45]	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, i know whats kde, i would just like to know if it comes by deafault, maybe bringing some qt libs
[negative]	[01:46]	<Morris_The_Cat>	yesterday they were hda and hdb...after the installation they just changed to sda and sdb
[neutral]	[01:46]	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, try calling it there
[neutral]	[01:46]	<randomwalker>	i got a vexing question
[negative]	[01:46]	<Morris_The_Cat>	i'm afraid something could happen to my files
[neutral]	[01:46]	<AnRkey>	I am trying to share a folder using SMB but i get this >> 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled
[negative]	[01:46]	<wallydalla1>	pardon my ignornace but why is OGG better than MP3?    i don't think OGG is supported by many devices
[negative]	[01:46]	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
[negative]	[01:46]	<randomwalker>	how do you pronouce sudo?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<Morris_The_Cat>	i made a backup though
[negative]	[01:46]	<ajehuk>	iain - can you try doing a 'sudo modprobe -i snd-hda-intel' and then restarting alsa.. and see what happens
[neutral]	[01:46]	<Xamusk>	    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), same_screen YES,
[negative]	[01:46]	<Xamusk>	I want to bind this keycode to backslash bar

[neutral]	[01:46]	<Hor|zon>	wallydalla1, you can install kde in normal ubuntu, just apt get the kde-desktop package and at login you can choose kde
[neutral]	[01:46]	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, ogg is a free format

[positive]	[01:46]	<Supaplex>	nibsa1242b: there's recent kernel changes in 2.6 to move all sata and pata drivers into their own subclass.  A few drivers provide both, and didn't map drives like they should have.

[neutral]	[01:47]	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 I believe you get better quality at a lower bitrate with ogg
[negative]	[01:47]	<wallydalla1>	mp3 does not cost anything to use does it?
[neutral]	[01:47]	<Hor|zon>	it's not free
[positive]	[01:47]	<AnRkey>	wallydalla1, no i use it and it never charges me :D
[negative]	[01:47]	<Morris_The_Cat>	ok ok thanx a lot...i'm breathing calmly now
[positive]	[01:47]	<Morris_The_Cat>	:)
[negative]	[01:47]	<Hor|zon>	well there used to be royalties it might be free now
[negative]	[01:47]	<wallydalla1>	but in 20 years will anything play OGG files?    I bet in 20 years you can still play MP3 files
[negative]	[01:47]	<Hor|zon>	I think I heard the patent expired?

[neutral]	[01:48]	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, it supports mp3 @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:48]	<iain>	ajehuk> not a lot.
[negative]	[01:48]	<Hor|zon>	wallydalla1 well since ogg is completely open it's more likely ogg will be around...

[negative]	[01:48]	<Xamusk>	unfortunately, it looks like ogg has problems playing in embedded devices, because it uses floating points
[negative]	[01:49]	<AnRkey>	forQed, there's a linux client? where?
[neutral]	[01:49]	<Hor|zon>	not really
[negative]	[01:49]	<idefixx>	randomwalker: afaik rfs4 didnt make it to feisty... not sure tough
[positive]	[01:49]	<Hor|zon>	I made sure all my players supported ogg
[positive]	[01:49]	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 I imagine the opposite will be ture; think about today can you still play old windows games in XP or VISTA... no most of the time you can't but you can in linux under WINE... ogg is an open format and the knowledge to be able to read and use it will still be there 20 years from now it may or may not be for mp3
[positive]	[01:49]	<forQed>	AnRkey, it is on their webpage, listed as alpha

[neutral]	[01:50]	<wallydalla1>	yikes   $600 for a music player.
[negative]	[01:50]	<ajehuk>	iain - OK situation is - drivers for the sound system are in, all relevant applications doing what they should but no sound.  the card isnt coming out of hibernate... 2 suggestions first, would be to log out and back in and see if it makes any difference (it wont) 2 report the bug with the hibernate people .  I would suggest there is a 50% chance of it being an issue with suspend and 50% problem with the driver..
[negative]	[01:50]	<AnRkey>	forQed, never tried Second Life. what's it like?
[neutral]	[01:50]	<randomwalker>	wallydalla1, in the future ogg support will probably get better but at present it's crap
[neutral]	[01:51]	<LoneShadow>	do people still have to edit configure files by hand ?
[negative]	[01:51]	<nibsa1242b>	I still need an anwser to if installing 32 bit fiesty on a system that used to have 64 bit edgy will mess anything up if I keep my /home but get rid of everything else.

[negative]	[01:51]	<iain>	ajehuk> cool. Thanks bro. Logging out doesn't work. I've tried just restarting X which requires that....
[positive]	[01:51]	<iain>	ajehuk> rebooting the comp does ergo my setup is usually fine.
[negative]	[01:51]	<adaptr>	ExpositionOfEvil: that's ebcause beryl doesn't care about your desktop settings - use the manager
[positive]	[01:51]	<LoneShadow>	I was under the impression, feisty was meant to invite people who dont want to mess with config files :)
[negative]	[01:51]	<iain>	ajehuk> so it looks like there's a bug somewhere
[negative]	[01:51]	<ajehuk>	iain - looks like the hardware state after coming out of suspend isnt 100% -

[negative]	[01:52]	<iain>	ajehuk> where do I bugrep?
[neutral]	[01:52]	<LoneShadow>	There are lot of frontends for all configs, I hope they are packaged by default with feisty
[neutral]	[01:52]	<AnRkey>	forQed, i laughed when i saw that people buy virtual property and stuff
[positive]	[01:52]	<nibsa1242b>	ajehuk thanks, I didn't think it would but edgy-> fiesty upgrade already messed up so much and I didn't relish doing a fresh install of fiesty and having to deal with all the custom config to get 64 to work as well as 32 does out of the box

[negative]	[01:54]	<ajehuk>	iain - interesting test would be to turn off the sound system - hibernate - start up again and enable it see if the problem is still there (it should be if its hardware but as I said it'd be interesting) as to bug reporting Im not sure who would be best to report to but I asume you'd go through the ubuntu but @HLINK looks like an option - either that or take alook at the man page for hibernate / suspend to s

[neutral]	[02:08]	<asdfasdf>	wallydalla1 ive had luck with easyubuntu
[negative]	[02:08]	<pavan>	hi! I am trying to install netbeans but it says it requires java 1.5 but instead is finding 1.4 version.. 1.4 is installed, so how do I change the path?
[neutral]	[02:08]	<Fylk>	ajehuk, help?
[negative]	[02:08]	<nibsa1242b>	asdfasdf I think its a tad more complicated then that you have to make the flash drive bootable or something and you might even need a special iso I don't remember I'm still looking so I don't want to say something incorrect
[neutral]	[02:08]	<wallydalla1>	what is easyubuntu?   is that like automatix
[neutral]	[02:08]	<stefg>	wallydalla1: getting a proper sources.list and using apt is cleaner and quicker
[neutral]	[02:08]	<Ax4>	pavan, sudo nano -w /etc/profile
[neutral]	[02:08]	<asdfasdf>	yea
[positive]	[02:08]	<spikeb>	wallydalla1: yes, only it doesn't suck as much.
[neutral]	[02:08]	<Ax4>	pavan, add your new path in there
[negative]	[02:08]	<LjL>	wallydalla1: why not just install them with the tool that's been provided since forever - APT? google earth is available from the medibuntu repository, same (i think) for real player, java is available in the official repositories
[negative]	[02:09]	<wallydalla1>	ok, sucks less.  good.   i will google that now
[negative]	[02:09]	<badkitty>	Automatix broke my system bad and I lost lots of time (especially cause I had beryl working after many issues)

[negative]	[02:09]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects and set a firefox window to fullscreen I cant close it
[negative]	[02:09]	<wallydalla1>	yes. automatix broke a test system for me once.   post automatix i could not use APT-GET
[negative]	[02:09]	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 and installing stuff without a proper source list can make it difficult when you upgrade from your current version of ubuntu

[neutral]	[02:39]	<NobleCommerc1>	hey, anyone know why x says my refresh is 50hz when my xorg.conf specifies 60? Its a tv.
[neutral]	[02:39]	<debaser>	is there a way to resume a broken upgrade?
[positive]	[02:40]	<Ax4>	VividHazE, wait your turn, got other people with questions lol, this is turning into a job! :p
[positive]	[02:40]	<VividHazE>	:)
[negative]	[02:40]	<zipped20x>	is there a website or some place i could go to download updates for my computer one at a time?
[negative]	[02:40]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, describe exactly what happened after you clicked install. just a blank window?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<debaser>	NobleComm, use /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[positive]	[02:40]	<nuked_omen>	debaser: when my upgrade gets broken, it resumes automatically when i start it again
[negative]	[02:40]	<obsethryl>	excuse me for repeating the request, are there any known issues in the lvm setup using the alternative cd install? I have a rather huge lvm + raid storage set here i want to plug in during installation; current google search gives nothing but i want to avoid mistakes, thanks
[positive]	[02:40]	<Ax4>	zipped20x, yes, im finding it for you, sec :)
[neutral]	[02:40]	<zipped20x>	kool
[positive]	[02:40]	<zipped20x>	thanks
[positive]	[02:40]	<TirEoghain>	Impaque : Done, thanks for the info : @HLINK
[negative]	[02:40]	<stp2007>	randomwalker, lots of disk access and eventually a blank window. To be honest I can't remember because I was doing other things as well. I just rebooted and will try to reinstall again.
[negative]	[02:41]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: did you do sudo exportfs -ra afterwards?
[neutral]	[02:41]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, if you have 256 megs
[neutral]	[02:41]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: (reloads /etc/exports)
[neutral]	[02:41]	<VividHazE>	on the client or the server impaque
[positive]	[02:41]	<VividHazE>	both?
[positive]	[02:41]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, you don't have enough memory to install and do lots of other things at the same time
[negative]	[02:41]	<debaser>	actually I can't start it again
[negative]	[02:41]	<rookiehwm>	my keyboard shortcut isn't working :( alt-f2 is still opening the gnome terminal, not aterm
[neutral]	[02:41]	<rookiehwm>	anyone know how to fix this?
[negative]	[02:41]	<debaser>	I can't boot
[negative]	[02:41]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, so try not opening other programs other than the installer
[positive]	[02:41]	<stp2007>	randomwalker, I was doing the other stuff on my other laptop :)
[negative]	[02:41]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, oh. then try to see how much memory it's using
[neutral]	[02:41]	<ajehuk>	Kazol - back to your raid issue -
[negative]	[02:42]	<Kazol>	ajehuk: ok
[negative]	[02:42]	<stp2007>	randomwalker, how can I determine that?
[negative]	[02:42]	<ajehuk>	Kazol - does this machine have any other OS's installed?
[positive]	[02:42]	<Winkerbean>	For anyone interested, my fstab is found at @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:42]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, system->administratin->system monitor
[negative]	[02:42]	<Kazol>	No, I just have 2x10GB, I don't care if I format them
[neutral]	[02:42]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: server
[negative]	[02:42]	<TirEoghain>	that paste service is a damn good idea, how long do the entries stay live for?
[negative]	[02:43]	<stp2007>	randomwalker, ok will give that a try when able to. Might be a bit because I really didn't have mouse control (slow. etc)
[negative]	[02:43]	<foxhound>	Hi,I have an asus wl-167g wireless USB adapter and I would like to know if it is going to be recognised by ubuntu,or if I have to make some configurations
[negative]	[02:43]	<randomwalker>	stp2007, yeah, sounds bad, probably best just reboot
[negative]	[02:43]	<Ax4>	god my gf is crazy
[negative]	[02:43]	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: you're mounting an empty dvd-rw ?
[negative]	[02:43]	<Ax4>	she's nuts i swear
[negative]	[02:43]	<nuked_omen>	debaser: so you started an upgrade and it broke your system and now you want to somehow upgrade without booting?
[negative]	[02:43]	<nuked_omen>	Ax4: take this to -offtopic please
[neutral]	[02:43]	<riggatone`>	how to get dell wireless to work?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<Winkerbean>	Impaque, yes.
[negative]	[02:44]	<VividHazE>	whats the address of that pastebin thing impaque, I want to show you the output I get from that command I don't understand it
[positive]	[02:44]	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: ...umm, why? ;) you can't mount an empty dvd-rw
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Ax4>	nuked_omen, chill im helping others, didn't quite qualify as a rant

[neutral]	[02:44]	<nuked_omen>	!pastebin | VividHazE
[neutral]	[02:44]	<ubotu>	VividHazE: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[positive]	[02:44]	<Winkerbean>	Impaque, perhaps this highlights my ignorance.  How would one open a dvd to use similar to a floppy?  (Maybe *this* highlights my age.)
[positive]	[02:45]	<debaser>	nuked_omen: I still have the shipped 5.10 liveCD so I can mount /root
[negative]	[02:45]	<nuked_omen>	Ax4: i don't see how telling someone about your girlfriend can help him
[negative]	[02:45]	<randomc0de>	so I installed the msttcorefonts recently because the mythtv package requires them, but now Firefox looks horrible... is there any way I can get the old fonts back without remove the msttcorefonts package? I tried just renaming the directories they installed to
[neutral]	[02:45]	<debaser>	I just needed to know if it was possible

[neutral]	[02:45]	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: by using programs like k3b in KDE or it's equivalent in gnome. nero-like
[negative]	[02:45]	<debaser>	I guess a chroot should work
[positive]	[02:45]	<VR_>	"whenever i play an .avi file in totem, my whole system freezes. i do have ""Ubuntu restricted extras"" installed as well as w32codecs. am i missing something?"
[positive]	[02:46]	<TirEoghain>	I also see a headline that the new beta of Nero for Linux is out as well Winkerbean
[negative]	[02:46]	<randomwalker>	is there a way to sort the output of the /list command by number of users or something? i get this massive output that i can't make sense of
[negative]	[02:46]	<Kazol>	I already tried all RAID approaches, it did not work. I asked on forums, IRC, etc., no one could solve my problem
[positive]	[02:46]	<Ax4>	i think it did help him, shhh!
[negative]	[02:46]	<VividHazE>	impaque i got your name wrong there, i just posted the pastebin thing, in case you didn't notice it @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:46]	<Impaque>	"Winkerbean: (afaik, it still can't work as in WinXP f.e., to open it, drag & drop some files and just select ""burn"" from a menu)"

[negative]	[02:46]	<xtknight>	how do i remove a raid0 array for good?  it's not as easy as it sounds.....
[negative]	[02:46]	<Ax4>	ok zipped20x : @HLINK <--- try this
[negative]	[02:46]	<DARKGuy>	like, to make a video of an app or my desktop
[neutral]	[02:46]	<debaser>	*BASH REDIRECTION
[negative]	[02:46]	<nuked_omen>	debaser: why not plug your harddrive as a slave in another computer and take whatever you want, or you can boot a live cd and get all your data on dvds or an external hard drive
[neutral]	[02:46]	<zipped20x>	brb
[positive]	[02:46]	<Winkerbean>	Impaque: Oh. Whoops. :-[  Thanks.

[neutral]	[02:48]	<debaser>	that possibility
[neutral]	[02:48]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: try quoting
[neutral]	[02:48]	<Kazol>	What is your opinion? I have a 800Mhz 256MB 2x10GB webserver; how many connections\bandwidth will it hadle before saturation?

[negative]	[02:49]	<DARKGuy>	if anybody knows, they'll reply

[negative]	[02:50]	<TirEoghain>	Impaque, I am looking through this log again, and the ATI driver seems to load fine, could that be possible, there is no (EE) type messages around where I think it loads the fglrx module

[positive]	[02:50]	<wallydalla1>	mistaWAC:   you might buy a linksys box to use while you debug your ubuntu box.  this will keep you sane.
[negative]	[02:50]	<Impaque>	TirEoghain: (or what's the name again, i'm not using that driver..)
[negative]	[02:51]	<NobleCommerc1>	the tv out is working, looks great... i just want to make sure the refresh is 60hz
[negative]	[02:51]	<debaser>	NobleComm: or you're using another configuration file, or another log file, or you didn't check with enough precission, that's all I can tell you, but could be perfectly something else.
[negative]	[02:51]	<randomc0de>	is there a way I can force Firefox to use the non-msttcore fonts without removing the package?

[negative]	[02:51]	<TirEoghain>	so i guess that means yes?
[neutral]	[02:51]	<eck>	randomc0de: you can change the default font, but many web pages will specify the font to use for the page by font name (e.g. Arial)
[negative]	[02:51]	<boss>	For kickstart configuration of Ubuntu, if I specify a postinstallation script with %post, am I by default in a chroot?
[negative]	[02:51]	<debaser>	I don't know how you can do it, but I've had that problem and checking in monitorworld and setting up things correctly was the solution
[negative]	[02:51]	<mistaWAC>	Wally, lol...sanity isn't a problem..I am fairly patient and if a basic idea is given on how to do this, I can probably manage to figure it out
[negative]	[02:51]	<NobleCommerc1>	well i'm sure i'm using xorg.conf, cause i just set the tv out settings in it and tv out began working
[negative]	[02:52]	<boss>	If so, does %post --nochroot work in Ubuntu?

[negative]	[02:56]	<TirEoghain>	Impaque, thanks for the help! I have nothing on this Ubuntu install, so might just reformat and go back to the free driver

[neutral]	[02:56]	<wallydalla1>	peeps:   have you ever gotten your USB drive to boot >
[neutral]	[02:57]	<eck>	mistaWAC: vpnc is a client only
[neutral]	[02:57]	<peeps>	wallydalla1, no i just got it
[neutral]	[02:57]	<mistaWAC>	grr...I thought so
[negative]	[02:57]	<mistaWAC>	but a bunch o people said it was server side too
[positive]	[02:57]	<cabajgtr>	Whats the best way to migrate an install from one hard drive to another when I can't connect them simultaneously ( but I can copy them to 3rd firewire drive )
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, i misunderstood your needs, use pptpd
[negative]	[02:57]	<eck>	mistaWAC: if you want a free vpn server you might fo with openvpn
[positive]	[02:57]	<mistaWAC>	thanks
[neutral]	[02:57]	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  if it is new, you have to install an OS before u can boot
[negative]	[02:57]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: explain more precisely please, the computer is booted from network or the iso is in a network?
[neutral]	[02:57]	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: echo options snd-hda-intel model=lg|sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
[negative]	[02:57]	<mistaWAC>	I thought that was for Linux-Linux connections only though?
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Yahooadam>	debaser - the iso is on a networked computer
[neutral]	[02:57]	<kbidd>	does ubuntu have a firewall enabled by default?
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, edit pptpd's config at /etc/pptpd.conf
[neutral]	[02:58]	<eck>	mistaWAC: no, it is cross platform
[positive]	[02:58]	<Ax4>	once you haev it installed
[neutral]	[02:58]	<Ax4>	have*
[negative]	[02:58]	<randomwalker>	Yahooadam: ssh or samba or something else?
[neutral]	[02:58]	<eck>	mistaWAC: we used to use openvpn at work, had clients on linux/windows/mac
[neutral]	[02:58]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: then you must first mount the partition holding the iso file
[negative]	[02:58]	<mistaWAC>	I had that earlier and couldn't get any Linux-Windows help for it...will try that too
[neutral]	[02:58]	<wallydalla1>	hey,   has anyone out there found a WiFi card that is plug and play with Ubuntu.  I don't want to mess with NDIS or any command line stuff
[positive]	[02:58]	<mistaWAC>	thanks
[neutral]	[02:58]	<Fylk>	Some one help me with: @HLINK
[positive]	[02:58]	<NobleCommerc1>	cabajgtr: boot from cd, copy one drive to the firewire, connect the other drive, boot again from cd, partition the new drive, migrate files?
[positive]	[02:58]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, well you have a few options, pick one of ours and get back to us! lol
[neutral]	[02:59]	<Yahooadam>	randomwalker - its on a windows computer, and i can see the folder in the graphical viewer thing, i just dont know how to get at it from the terminal
[neutral]	[02:59]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: ssh, telnet or rsh work but I think its not the correct solution, you should use smbmount (samba) or NFS
[negative]	[02:59]	<randomc0de>	Fylk: trying to install libdvdcss?
[neutral]	[02:59]	<NobleCommerc1>	cabajgtr: i've never moved an install from one drive to another though, that may not work at all
[positive]	[02:59]	<Ax4>	im sure eck's would work as well, i've only used pptpd
[negative]	[02:59]	<bernarderase>	Anyone have a clever idea how I can get fullscreen video output to a tv (using vlc & nvidia drivers)
[neutral]	[02:59]	<mistaWAC>	so either pptpd or openvpn works?

[negative]	[02:59]	<Fylk>	Random: Yep.
[neutral]	[02:59]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, try one heh
[positive]	[02:59]	<Yahooadam>	debaser - ok - how do i do that :p
[neutral]	[02:59]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: you must mount it
[neutral]	[02:59]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: see the documentation of smbmount
[positive]	[02:59]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, ubuntu is about choice :p
[negative]	[02:59]	<VividHazE>	"debaser, Impaque: OMG! It isn't working yet but its saying more than ""can't recognise what your on about"" message, its saying Permission denied. So...what do I do now? If you have a spare minute :S"
[neutral]	[02:59]	<kbidd>	does ubuntu have a software firewall enabled by default?
[negative]	[02:59]	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  ohhh sorry.       did you set your BIOS to boot from CD as the first device.
[neutral]	[02:59]	<randomc0de>	Fylk: do you have vlc installed?
[negative]	[03:00]	<wizard>	crimsun: do you know if my sound issue has been resolved in feisty on the released version?

[neutral]	[03:00]	<debaser>	anyone?
[negative]	[03:00]	<kbidd>	eck, do you know which firewall it is -- i need to verify its turned off.
[neutral]	[03:00]	<Yahooadam>	so id do 'smbmount *compname* /path/to/mount' ?
[negative]	[03:00]	<[ithaycu] >	Of course I messing around with ffmpeg right now

[neutral]	[03:00]	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: options snd-hda-intel model=lg
[negative]	[03:00]	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  ok,  now,   do you have a CD that you know is good for booting.  aka it will boot from CD in your friend's computer?
[neutral]	[03:00]	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Now what?
[neutral]	[03:01]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: but for example //PC/shared
[neutral]	[03:01]	<debaser>	check the documentation
[negative]	[03:01]	<eck>	kbidd: just run iptables-save and check that there is no output
[negative]	[03:01]	<rogue780|laptop>	can someone point to some kind of tutorial on making a usplash theme?
[neutral]	[03:01]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: For the server or the client? or both?
[negative]	[03:01]	<debaser>	Fylk: I can't boot because of a broken upgrade
[negative]	[03:01]	<Fylk>	Arg, not good.
[neutral]	[03:01]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: server. client can mount using a single line..
[negative]	[03:01]	<debaser>	Fylk: I want to know if I can resume the upgrade booting from a CD.
[negative]	[03:02]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: for client, you don't use /etc/exports at all! you mount using the command-line, or, if you want it permanent, via /etc/fstab
[negative]	[03:02]	<debaser>	Fylk: anyway I can reinstall from scratch after backing up but this is much faster.
[neutral]	[03:02]	<stefg>	!usplash
[negative]	[03:02]	<ubotu>	"To select the usplash artwork you want, use ""sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so && sudo update-initramfs -u"" - See @HLINK for adding your custom artwork"

[neutral]	[03:02]	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: reboot
[negative]	[03:02]	<randomc0de>	Fylk: there's a script for it at /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
[positive]	[03:03]	<rogue780|laptop>	ardchoille, probably, thanks
[negative]	[03:03]	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Don't need to save anything?
[negative]	[03:03]	<ozymandias>	how do i get ubuntu to install kde when I install ubuntu? this whole having to download a giant set of packages and then manually remove gnome thing is sort of retarded
[negative]	[03:03]	<peeps>	wallydalla1, yeah the cd is good
[neutral]	[03:03]	<mistaWAC>	whomever was helping me before...what am I editing after downloading pptpd and openvpn?
[negative]	[03:03]	<Fylk>	Random, how do I run that?
[positive]	[03:03]	<wallydalla1>	ok, well goodnight everyone.   this was an interestng first time.    I wish there was better support for Wireless PCI cards.   Or I wish there was a list of cards that worked 100% PnP.
[neutral]	[03:03]	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: I will have sound afterwards?
[negative]	[03:03]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Ok, silly me :S  Here is my /etc/exports @HLINK

[neutral]	[03:03]	<stefg>	!kubuntu | ozymandias
[positive]	[03:03]	<ubotu>	ozymandias: Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See @HLINK for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[negative]	[03:03]	<debaser>	boss: he's just asking not to do that
[negative]	[03:03]	<xtknight>	how do i rebuild initrd?
[neutral]	[03:03]	<eck>	mistaWAC: with openvpn you will want to read the documentation at openvpn.net, there are a lot of ways to configure your vpn
[neutral]	[03:03]	<debaser>	mkinitrd
[negative]	[03:04]	<mistaWAC>	okay
[negative]	[03:04]	<randomwalker>	debaser: i've never tried this, but try booting from cd, mounting your / directory, removing the cd's /bin and /usr/bin from your $PATH and replacing them with the /bin and /usr/bin on the hosed system, and run apt-get. hopefully it'll be as if you're running on the old system
[neutral]	[03:04]	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: reboot where? Put that on the terminal?
[positive]	[03:04]	<mistaWAC>	thanks a lot
[negative]	[03:04]	<cabajgtr>	Should I be able to Rsync one feisty install over a messed up install to fix it?
[neutral]	[03:04]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: and the IP of the client machine is..?
[negative]	[03:04]	<debaser>	randomwalker: it's better to do a chroot, isn't it?

[positive]	[03:04]	<stefg>	cabajgtr: interesting experiment... let me know of the resukts :-)
[negative]	[03:04]	<randomwalker>	debaser: yeah, good idea
[neutral]	[03:05]	<kbrooks>	So...
[negative]	[03:05]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: and you're trying to mount the first exported dir to no avail?
[negative]	[03:05]	<ozymandias>	"no, seriously. I would like a serious answer to this, not ""download a different distro/iso"" that seems.... like a stupid -non-solution"
[negative]	[03:05]	<debaser>	I guess I'll try
[negative]	[03:05]	<Yahooadam>	SMB connection failed
[negative]	[03:05]	<debaser>	I did it to check logs but I didn't try to run upgrade-manager
[negative]	[03:05]	<Yahooadam>	:S
[neutral]	[03:05]	<kbrooks>	I need sensible answers for a few questions for #ubuntu-trivia
[negative]	[03:05]	<eck>	cabajgtr: there are a few files you would want to not copy over
[neutral]	[03:05]	<eck>	cabajgtr: e.g. ssh keys
[negative]	[03:05]	<cabajgtr>	Well, I tried it, and it still booted into the old install
[neutral]	[03:05]	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, if you installed pptpd, the config will be located in /etc at /etc/pptpd.conf - you can edit it in terminal by running the command 'sudo nano -w /etc/pptpd.conf' or using the GTK text editor by 'sudo gedit /etc/pptpd.conf'
[negative]	[03:05]	<Fylk>	Random: still no good.
[negative]	[03:05]	<hydrozen>	Hi. Just wondering... I just upgraded to feisty from edgy... and when I enable desktop effects (compiz), window decorations don't work. Is there a quick fix for this????

[negative]	[03:06]	<stefg>	ozymandias: err, things are as they are. this is the only answer possible
[negative]	[03:06]	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, what do u wanna do
[neutral]	[03:06]	<debaser>	Yahooadam: check samba services are running and configured correctly (especially wiindows group) and at last check wiring
[negative]	[03:06]	<ozymandias>	apt-get install kde has just taken longer than the install did in the first place

[negative]	[03:07]	<ozymandias>	kbrooks i would like a serious answer on how I can use the install disk I have to install a desktop enviroment like KDE initially, so I dont have to apt-get install kde, and then apt-get remove all teh useless pieces of gnome
[negative]	[03:07]	<yell0w>	hey folks, how do i find out what's running on a port ?
[neutral]	[03:07]	<randomc0de>	anyone having trouble with accessing the repository should find a mirror and change apt to use that, I switched to the easynews mirror and my speeds went up by a factor of 10

[negative]	[03:07]	<eck>	randomwalker: you would have to set firefox to ignore the fonts that sites specify altogether, if a site specifies a MS font in the css then that is the font that firefox will use

[negative]	[03:08]	<stefg>	ozymandias: are you trolling?
[negative]	[03:08]	<ozymandias>	downloading KDE packages during install is acceptable, downloading a second 700 MB iso to do something trivial like this is not
[negative]	[03:08]	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, we are trying to seriously aswer

[negative]	[03:09]	<brunoUT>	yo peeps....i am trying to play the game tremulous...but when the game starts i can not see anything and its all distorted....any ideas?
[positive]	[03:09]	<Nick_Hill>	If I change the kernel boot parameters in /etc/grub/menu.lst, when the kernel updates, the new line doesn't have the parameter. Can I make a change elsewhere so that the update system adds the boot parameter?
[negative]	[03:09]	<eck>	randomc0de: because there are fallback fonts in the css
[negative]	[03:09]	<kbrooks>	stefg, i wonder if he is cooperating at all
[neutral]	[03:09]	<wastrel>	ozymandias:  the ubuntu install disk doesn't contain kde packages.  you need the kubuntu install disk for that.

[positive]	[03:10]	<kbrooks>	brunoUT, dont order me around :-)
[negative]	[03:10]	<brunoUT>	but its all messed up graphically
[neutral]	[03:10]	<southafrikanse>	Is crimsun still here?
[positive]	[03:10]	<ozymandias>	wastrel i have an active net connection during install though, why download a 700meg iso rather than the 10 meg of kde packages? and even if i install it after i install the image, i still haev to deal with gnome being installed, as i was never givien an option during the install to NOT install gnome.
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Fylk>	iirc?
[positive]	[03:10]	<debaser>	Stormx2: a friend has a bass and I could play it (Here Comes your man)

[neutral]	[03:11]	<randomc0de>	eck: the weird part was that I moved the directories to hide the fonts from firefox, and it still used them
[negative]	[03:11]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Am I screwed then, I was hoping to have all my files on the one computer so the other computers and laptops in the house could read it from them :(
[negative]	[03:11]	<ozymandias>	wastrel so where is teh bugzilla to report that to?
[negative]	[03:11]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: the only thing that comes to mind is that the user/group is preventing from mounting
[positive]	[03:11]	<VividHazE>	I thought this network stuff would be easy enough, gah!
[negative]	[03:11]	<NemesisD>	hi guys, when upgrading to feisty, should I use: apt-get dist-upgrade or apt-get upgrade?
[negative]	[03:11]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: you can try doing this:

[negative]	[03:12]	<debaser>	Stormx2: I wish I could say something like that, but I don't know much people interested in rock music because I am a classical guitar player.
[neutral]	[03:12]	<stefg>	!upgrade | NemesisD
[neutral]	[03:12]	<ubotu>	NemesisD: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[positive]	[03:12]	<randomc0de>	Fylk: also, go to File->Open Disc in VLC, and you can find options for DVD (With Menus) and DVD (No Menus)
[neutral]	[03:12]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sec, i'll post the fix on pastebin.. hold on
[positive]	[03:12]	<Ax4>	it's my opinion that a fresh install is always the best

[neutral]	[03:12]	<zipped20x>	so is the reason my update files failing because everyone's updating thier files as well?
[negative]	[03:12]	<Fylk>	Yeah, menus didn't ever open.
[neutral]	[03:12]	<Stormx2>	brunoUT: File a bug.
[neutral]	[03:12]	<yell0w>	Impaque, uhm that doesn't give me any info about which process it is
[negative]	[03:12]	<stefg>	feisty-beginner: have you adapted your /etc/apt/sources.list, so that it point to your local repo?
[negative]	[03:12]	<Fylk>	Wait!! it worked!
[negative]	[03:12]	<Shadow_X>	hey guys I got a question about SYNAPTIC, so u SPM experts listen up
[neutral]	[03:12]	<brunoUT>	ummm...no?
[positive]	[03:12]	<debaser>	Stormx2: but I listen to a lot of music and try to help friends doing a rock band. I hope it works someday, and I wish luck for your project
[negative]	[03:13]	<hydrozen>	Hi. Just wondering... I just upgraded to feisty from edgy... and when I enable desktop effects (compiz), window decorations don't work. Is there a quick fix for this????
[positive]	[03:13]	<Stormx2>	debaser: Ah. I've been playing since christmas... just learning chords and the odd tab... Tis fun ;)
[neutral]	[03:13]	<randomc0de>	/Fylk: give VLC a minute on commercial DVD's too - brute-force cracking that encryption key is tough!
[neutral]	[03:13]	<feisty-beginner>	stefg: yes, in the installer ,I explicitly pointed to my local repository
[neutral]	[03:13]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:13]	<Shadow_X>	please dont ask me to explain the whole reason I need this, but how can I FORCE Synaptic to redownload packages for reinstallation, even if it says it already has them?
[positive]	[03:13]	<Fylk>	I love VLC.
[neutral]	[03:13]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Trying now
[positive]	[03:13]	<debaser>	Stormx2: very good, it's quite a great achievement for that short time.
[neutral]	[03:13]	<brunoUT>	how can i set VLC as my default player for DVDs....when i put a DVD in gay totem always comes up and cant play it
[negative]	[03:14]	<dunstabulos_>	i have installed swat, do i need xinetd to run it?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<Impaque>	yell0w: it does. if you have sshd running, it will show the PID of the process and name (sshd)
[negative]	[03:14]	<sanityx>	Is there a way to mount bin or cue files without burning them
[negative]	[03:14]	<Stormx2>	debaser: You learn quick if you enjoy what you play. What kind of things do you play? I know next to nothing about classical guitar..
[neutral]	[03:14]	<stefg>	!info cdemu
[positive]	[03:14]	<eric>	Shadow_X: Try apt-get clean. That will clear out your cached downloads.

[neutral]	[03:15]	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: Multimedia Tab
[negative]	[03:15]	<stefg>	sanityx: there's a program called cdemu to do that. It's not in the repos, so google for it

[negative]	[03:15]	<witless>	so, am i basically screwed with Desktop Effects until nvidia fixes their driver?
[negative]	[03:15]	<Impaque>	yell0w: you must run as root: sudo netstat -anpt
[neutral]	[03:15]	<debaser>	Stormx2: I'm studying and I'm actually playing studios of Giuliani, Villa-Lobos, Ponce and Brouwer
[negative]	[03:15]	<brunoUT>	randomcode: thanks i just found it
[neutral]	[03:15]	<Stormx2>	Shadow_X: I think you can make apt-get do that.
[positive]	[03:15]	<Stormx2>	Shadow_X: Have a look at the man page
[negative]	[03:15]	<Impaque>	yell0w: are you still not getting the info, even that way?
[neutral]	[03:15]	<sanityx>	i dont like to install non repo stuff
[neutral]	[03:15]	<debaser>	Stormx2: you can listen somethings at sky.fm
[neutral]	[03:16]	<randomc0de>	witless: I've been using the SVN/experimental repository for months now and it works fine, switching to it is a bit of a pain, but not impossible
[neutral]	[03:16]	<stefg>	sanityx: then forget it
[neutral]	[03:16]	<sanityx>	mm
[negative]	[03:16]	<brunoUT>	randomc0de: where is VLC player stored by default?
[negative]	[03:16]	<randomc0de>	witless: command line is pretty much required though
[negative]	[03:16]	<yell0w>	Impaque, ok, i  got it, portmap
[neutral]	[03:16]	<yell0w>	Impaque, now how should i disable portmap ?
[negative]	[03:16]	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: stored? like the executable that you actually run?
[negative]	[03:16]	<alienseer23>	I am looking for help trying to set up lirc, I really don't know what to do, is there a good how to?
[neutral]	[03:16]	<yell0w>	lol

[positive]	[03:16]	<brunoUT>	thanks
[negative]	[03:16]	<witless>	randomc0de: is there some kind of fix to the driver in SVN?
[positive]	[03:16]	<zipped20x>	so nearly ALL of my update files are failing on me
[negative]	[03:17]	<randomc0de>	witless: you're having trouble with the window decorator?
[negative]	[03:17]	<zipped20x>	why is that?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<stefg>	sanityx: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:17]	<randomc0de>	witless: and the nvidia proprietary driver?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<Jump86>	finally got feisty upgrade to work.. time to showoff my desktop: @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:17]	<sanityx>	cool
[neutral]	[03:17]	<Kevin>	hello
[positive]	[03:17]	<debaser>	Stormx2: I don't really enjoy classical music as much as prog rock, but it's fun to play it and I think it's a good step before playing prog rock, space rock or things like that
[negative]	[03:17]	<eck>	zipped20x: how do you mean failing?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<Impaque>	yell0w: sudo /etc/init.d/portmap stop
[negative]	[03:18]	<Kevin>	how do i shutdown x
[negative]	[03:18]	<witless>	randomc0de: actually the biggest problem is that when i switch away from my desktop (eg alt-f1 into terminal) and them come back, i see nothign but a black screen and the mouse pointer (which i can move around)
[negative]	[03:18]	<Impaque>	yell0w: but it will break nfs (if you have some dirs mounted etc.)
[positive]	[03:18]	<Leftmost>	Is there a package with restricted modules that can be compiled for/used with a custom-rolled kernel?
[negative]	[03:18]	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  that is so tight.....how did u get all that?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<randomwalker>	Jump86: is that gdesklets?
[negative]	[03:18]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: That didn't work either, but I found out that if I type the su command and enter my root password it says it won't let me too, is that normal?  When I enter the password for sudo it works ok
[neutral]	[03:18]	<ardchoille>	Kevin: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[negative]	[03:18]	<yell0w>	Impaque, sorry, i mean remove it from booting ?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  with the MAC OS icons on top
[positive]	[03:18]	<corevette>	what is everyone's favorite linux game?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<Kevin>	ardchoille, thankyou
[neutral]	[03:18]	<Jump86>	brunoUT, it's gdesklets, yes
[negative]	[03:18]	<Opiate>	Jump86:  Does Feisty look like MAC OS freshly installed or is that a theme of some sort ?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  what is that?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Jump86>	OpenTokix, it's Kore Suite + Gdesklets
[negative]	[03:19]	<randomc0de>	witless: nvidia proprietary driver?
[negative]	[03:19]	<Ax4>	hey guys, how do i find the path to open ssl?
[positive]	[03:19]	<debaser>	Stormx2: I actually enjoy any music which is about more than selling. That's rock, prog rock, jazz, blues, tango, and a great and large etc
[negative]	[03:19]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: yes, it's normal for ubuntu. ubuntu uses sudo instead of su
[negative]	[03:19]	<Stormx2>	debaser: My friend is a big prog rock fan... well actually I'm not sure. my knowledge of genres goes blurry with alt/prog. I guess you're talking about 20 minute songs with offbeat rhythms?
[negative]	[03:19]	<zipped20x>	eck: i mean almost ALL of the files that's downloading says failed
[neutral]	[03:19]	<witless>	randomc0de: yes
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Jump86>	brunoUT, sudo apt-get install gdesklets
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Lam_>	what file do i put a command into to have it run at startup?
[negative]	[03:19]	<randomc0de>	witless: try installing and running beryl-manager
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sudo uses your user password, while su uses root password, which is disabled by default
[neutral]	[03:19]	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  is that wheere u get the weather from too?
[negative]	[03:19]	<witless>	hmm ok
[negative]	[03:19]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Ok thanks.  So am I screwed for networking then? :S
[neutral]	[03:20]	<eck>	zipped20x: i think it is just because the servers are slow right now
[negative]	[03:20]	<witless>	"i thought that was actually less stable than ""desktop effects"""
[negative]	[03:20]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: what do you mean?
[negative]	[03:20]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: btw did that line work?
[negative]	[03:20]	<debaser>	"Stormx2: well, there's a JethroTull disc called ""Thick as a Brick"" which has one track, 42 minutes long, and it's just orgasmic."
[negative]	[03:20]	<Jump86>	"brunoUT, weather is an app for gdesklets for not a default one.. i had to get it from some other website.. google for ""goodweather gdesklets"" and youll find it"
[positive]	[03:20]	<eck>	zipped20x: with the feisty release, and all
[negative]	[03:20]	<zipped20x>	eck: so should i wait and if so how long?
[negative]	[03:20]	<randomc0de>	"witless: I'm not sure what they've done with the ""desktop effects"" but the amount of options there are far too few for me"
[negative]	[03:20]	<VividHazE>	Impaque:  No it didn't work, same Permission Denied error. Does it make a difference the client is a laptop using Wireless?
[negative]	[03:20]	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  sounds good
[negative]	[03:20]	<tgm4883_>	how do you change a networking device from eth1 to eth0?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: no
[positive]	[03:21]	<debaser>	Stormx2: but Pink Floyd, for example, is a high quality and known prog rock band, with offbeat rhythms
[negative]	[03:21]	<eck>	zipped20x: I'd just let it run in the background... you can also hold out a few days until things clear up
[neutral]	[03:21]	<corevette>	what are some good linux games
[negative]	[03:21]	<zipped20x>	eck: so should i wait and if so how long?
[positive]	[03:21]	<debaser>	Stormx2: Peter Gabriel is also very good
[negative]	[03:21]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Being able to transfer files across my network is nearly the only thing that doesn't work for me, its not an essential thing, but its pretty cool and so annoying it doesn't work
[negative]	[03:21]	<Fin>	corvette: armagetron advanced and tux racer are two free good ones, you can go buy doom or something if you want though
[negative]	[03:21]	<Kevin>	ardchoille. how to I get to comand line now, its just got a blinken cursor after *running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)
[neutral]	[03:22]	<dimeotane>	fin: don't forget tremulous
[neutral]	[03:22]	<ardchoille>	Kevin: CNTRL+ALT+F2  (or F3, F4, F5, F6)
[negative]	[03:22]	<zipped20x>	eck: yea but letting it run in the backround (being on dial-up) wouldn't almost all of them fail?
[neutral]	[03:22]	<debaser>	"ardchille: you should call ""control"" key CTRL"
[negative]	[03:22]	<vik>	I've just upgraded from an older ubuntu via backup and re-install, and I want to get my evolution settings back. I have all of the dot files from the home folder, and have copied .evolution and .gconf/apps/evolution, but when i start it up it still wants to go through the setup process. Any ideas?
[neutral]	[03:22]	<Fin>	dimeotane: never heard of that one to be honest *downloads*
[negative]	[03:22]	<VividHazE>	Impaque: And I know it isn't linux fault its my fault, if a linux expert were right here it would probably be working in 10 seconds, lol.  Anyway if you've no more advice I'll head on here, thanks for the time you spent trying.
[positive]	[03:23]	<Kevin>	ardchoille thanks again
[neutral]	[03:23]	<ardchoille>	debaser: Ah, yes, thanks.
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dimeotane>	corevette: have you tried tremulous yet? it's the crown jewel of ubuntu games if you ask me
[positive]	[03:23]	<ardchoille>	Kevin: You're welcome :)
[positive]	[03:23]	<Stormx2>	debaser: Pink Floyd are great heh. I love a lot of their stuff.
[neutral]	[03:23]	<holycow>	don't forget your .evolution folder too
[neutral]	[03:23]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: is nfs service started and all? is portmap started on the client? gimme some logs
[negative]	[03:23]	<corevette>	yes i have dimeotane...doesn't have enough strategy for me
[neutral]	[03:23]	<eck>	zipped20x: the ones that are successful will go somewhere in /var and when you run apt again you won't have to download them again

[negative]	[03:24]	<eck>	zipped20x: although i guess if nearly all of them are failing you might as well just hold out

[negative]	[03:24]	<owh>	Has anyone got any suggestions on where I go to learn more about how iocharsets work? Specifically, I'm trying to learn how it relates to file system mounting.
[neutral]	[03:24]	<eck>	Ax4: what component of openssl?
[neutral]	[03:24]	<zipped20x>	eck: for a day or two or four?
[negative]	[03:24]	<debaser>	Ax2: try something like pkg-config
[neutral]	[03:24]	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sudo tail -f /var/log/messages while mounting, it should show the error
[neutral]	[03:24]	<kkathman>	!sound
[negative]	[03:24]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[negative]	[03:43]	<ardchoille>	KevinOoO: I make it a habit of using the repos first. If the app/tool is not there, then I use other means.

[negative]	[03:43]	<Pelo>	tom_, sorry to hear you are having such difficulties but please remember that all the ppl here are just users like you, who volunteer their skill and knowledge of the system,  it we can't help you with something it's probably because we donT' know , so your options are to google, try the forum and figure it out on your own,  or alternatively I beleive canonical offers commercial support for a reasonnable fee.   and do bare in mind that I am n

[negative]	[03:43]	<GionnyBoss>	tom_: if people don't answer you, you have to be patient. Probably they don't know how to answer or they are busy. And remember that on these days, with feisty stable out, there's a big mess here
[negative]	[03:43]	<Jordan_U_>	calculator, So you want to know if there is a problem reading the CD on boot? Do you see anything at all when you try to boot from CD?
[positive]	[03:43]	<Fin>	calculator:  Try k3b? :)
[negative]	[03:43]	<delmorep>	mzaza: you might try beryl instead -- its in the repos now, remove compiz first.... ive never had any problems with beryl... but i had so many problems with compiz :( sometimes the close-X's on progams dont work... similar black screen problems that youve had too
[negative]	[03:44]	<NobleCommerc1>	this is a really dumb one, how do I specify the search directory for glslideshow?
[negative]	[03:44]	<WrektAA>	How do I change the Card I edit in terminal in Alsamixer?
[negative]	[03:44]	<calculator>	Jordan_U_: no. I want to know whether my CD burning drive is the problem
[negative]	[03:44]	<mzaza>	Ok, any ideas why the .asf movies runs very slow on the totem very slowly?
[negative]	[03:44]	<delmorep>	plus compiz looks shoddy sometimes.... the wobble effect is way contrived
[positive]	[03:44]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, very interesting >:)
[neutral]	[03:44]	<Jordan_U_>	calculator, Then check to see if the burned CD matches the md5 checksum
[positive]	[03:44]	<megafauna>	mzaza: use vlc media player. it is the schinit
[negative]	[03:44]	<KevinOoO>	ardchoille, ok its just that I think glx is older than the 9755 version, but then again I dont know

[positive]	[03:45]	<delmorep>	:) i cant believe they went with compiz... i know it has a better long term value... but im pretty sure the beryl team thought it was gonna be them... was probably a harsh letdown
[negative]	[03:45]	<megafauna>	Korvak: I can't tell you more than what I've said. You press a few buttons and it upgrades.
[negative]	[03:45]	<calculator>	Jordan_U_: i don't need to check the burned cd, because all of the burning programs I've used say that the burn process failed
[neutral]	[03:45]	<Jordan_U_>	!sudo | NemesisD

[negative]	[03:46]	<tom_>	Pelo, thanks for your response... I am just frustrated we have our exams winding up here in ann arbor and I just needed a place to vent... its just not a good time for me to have to reintall the operating system... and yes i realize that its people like this who make ubuntu sucessfull and that I have no one to  blame but myself for the problems... its just frustating and a i am blowing off steam

[negative]	[03:48]	<tom_>	:(
[negative]	[03:48]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: what do you want to bind it to
[neutral]	[03:48]	<Pelo>	tom_,  try just running ubuntu without the eye candy for a while , it's still pretty nice,   you donT' need beryl to have a working comp,  and you can play around with it later when you donT' have so much on your plate
[neutral]	[03:48]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, alt+f3 makes sense to me
[neutral]	[03:48]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: if its a standard app you can do it in keyboard shortcuts
[negative]	[03:48]	<NemesisD>	okay cool
[negative]	[03:48]	<vik>	which is better for feisty: automatix or easyubuntu?
[neutral]	[03:49]	<ardchoille>	!automatix
[negative]	[03:49]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[neutral]	[03:49]	<randomwalker>	vik: easyubuntu
[negative]	[03:49]	<eternalswd>	anyone know where I can get the High Contrast icon set, it appears to have disappeared after upgrading to feisty
[positive]	[03:49]	<Jordan_U_>	NobleCommerc1, It is much harder than it should be ( due to a stubborn gnome developer ) you need to edit the apropriate .desktop file
[negative]	[03:49]	<Pelo>	vik,  learn to install packages yourself,  you'll  learn a lot and save yourself some headaches later on
[neutral]	[03:49]	<blazemonger>	when will the molecule screensaver ever work?
[neutral]	[03:49]	<Pelo>	vik  @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:49]	<Meshezabeel>	eternalswd: try pressing windowskey+M

[neutral]	[03:49]	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: Look for the gnome-themes-accessibility or something similar.
[negative]	[03:49]	<blazemonger>	is there ever going to be a fix
[neutral]	[03:49]	<tom_>	Pelo,  yeahh university of michigan enging exams make me stress out
[negative]	[03:49]	<vik>	Pelo: I know how to do that; I'm just a bit lazy
[negative]	[03:49]	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, In what way does it not work?
[negative]	[03:49]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, keyboard shortcuts doesn't seem to have a way to add new shortcuts
[negative]	[03:50]	<justin64>	"Help! All the Virtual consoles are outputting the message: ""hdb: drive not ready for command"". hdb is the CDROM and there's no disk in the drive. It seems (???) like Linux is constantly trying to mount it!"
[negative]	[03:50]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: that's why i asked what you wanted to bind it _to_
[positive]	[03:50]	<moDumass>	thanks, so im adding a launcher, where would i find the installed app?
[positive]	[03:50]	<Korvak>	Ok -- after attempting to install an nVIDIA driver 3-different ways, and none of them allowing me to go higher than 1024 resolution, I'd hate to say it but, it's MUCH easier to install a driver over Windows XP.
[positive]	[03:50]	<blazemonger>	when i cclick on the molecule screensaver, it says 'loading molecules' then the mouse cursor turns all black
[neutral]	[03:50]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: if its a nonstandard target, you can do it with gconf-editor
[positive]	[03:50]	<Galga>	hi, when i do sudo apt-get update, it gives me an error of sudo timestamp set in future. i recently synchronized the clock with internet server. it changed the time back 5 hours.

[negative]	[03:51]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, okay, i'd like that if it isn't too much trouble
[negative]	[03:51]	<moDumass>	korvak you can manually add a resolution to xorg.conf, i had to do that since i have widescreen
[neutral]	[03:51]	<blazemonger>	has 128 mb memory
[neutral]	[03:51]	<Jordan_U_>	kmizeta, What card do you have?
[neutral]	[03:51]	<moDumass>	kmizeta see my previouse answer
[negative]	[03:51]	<Fujitsu>	kmizeta: It's 7.04... What kind of card is it?
[negative]	[03:51]	<Meshezabeel>	I have xscreensaver start at startup, since upgrading from 6.10 to 7.04, the xscreensaver banner sometimes stays on my screen, but is just a ghost banner, ie. if I try to click on it, it is actually what's behind it that gets clicked on, there is no way to get rid of this banner except log out and log back in. Any ideas how to fix this?

[neutral]	[03:51]	<KevinOoO>	what is the package name for ubuntu libc header files?
[neutral]	[03:51]	<Fujitsu>	!resolution

[neutral]	[03:53]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, i have config editor open now, we can just try metacity
[negative]	[03:53]	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: There are methods to get it to run in a 32-bit chroot, but they're entirely unsupported.
[negative]	[03:53]	<kalifornia909>	anyone have any idea why ubuntu isnt writing a partition table to a raid array
[neutral]	[03:53]	<Korvak>	modumass, I will try adding my resolutions to xorg.conf right now.

[negative]	[03:55]	<alcane>	Fujitsu: thx, i've been there and the only error I've gotten is it not working.

[neutral]	[03:56]	<dudu1982>	can someone help me?
[neutral]	[03:56]	<blazemonger>	i like rosegarden's simple interface
[neutral]	[03:56]	<msand>	KevinOoO, extract it to /usr/share/emerald/themes/<directoryfornewtheme>
[neutral]	[03:56]	<Fujitsu>	!helpme
[positive]	[03:56]	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative]	[03:56]	<chrissturm>	does feisty not support lilo?
[negative]	[03:56]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, works in metacity :/
[neutral]	[03:57]	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: It does, but grub is generally used instead.
[neutral]	[03:57]	<dudu1982>	it's a long one..
[positive]	[03:57]	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, You could find the developers responsible for midi hardware support and donate testing time / money / hardware ( they can't make it work if they don't have it :)
[negative]	[03:57]	<Fujitsu>	dudu1982: Nothing abnormal.
[positive]	[03:57]	<dudu1982>	hehehe :)
[negative]	[03:57]	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
[negative]	[03:57]	<blazemonger>	Jordan_U_:  i wouldnt mind even that
[negative]	[03:57]	<chrissturm>	Fujitsu: but why do i get this error? update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic The provided postinst hook script [/sbin/update-grub]  could not be run.
[positive]	[03:58]	<rbrtoclto>	some of my keys are behaving very strangely.. to get ` or ' I have to press the key then hit the spacebar
[negative]	[03:58]	<blazemonger>	thing is intel's drivers for my soundcard only run from redhat and suse and it's this sh script with this wiierd   scrambled letters
[neutral]	[03:58]	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: Try removing the grub package.
[positive]	[03:58]	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, beryl is a cruel mistress
[positive]	[03:58]	<kalifornia909>	is there a boot manager that will boot to a software raid array
[positive]	[03:59]	<rbrtoclto>	some of my keys are behaving very strangely.. to get ` or ' I have to press the key then hit the spacebar <-- this happens both in X and also from a standard tty
[negative]	[03:59]	<wil_syd>	Anyone using mt-daapd ? Which has to start first.. avahi or mt-daapd ?
[neutral]	[03:59]	<chrissturm>	Fujitsu: i dont have grub installed
[negative]	[04:00]	<Kix>	justin64: Whats the output from 'mount'?
[negative]	[04:00]	<rbrtoclto>	so I guess it's a system configuration thing?
[negative]	[04:00]	<nils_>	It looks like nobody has found a solution for the mouse not working with Feisty on VirtualPC. Is is possible to revert the kernel from 2.6.20 to 2.6.17, or would that be a bad thing?
[negative]	[04:00]	<Pelo>	rbrtoclto,  this occors on my keyb to because those signs are intended to go on top of other letters
[negative]	[04:00]	<msand>	I'm trying to record audio streams, but can't seem to get audacity to record the output of my sound card.  Tried all the options for Recording Device in Preferences.. no luck.
[positive]	[04:00]	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, Best be is probably to file a bug report at bugs.ubuntu.com and, if needed, offer your hardware for testing or to the developers. I would also suggest helping with testing Gutsy when it starts coming out as it is easier to encorperate changes early on
[negative]	[04:00]	<tehquickness>	how do you mount a cd image in ubuntu?
[negative]	[04:00]	<Kix>	justin64: Look for something like: /dev/scd0 on /media/cdrom0 type iso9660 (ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=luke)
[neutral]	[04:00]	<brunoUT>	hi
[negative]	[04:00]	<dudu1982>	i'm installing ubuntu and i want it wo work along with windows. i'm at the partiton part and i dont want to damege the other partitons...
[neutral]	[04:01]	<Kix>	tehquickness: mount -o loop /PATH/.img
[negative]	[04:01]	<rbrtoclto>	pelo: ahh, I don't need that functionality.. do you know how I can change the keyboard layout?
[positive]	[04:01]	<Kix>	tehquickness: followed by the mount path :p
[neutral]	[04:01]	<Pelo>	tehquickness,  @HLINK

[neutral]	[04:01]	<Kix>	tehquickness: so.. mount -o loop /my/.iso /to/here
[negative]	[04:01]	<blazemonger>	Jordan_U_:  i wish i knew how to prograk
[negative]	[04:01]	<tehquickness>	ok

[negative]	[04:01]	<Malachi>	Anyone had any luck with Democracy and Feisty?
[neutral]	[04:01]	<dudu1982>	can someone help in private plz?
[positive]	[04:02]	<blazemonger>	i would love to have a system that runs midi
[negative]	[04:02]	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 what is your problem
[neutral]	[04:02]	<blazemonger>	im new to pc's
[neutral]	[04:02]	<Pelo>	sky_shark,  we don'T support automatix here
[neutral]	[04:02]	<ardchoille>	!automatix
[negative]	[04:02]	<sky_shark>	oh okay
[negative]	[04:02]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[negative]	[04:02]	<justin64>	Kix: there's no listing of hdb or scd0
[neutral]	[04:02]	<dudu1982>	linux inst..
[negative]	[04:02]	<Jordan_U_>	dudu1982, You can resize your windows partition, but as with any time you mess with partitioning you should have important data backed up in case
[negative]	[04:02]	<BSG76>	anyone know of any good media center for ubuntu?
[negative]	[04:02]	<xtknight>	how can i get colors back in my terminal?  it's just all gray.  ls -al is colorless
[negative]	[04:02]	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 go join nibsa1242b and I'll see if I can help you there
[neutral]	[04:02]	<Pelo>	BSG76,   mythtv ?
[neutral]	[04:02]	<KevinOoO>	i think mythtv is good
[negative]	[04:02]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, which terminal emulator are you using?

[neutral]	[04:03]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, gnome-terminal
[neutral]	[04:03]	<BSG76>	my frontend won't work
[positive]	[04:03]	<rbrtoclto>	pelo: sweet, that's done the trick :)
[negative]	[04:03]	<rbrtoclto>	I had dead keys turned on
[positive]	[04:03]	<BSG76>	backend refuses to allow my frontend to connect
[negative]	[04:03]	<rbrtoclto>	I'm guessing that's what that is
[negative]	[04:03]	<sky_shark>	so do you guys know how I can make my ubuntu read and write to tmy windows partion?
[negative]	[04:03]	<sky_shark>	i can read it
[neutral]	[04:03]	<KevinOoO>	well tell your backend to tell your frontend to get his ass in gear
[positive]	[04:03]	<tuxplorer>	the update manager is downloading at a very slow rate.. how can I increase the speed? is there a way to ask it to download multiple packages parallely?
[negative]	[04:03]	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 and type my name once you are there so it beeps and know you are there
[neutral]	[04:03]	<xtknight>	!ntfs-3g | sky_shark

[neutral]	[04:04]	<moDumass>	!menu | moDumass
[negative]	[04:04]	<Pelo>	sky_shark,  it is suppose to be native in 7.04 I thinik
[neutral]	[04:04]	<moDumass>	just seeing what that does
[neutral]	[04:04]	<Tom47>	BSG76 i have a feeling this i so specialised a use as to warrant the use of the specialised didtribution
[neutral]	[04:04]	<eternalswd>	"xtknight, does ""ls --color=auto"" work?"
[positive]	[04:04]	<BSG76>	my mythtv settop has been working amazingly for last 4 years now :)
[neutral]	[04:04]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, yes it does
[negative]	[04:04]	<rbrtoclto>	xt: had any problems?  there was a race condition between some scripts in the beta that caused 9/10 boots to fail, I've only booted twice running feisty release and one has failed :(
[positive]	[04:04]	<Tom47>	BSG76 oops sorry you are the expert :)
[neutral]	[04:04]	<wil_syd>	sky_shark: install ntfs-config
[neutral]	[04:04]	<Jordan_U_>	sky_shark, @HLINK
[positive]	[04:04]	<BSG76>	no backend in on a my machine in the living room :)
[neutral]	[04:05]	<rbrtoclto>	"xt: it sits there with ""initramfs"""
[negative]	[04:05]	<sky_shark>	okay i will
[positive]	[04:05]	<rbrtoclto>	I rebooted and it was fine
[negative]	[04:05]	<xtknight>	rbrtoclto, nope not any problems with it
[negative]	[04:05]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, which shell are you using?
[neutral]	[04:05]	<xtknight>	rbrtoclto, besides the fact that deleting a raid array is difficult
[neutral]	[04:05]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, bash
[positive]	[04:05]	<BSG76>	lol been using myth since early versions .. I just don't know how it is setup in ubuntu :) ... normally use gentoo .. love ubuntu though :)

[neutral]	[04:05]	<ubotu>	MythTV is a TV framework for Linux - Instructions for using with Ubuntu at @HLINK
[negative]	[04:05]	<chrissturm>	heres a paste of my error message: @HLINK
[negative]	[04:06]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, then I would suggest putting in .bashrc the following: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
[positive]	[04:06]	<BSG76>	thanks ubotu .. I visited that already .. it's very basic at best :)
[positive]	[04:06]	<BSG76>	but thanks
[positive]	[04:06]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, thanks.  another user in ##linux suggested basicalyl the same thing
[negative]	[04:06]	<xtknight>	wonder how it got otherwise?
[negative]	[04:06]	<zce>	"is it possible to make NetworkManager in feisty automatically connect to the ""wired"" network? it is (and will always be) the only possible network"
[negative]	[04:06]	<xtknight>	ubuntu is that by default, no?
[negative]	[04:06]	<BSG76>	anyone know of any other one?
[positive]	[04:07]	<Tom47>	BSG76 where iare the best howtos for it?
[neutral]	[04:07]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, hrm i dont have a .bashrc.
[neutral]	[04:07]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, maybe the system configuration file for bash changed during an upgrade?
[negative]	[04:07]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, this is kinda weird, how do i get the default .bashrc?
[positive]	[04:07]	<BSG76>	well I have accumulated some experience over the years ..
[neutral]	[04:07]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, well i was juggling my /home folder around on diff partitions
[neutral]	[04:07]	<asdfasdf>	nibsa1242b it didnt work
[negative]	[04:08]	<delmorep>	Question: After I compile a program via './configure && make' and 'sudo make install' -- how do I uninstall? just delete the executable in /opt ???
[negative]	[04:08]	<rbrtoclto>	I run a couple of KDE apps under Gnome (Amarok, Kaffeine) and they look pretty horrible because I've disabled font hinting, but the KDE apps are still using hinting.. where can I turn that off?  I've tried qt3-config already but no dice
[neutral]	[04:08]	<Jordan_U_>	"zce, Just set up the wired connection as a ""manual configuration"""
[positive]	[04:08]	<J-_>	ah yeah, Gallery on Ubuntuforums is what I was looking for =D
[positive]	[04:08]	<BSG76>	however my lack of knowledge of ubuntu is surely haunting me right now :)
[negative]	[04:08]	<J-_>	err wrong channel lmao
[neutral]	[04:08]	<Impaque>	delmorep: you can sudo make uninstall
[neutral]	[04:08]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, is there a universal bashrc?
[neutral]	[04:08]	<kbrooks>	kay...
[neutral]	[04:08]	<dudu1982>	nibsa1242b, i'm in your private window can u respond plz?
[neutral]	[04:08]	<kbrooks>	Please read before you get Swiftfox or use it again:  @HLINK
[negative]	[04:08]	<Impaque>	delmorep: (if the Makefile has that) or manually delete files it installed across the system
[neutral]	[04:08]	<eternalswd>	"xtknight, default should be /etc/bash.bashrc so ""cp /etc/bash.bashrc ~/.bashrc"" should get you on your way"
[neutral]	[04:08]	<BSG76>	thanks guys .. if I figure it out I will find someone to post it or add it to the site
[neutral]	[04:09]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, or..where is the skeleton for adduser ?
[negative]	[04:09]	<dauoalagio2>	hello i cannot get my nvidia geforce4 mx 440 working on feisty
[negative]	[04:09]	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 you can't send priviate msg unless you are registered
[negative]	[04:09]	<delmorep>	Impaque: doh, i think i deleted the 'make' folder
[neutral]	[04:09]	<dudu1982>	ohh
[negative]	[04:09]	<Kix>	justin64: 'mount hdb' do anything?
[negative]	[04:09]	<dudu1982>	sorry for the stupid qu but do i reg?
[neutral]	[04:09]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, interesting, that didnt do it
[negative]	[04:09]	<zero88>	What are and how do you fix checksum errors???
[negative]	[04:10]	<Impaque>	delmorep: it's np, you can recreate that by running ./configure there, even without make install or such
[negative]	[04:10]	<cornel1>	I'm running dapper on an AMD 64. To upgrade, I would have to go to edgy, then fiesty?
[negative]	[04:10]	<Impaque>	delmorep: did you use any specific ./configure flags?
[neutral]	[04:10]	<nibsa1242b>	zero88 you'll have to re dl or re burn the disk
[negative]	[04:10]	<poomped>	Wow, I haven't used IRC in a long time
[positive]	[04:10]	<msand>	zero88: that means the file you downloaded is corrupt.  Try downloading it again
[negative]	[04:10]	<zce>	"Jordan_U_, how? what do you mean? in Manual configuration, theres the ""wired"" connection on the list of connections.. what do i have to do then?"
[negative]	[04:10]	<Kix>	justin64: sorry... not that
[positive]	[04:10]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, well you likely need to still add the alias line to .bashrc now: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
[neutral]	[04:10]	<zero88>	nibsal1242b msand ok thanks
[positive]	[04:11]	<Fujitsu>	zero88: Before downloading it again, check the MD5sum of the image:
[negative]	[04:11]	<delmorep>	Impaque: nope, it was the cleanest compile possible, 4 steps
[neutral]	[04:11]	<Fujitsu>	!md5sum | zero88
[positive]	[04:11]	<ubotu>	zero88: To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see @HLINK for more
[positive]	[04:11]	<zero88>	Fujitsu its a game. its a .run file
[negative]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, so the default in Feisty is no colors?
[negative]	[04:11]	<eternalswd>	xtknight, and then reopen gnome-terminal or it won't register
[positive]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, very interesting
[neutral]	[04:11]	<cornel1>	!upgrade
[neutral]	[04:11]	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:11]	<Jordan_U_>	zce, Turn off roaming mode
[positive]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	eternalswd, gotcha it works great now
[negative]	[04:11]	<Impaque>	delmorep: then just do whatever you did, but instead of make install, type make uninstall
[neutral]	[04:11]	<rbrtoclto>	anyone know how to change font hinting preferences for KDE apps?
[positive]	[04:11]	<delmorep>	Impaque: awesome! thanks a million my friend :)
[neutral]	[04:12]	<Fujitsu>	rbrtoclto: -> Kubuntu
[neutral]	[04:12]	<Impaque>	delmorep: worked?
[neutral]	[04:12]	<Fujitsu>	#kubuntu, that is.
[negative]	[04:12]	<zce>	Jordan_U_, on the properties of the connection there is this option, and is already disabled
[negative]	[04:12]	<delmorep>	Impaque: yah, maybe i should try before I celebrate
[neutral]	[04:12]	<rbrtoclto>	fuj: I'm using Ubuntu with Gnome and just a couple of KDE apps
[neutral]	[04:13]	<sc0tch>	is there a way to import the current generic kernel config into an installed linux-source package?
[neutral]	[04:13]	<tehquickness>	also it is asking for a filesystem
[neutral]	[04:13]	<xtknight>	sc0tch, cp ~/boot/config-`uname -r` .config
[neutral]	[04:13]	<tehquickness>	when I try to mount the image
[positive]	[04:13]	<dudu1982>	(02:05:28) dudu1982: i want windows to work along with linux just until i learn to use it.
[negative]	[04:13]	<dudu1982>	(02:05:52) dudu1982: i craeted a partition with 20gb on it just for linux.
[negative]	[04:13]	<dudu1982>	(02:06:12) dudu1982: what do i do now?
[positive]	[04:13]	<dudu1982>	(02:07:22) dudu1982: how do i edit the partiton? can my pre OS get hart?
[neutral]	[04:13]	<xtknight>	sc0re_, er /boot not ~/boot
[neutral]	[04:13]	<Johnny_>	just got a 400 gb harddrive will ubuntu support it
[negative]	[04:13]	<delmorep>	Impaque: worked like a charm, maybe you're a good person to ask... this was my first compile... if i wanted to take my knowledge a step further, do you know of a good resource
[neutral]	[04:14]	<dager>	Johnny_: yes
[negative]	[04:14]	<xtknight>	Johnny_, yes if your controller/bios does
[negative]	[04:14]	<rbrtoclto>	I'll try in there
[negative]	[04:14]	<huXfluX>	Hello all! Has anyone heard of such a problem? I've just installed festy fawn on a toshiba laptop and the sound volume is very low. I'm playing an mp3 and i can bearly hear it. The volumes are at max (volume control in gnome and alsamixer in CLI). The sound card is a Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02). What to do?
[neutral]	[04:14]	<Johnny_>	kk
[neutral]	[04:14]	<ardchoille>	what is the avahi-daemon for?
[negative]	[04:14]	<Johnny_>	how do i check if my bios will
[negative]	[04:14]	<Journeyman>	how do you read iptables logs?
[positive]	[04:14]	<sc0tch>	worked perfect, thank you xtknight.
[negative]	[04:14]	<rbrtoclto>	"so far Feisty has been way less painful than Edgy to get ""just right"""
[neutral]	[04:14]	<blazemonger>	who knows someone who can build a Digital Audio Workstation for me?
[positive]	[04:14]	<Impaque>	delmorep: well, i learned my share from README files and ./configure --help.. also, reading the Makefile (after ./configure) gives a lot of hints
[positive]	[04:15]	<blazemonger>	that uses professional toools like rosegarde
[positive]	[04:15]	<xtknight>	"sc0tch, check out the ubuntu ""master kernel thread"" on the ubuntuforums (works great for me all the time)"
[neutral]	[04:15]	<xtknight>	if you're building a kernel..
[neutral]	[04:15]	<tehquickness>	can ubuntu mount an mdf image?
[neutral]	[04:15]	<Fujitsu>	tehquickness: Not directly, but mdf2iso can convert it to an ISO.
[negative]	[04:15]	<delmorep>	Impaque: I hear ya, I guess the options are dependent on the program afterall, I will investigate new configurations now that I know how to uninstall
[negative]	[04:15]	<tehquickness>	ok I will try that
[neutral]	[04:16]	<Tom47>	!avahi
[negative]	[04:16]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about avahi - try searching on @HLINK
[positive]	[04:16]	<eternalswd>	dudu1982, if you already have a 20gb partition set apart for linux, then just install to that partition.  you'll need to reformat that partition to ext3 if you haven't already (the install disc should take care of that). and you need a small partition set aside for swap.  the partition for windows shouldn't be touched
[neutral]	[04:16]	<locke1689>	hey, does anyone have an HDBits account?
[positive]	[04:16]	<Impaque>	delmorep: ofcourse, they are different for each program almost.. some of the programs will not configure without additional ./configure flags etc.. README should point that out..
[positive]	[04:17]	<dauoalagio2>	how can i share folders wirelessly between two ubuntu computers?
[positive]	[04:17]	<cornel1>	"The command: gksu ""update-manager -c"" ,  that will use the appropriate version, that is, use 64  bit?"
[negative]	[04:17]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, but I dont see what is wrong with them?
[positive]	[04:17]	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh works well, but it might not be quite what you're looking for
[neutral]	[04:18]	<Jordan_U_>	cornel1, Yes
[neutral]	[04:18]	<delmorep>	Impaque: Ive used nothing but Ubuntu for almost a year, im just now starting to understand how useful the terminal is.... wget is awesome!  thanks for the information
[positive]	[04:18]	<Impaque>	delmorep: np ;)
[negative]	[04:18]	<dauoalagio2>	dager, one can't start x, so i am trying to back everything up
[positive]	[04:18]	<cornel1>	Thanks  Jordan_U_
[negative]	[04:18]	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh is completely command-line, unless you get a frontend
[negative]	[04:18]	<sky_shark>	i installed the ntfs-config tool but it only lets me select an external device and grays out the internal device
[positive]	[04:18]	<Jordan_U_>	delmorep, wget -c for bad connections ( will keep re-trying ) :)
[neutral]	[04:18]	<sky_shark>	option
[positive]	[04:18]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: system > Administration > shared Folders lets you share folders over a network
[neutral]	[04:19]	<locke1689>	also, kernel 2.6.*.11, that break anyone elses ethernet card?
[negative]	[04:19]	<locke1689>	like it worked... then it didnt
[negative]	[04:19]	<dauoalagio2>	msand, no gui - x won't start,
[neutral]	[04:19]	<cornell>	Know any problems with Edgy or Fiesty for 64bit?
[negative]	[04:19]	<locke1689>	still cant get it fixed, just running in .10
[positive]	[04:19]	<lbci_irc>	tda9887.ko is missing on my machine after update... has it been moved/obseleted/forgotten?
[negative]	[04:19]	<msand>	ah, okay.  Well, you can use samba for it.
[neutral]	[04:19]	<jimmygoon>	HEY! FEISTY ROCKS! THANKS!
[positive]	[04:19]	<delmorep>	Jordan_U: awesome, just like when a Quake3 server is full... i mean, an OpenArena server ;)
[negative]	[04:19]	<Crav>	how do i upgrade from dapper to fiesty without needing to download the cd image?
[negative]	[04:19]	<sky_shark>	does anyone know what i should do to get ubuntu fiesty to write to my windows partion?
[neutral]	[04:19]	<umop>	jimmygoon, What's so good about it?
[negative]	[04:19]	<msand>	I only ever share with windows.. but you don't need to include a windows box on the network for it to work
[neutral]	[04:20]	<locke1689>	Crav: apt-get dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[04:20]	<Kix>	<sky_shark: what file system?
[neutral]	[04:20]	<Jordan_U_>	!upgrade | Crav
[neutral]	[04:20]	<ubotu>	Crav: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:20]	<cornell>	!upgrade | Crav
[negative]	[04:20]	<Kix>	sky_shark: ntfs writting is unstable... you can safely read / write to fat partitions
[positive]	[04:20]	<Crav>	cornell: thanks
[negative]	[04:20]	<jimmygoon>	umop, its faster, it detects my memory card reader (built in) and it looks (Better , at leasT)
[positive]	[04:20]	<Crav>	Jordan_U_: thanks
[positive]	[04:20]	<boss>	Is performance the only downside to using software RAID?
[neutral]	[04:21]	<boss>	As opposed to hardware RAID...
[negative]	[04:21]	<blazemonger>	how do i prevent ubuntu from crashing when i run the molecule screensaver
[neutral]	[04:21]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
[negative]	[04:21]	<boss>	And I suppose not being able to use anything besides RAID 0[+1]  or RAID1[+0] 
[neutral]	[04:21]	<Jordan_U_>	boss, No, poor support under Linux also
[neutral]	[04:21]	<umop>	jimmygoon, sounds good! glad it works for you
[positive]	[04:21]	<Impaque>	boss: well, with multi-threading CPUs of modern times, the overhead is just a few percent..
[neutral]	[04:21]	<cotton>	Doesn't ubuntu already come with LAMP installed?
[positive]	[04:21]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: samba's pretty easy to configure through the command line
[positive]	[04:21]	<locke1689>	msand: depends :)
[positive]	[04:21]	<Impaque>	boss: with software raid, you can use any combo i believe
[negative]	[04:22]	<wastrel>	why not just tar and scp
[neutral]	[04:22]	<boricua>	!LAMP
[positive]	[04:22]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[negative]	[04:22]	<boss>	I guess cost as well then.
[negative]	[04:22]	<dager>	blazemonger: if its a 3d screensaver, make sure you have the correct video drivers
[neutral]	[04:22]	<boss>	So basically nowadays, what reasons are there to use hardware RAID?
[negative]	[04:22]	<msand>	Well, for basic sharing it is.  I use it on a lan, so I don't worry too much about security.  Just basic username/password check.  No complaints
[negative]	[04:22]	<jimmygoon>	Speaking of dealing with feisty, my friend is an idiot and installed a nasty deb that now won't remove because its in a very bad inconsistent state... thats a quote... any ideas?
[negative]	[04:23]	<Kazol>	I am trying to choose a theme for Ubuntu. What types are compatible with Ubuntu? Is it GDM, Icon, or XMMS?
[neutral]	[04:23]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: how to anywhere?
[negative]	[04:23]	<locke1689>	boss: well, youre not reliant on a specific operating system or piece of software
[negative]	[04:23]	<Doughy>	I am having a problem re-logging into gnome.  If I try to log into an already-logged-in acocunt, my graphics go out.  My screen flickers white/brown... ideas?
[negative]	[04:23]	<umop>	jimmygoon, tell him to apt-get remove packagname
[neutral]	[04:23]	<eric>	boss: Saving CPU time and PCI bus bandwidth.
[neutral]	[04:23]	<Impaque>	boss: well, for some really intensive CPU loads and simultaneous writes, hardware raid is the way to go. but for a general file server, no need to go hardware IMHO. i had some bad experiences with Promise controllers, i go software from then on
[positive]	[04:23]	<blazemonger>	dager: i have a high quality rage 128 card though
[negative]	[04:23]	<blazemonger>	and it runs every other 3d screensaver
[neutral]	[04:23]	<xtknight>	boss, swraid is faster in lots of cases
[neutral]	[04:23]	<boss>	Gotcha.
[negative]	[04:23]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, What .deb? if it truly won't remove then you probably need to edit whatever script is failing
[neutral]	[04:23]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: Depends on what you are trying to theme. You theming xmms? GDM? Window manager? other?
[negative]	[04:24]	<boss>	xtknight: Seriously?
[positive]	[04:24]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: plenty.  I'm looking for the one I used when I first set it up.
[positive]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, in many cases yea
[negative]	[04:24]	<dager>	blazemonger: ah, well sometimes the problem can be you don't have the drivers installed correctly.. perhaps its a coding problem specific to that screensaver
[positive]	[04:24]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: thanks
[positive]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, hardware raid is cross platform in some cases (if Win2k has a driver and linux has a driver for your card).  not sure that you can mount linux mdadm under win2k, for example
[neutral]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	boss, but software RAID is much easier to manage.  no hardware needed so you can move it amongst PCs
[negative]	[04:25]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, its some bcm43xx-firmware hacked together package he found (he should have waited for me to use ndiswrapper)
[neutral]	[04:25]	<cabajgtr_>	Is there an easy way to rebuild /dev ?
[negative]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	hey guys need some help
[neutral]	[04:25]	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
[negative]	[04:25]	<Kazol>	ardchoille: I am trying to theme the whole gui of everything, including the title bars. Something like this: @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:25]	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question
[negative]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	my video in play mode is not full screen any more
[neutral]	[04:25]	<yell0w>	!defunct
[neutral]	[04:25]	<xtknight>	boss,  not to mention the raid on which your HD is based is a wide open standard, not some proprietary hole in the wall hardware chipset
[negative]	[04:25]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about defunct - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: but on other hand, consider this: if you go hardware, and your RAID card dies, you must get exactly the SAME model.. unfortunately, they tend to die after few years = they are hard to find..
[negative]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	i use xine as a player
[negative]	[04:25]	<xtknight>	Impaque, yeah that's exactly why im using SWRAID right now...forget HW raid
[positive]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: with software, you can migrate to different IDE/SATA cards
[negative]	[04:25]	<Impaque>	xtknight: yeah, it rocks.
[negative]	[04:25]	<boricua>	yellow: use kill -9 pid to remove defunct process
[negative]	[04:25]	<amicrawler>	when i play video it is at the bottom of the screen
[neutral]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	Well
[positive]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	Try not to use -9 unless a standard kill pid doesn't terminate it.
[positive]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	-9 is a little overkill for MOST processes.
[negative]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	or is  over lapped video
[positive]	[04:26]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, I disagree about using NDIS wrapper :) But in what way won't it remove ( and BTW there is an official broadcom firmware package in the Ubuntu repos )
[neutral]	[04:26]	<umop>	amicrawler, You can't drag it up?
[positive]	[04:26]	<SeveredCross>	The stubborn ones that don't end otherwise, fire the -9 away.
[negative]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	nope
[negative]	[04:26]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That's going to take several themes. I see: xmms theme, window manager theme, gtk2 theme, icon theme, etc. Besides, that picture looks like he's using kde.
[neutral]	[04:26]	<boricua>	or from command like killall apps
[neutral]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	when in full screen
[neutral]	[04:26]	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question in on line other wise noone will be able to keep track of it
[positive]	[04:26]	<xtknight>	swraid is soo awesome
[negative]	[04:26]	<Kix>	amicrawler: what output driver are you using?
[negative]	[04:26]	<stalkerguypc>	oh where is beryl effect channel
[neutral]	[04:26]	<amicrawler>	opengl
[neutral]	[04:26]	<xtknight>	!beryl
[positive]	[04:26]	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[positive]	[04:26]	<vadvad>	hi! new user in need here :)
[negative]	[04:26]	<stalkerguypc>	I want to get that puff of smoke working
[negative]	[04:27]	<cotton>	How can I install mysql?
[neutral]	[04:27]	<Kazol>	ardchoille: What theme would include the title bars of programs, for example?
[neutral]	[04:27]	<amicrawler>	just updates to  fawn
[neutral]	[04:27]	<Tom47>	#ubuntu-effects
[negative]	[04:27]	<stalkerguypc>	ah ok
[positive]	[04:27]	<dager>	vavad, just ask :)
[positive]	[04:27]	<stalkerguypc>	thanks
[negative]	[04:27]	<jimmygoon>	"Jordan_U_, it literally says that message ""package is in a very bad state"" try to reinstall it or something like that"
[neutral]	[04:27]	<boricua>	cotton: use synaptic
[negative]	[04:27]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That would be the window manager, the default wm in gnome is metacity.
[neutral]	[04:27]	<behdad>	Hi all , i can not login to , when i typein my username and password after a while it returns to the same login page .
[neutral]	[04:27]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: You using gnome?
[negative]	[04:27]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, I dunna about the package vs ndiswrapper but I know what he did was WRONG... esp when I had ndiswrapper working a week ago :S
[negative]	[04:27]	<cabajgtr>	no one knows how to rebuild /dev ?
[negative]	[04:27]	<DeadCowBoy>	Did Canonical think about new and faster servers since the release of feisty?
[neutral]	[04:27]	<vadvad>	hi dager! i wanna make my windows work along with linux, how?
[neutral]	[04:27]	<amicrawler>	kix  what do you think
[negative]	[04:27]	<behdad>	any body knows what is the problem ?
[negative]	[04:27]	<cotton>	boricua: What do I download in synaptic, I don't thik there is just a mysql package
[positive]	[04:28]	<Kazol>	ardchoille: I am new to Linux. I am just using the default in 6.06 dapper drake.
[negative]	[04:28]	<Kix>	amicrawler: what frontend are you using?
[negative]	[04:28]	<locke1689>	so, just making sure, no one has an HDBits or Oink account? I could trade Demonoid.
[negative]	[04:28]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, Sorry i havn't been talking to Mark.
[negative]	[04:28]	<Jack3>	how do i install source code that has INSTALL file and MAKEFILE
[negative]	[04:28]	<dager>	vadvad: what exactly do you mean? on the same computer?
[neutral]	[04:28]	<amicrawler>	like gdm or kdm ?
[neutral]	[04:28]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Can you pastebin the output of: sudo dpkg -r whatever.deb
[neutral]	[04:28]	<boricua>	cotton: when you select mysql also select client do a search for mysql in synaptic and install what you need
[neutral]	[04:28]	<Kazol>	ardchoille: thx, I will try to install theme
[neutral]	[04:28]	<vadvad>	yap
[neutral]	[04:28]	<towsonu2003>	behdad, have a look at whether you have space in your hard drive
[negative]	[04:28]	<amicrawler>	or  video
[positive]	[04:28]	<Impaque>	software RAID is easy to set up and with today's CPUs, the overhead is so negligible..
[neutral]	[04:28]	<amicrawler>	xine
[neutral]	[04:28]	<boricua>	!mysql cotton
[negative]	[04:28]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about mysql cotton - try searching on @HLINK
[positive]	[04:28]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop wouldn't be a bad idea :P
[neutral]	[04:28]	<boricua>	!mysql @ cotton
[negative]	[04:28]	<cabajgtr>	cotton, it should be there, or you could use 'sudo apt-get install mysql'
[negative]	[04:28]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about mysql @ cotton - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:28]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, haha.
[negative]	[04:28]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: I can't find the one I used, but I might be able to walk you through it if you don't need to do anything unusual
[positive]	[04:28]	<ardchoille>	Kazol: Then you are using the metacity window manager in gnome. Find a good metacity theme: @HLINK  or  @HLINK
[negative]	[04:28]	<zeroday>	jack3: read the readme
[negative]	[04:28]	<Ax4>	im having a problem with getting my SSL Certificate to work with Ezbounce under Feisty7.0.4, any ideas?
[neutral]	[04:28]	<boricua>	!mysql

[negative]	[04:28]	<Kix>	xine is the engine... I mean like mplayer, totem??
[positive]	[04:29]	<xtknight>	Impaque, so true, i could just dedicate my second CPU core to raid (actually while running hdparm on it im still 0% cpu)
[positive]	[04:29]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop not to talk to mark but to add servers :P
[negative]	[04:29]	<amicrawler>	nope xine
[neutral]	[04:29]	<amicrawler>	gui
[negative]	[04:29]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, I know what you mean.
[positive]	[04:29]	<Kix>	Oh... oh... :p
[negative]	[04:29]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, yes, but can you tell me what the package is called that you told me would work instead for his bcm43xx stuff
[negative]	[04:29]	<huXfluX>	Hello all! Has anyone heard of such a problem? I've just installed festy fawn on a toshiba laptop and the sound volume is very low. I'm playing an mp3 and i can bearly hear it. The volumes are at max (volume control in gnome and alsamixer in CLI). The sound card is a Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02). What to do?
[negative]	[04:29]	<behdad>	towsonu: i dont know what is the command from terminal to get howmuch is my free space !
[neutral]	[04:29]	<Ax4>	behdad, df -h
[neutral]	[04:29]	<blazemonger>	huXfluX: im having the same similar problem
[neutral]	[04:29]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[positive]	[04:29]	<stelios>	hello there, i already have windows vista on my laptop, the hardisk has 3 partitions, the one which runs vista and the other one which use to be the recovery partition but is no longer working because it was for xp, now i want to install ubuntu 7.04 on the recovery partition which is 13.5GB(+/-) is there any website about how i can do this? or  somebody can explain? is it possible to do this?
[negative]	[04:29]	<dager>	vadvad: you'll want to dual boot.. check out @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:29]	<Impaque>	"huXfluX: did you turn the ""hardware"" up? (volume knob, buttons) ?"
[negative]	[04:29]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: nah i just need files from a computer that's screwed over to a working ubuntu computer
[neutral]	[04:29]	<vadvad>	10x!
[negative]	[04:30]	<Shaba1>	behdad disk space or ram?
[neutral]	[04:30]	<zeroday>	huXfluX: go to ubuntuforums and search toshiba sound fix
[neutral]	[04:30]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop i've been struggling to get my apt-get to download programs since the release... tonight it's working but is incredibly slow
[neutral]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	intel needs to release drivers for distros other than redhat or suse
[negative]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	i dont have anything against suse or anything
[negative]	[04:30]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, I tried that method and it didn't work out so hawt with his card (its a stupid one)
[neutral]	[04:30]	<Kix>	amicrawler: have you played with the video settings? you should be able to choose which driver you want to use for output?
[neutral]	[04:30]	<blazemonger>	i just prefer a *nix based environment
[negative]	[04:30]	<xtknight>	no program can tell any difference between a block device of /dev/sdaX and /dev/mdX, is that correct?  /dev/mdX acts EXACTLY as a hd device?  wiping it with zeros will write 0s to the logical partition, it wont destroy the raid array?
[neutral]	[04:30]	<burner>	stelios: use gparted on teh livecd
[neutral]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	Impaque: where?
[neutral]	[04:30]	<Kix>	amicrawler: in xine player
[neutral]	[04:30]	<behdad>	got it shaba thanks
[negative]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	blazemonger: what did you do?
[negative]	[04:30]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: That's right.
[positive]	[04:30]	<Ax4>	stelios, the recovery partition should still be accessible before you boot an OS
[neutral]	[04:30]	<huXfluX>	zeroday: thanx
[neutral]	[04:30]	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Did you try it with Feisty?
[negative]	[04:30]	<cotton>	cabajgtr: Do I need to shutdown Apache before installing it?
[positive]	[04:30]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, an option is to download the alternate cd and upgrade from it, I think the mirrors will be slow for a while yet.
[positive]	[04:30]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: Things like hdparm will act differently, but they're very special and not commonly used.
[positive]	[04:30]	<behdad>	:))) Available space : 0 , thanku all
[negative]	[04:31]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop already too late for that :(
[neutral]	[04:31]	<burner>	anyone know if there's  an #ubuntu channel for server related stuff?
[negative]	[04:31]	<msand>	dauoalagio2: ah.. and scp's no good?
[positive]	[04:31]	<stelios>	Ax4: this is my first time i try any distro of linux can you please explain how or where i can find it?
[negative]	[04:31]	<Ax4>	stelios, it's the entire point of having it there in cases stuff gets messed up, i personally would leave that space alone and not over write it, instead partition the other remaining partition into two pieces
[negative]	[04:31]	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, yeah
[neutral]	[04:31]	<Impaque>	huXfluX: on your laptop.. on my toshiba, i have a volume knob
[negative]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	ah
[neutral]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	yes, of course
[positive]	[04:31]	<huXfluX>	it's at max
[positive]	[04:31]	<jube>	I want to create some short videos (just youtube length / style). Can anyone recommend a simple movie studio program I can install on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[04:31]	<Fujitsu>	jube: Try Kino.
[neutral]	[04:31]	<Ax4>	stelios, as burner said, use gparted
[negative]	[04:31]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, I don't think it is.. Maybe a slight chance of a package breaking, but they shouldn't and you can always recover them.
[positive]	[04:31]	<stelios>	Ax4: i know but it's not working anymore :)
[negative]	[04:31]	<blazemonger>	huXfluX: in windows the drivers are these soundmax 4 program
[positive]	[04:31]	<papatwilight>	IMO feisty fawn is a lot better than edgy eft,
[negative]	[04:31]	<Ax4>	again, im having a problem with getting my SSL Certificate to work with Ezbounce under Feisty7.0.4, any ideas?
[positive]	[04:31]	<behdad>	jube : you can find pretty fine video editor in 7.04
[neutral]	[04:32]	<jube>	fuijitusu, thanks, I'll check out kino
[neutral]	[04:32]	<DeadCowBoy>	umop i've formatted my main partition already
[negative]	[04:32]	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, know of a good buffered and unbuffered HD write benchmark for linux?  (out of repos)
[positive]	[04:32]	<Ax4>	stelios, what's not working?
[neutral]	[04:32]	<towsonu2003>	behdad, use this: df -h
[positive]	[04:32]	<burner>	stelios: what's not working?
[negative]	[04:32]	<jube>	behdad, I have feisty running, what is the video editor called?
[negative]	[04:32]	<LM1>	How do I force a hardware redetect?
[neutral]	[04:32]	<dauoalagio2>	msand: scp?
[neutral]	[04:32]	<Cactusbin>	i must agree 7.04 is better than eft by a long shot
[positive]	[04:32]	<behdad>	towsonu2003: thanku man i got it its free space is 0 now :)
[neutral]	[04:32]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U, @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:32]	<Darwinian>	evening, has anyone had any experience with booting from pcmcia ide in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[04:32]	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, oh ok, well you can still potentially grab an ISO and do a clean install then, depends if you think it will save time.
[positive]	[04:33]	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: hdparm. It works fine on LVM, so should on md.
[neutral]	[04:33]	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, ya it only tests reads

[positive]	[04:33]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.

[neutral]	[04:34]	<pandimus>	Hello all
[neutral]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	i like xfs for handling huge files
[negative]	[04:34]	<cire_>	i added that resolution the xorg.conf file but no luck
[neutral]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	ext3 is probably the most reliable

[neutral]	[04:34]	<locke1689>	vadvad: xfs
[neutral]	[04:34]	<vadvad>	what is swap?
[neutral]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	xfs has a defratg util
[positive]	[04:34]	<xtknight>	vadvad, it is the page file or partition
[positive]	[04:34]	<Jordan_U>	jimmygoon, probably a good idea, I can't think of what that package could have been trying to do, it should be very simple, but if whoever made it didn't know that such a thing already existed they probably can't be trusted to greatly :)
[positive]	[04:34]	<Impaque>	vadvad: xfs is the best bang for the buck.
[neutral]	[04:34]	<Impaque>	but..
[negative]	[04:34]	<Ax4>	stelios, if you over wrote the recovery partition, it's gone and you'll have to contact your computer manufacturer / distributor for recovery CDs, you can still install ubuntu on any remaining partitions if you are currently without an operating system though

[negative]	[04:35]	<revmischa>	how do i make my gnome menubars come back?
[positive]	[04:35]	<Jordan_U>	cotton, You can only have one package manager running at once
[positive]	[04:35]	<locke1689>	xtknight: its a lot faster though, and a lot more efficient in storage
[positive]	[04:35]	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U, thanks for all your help
[positive]	[04:35]	<revmischa>	running gnome is pretty annoying when you can't open any windows

[negative]	[04:42]	<xtknight>	Impaque, tried ext4?
[negative]	[04:42]	<TokenBad>	rrittenhouse, I had problems with it...but it was saying the drives was messed up..so I went to dapper...installed it...then went and installed feisty
[negative]	[04:42]	<Doughy>	I am having a problem re-logging into gnome.  If I try to log into an already-logged-in acocunt, my graphics go out.  My screen flickers white/brown... ideas?
[negative]	[04:42]	<locke1689>	wind: thats a bittorrent client though, do you know how to use bittorrent?

[negative]	[04:42]	<Jack3>	guys, am i gonna screw over my UBuntu build if I remove the built in ieee80211 files and replace them with my own build???????????
[positive]	[04:43]	<Ax4>	"stelios, you can go into control panel -> administrative tools -> computer management -> disk management -> and select the partition, then ""SHRINK"" it down, then reboot using the ubuntu live cd and partition the ubuntu install into that empty space you make :)"
[negative]	[04:43]	<Impaque>	xtknight: nope, i left that to my bleedingedgier gentoo friends.. who burned themselves with it
[negative]	[04:43]	<msand>	locke1689: why do you say that?  I haven't had any problems with it, but I haven't used it all that long.  I've used azureus and it was never as fast as ktorrent is.
[positive]	[04:43]	<wind>	no i dont. new to linux. a baby in command line
[neutral]	[04:43]	<LM1>	yes it does show it in lspic
[negative]	[04:43]	<xtknight>	Impaque,  im hoping they're adding speed improvements but it looks mostly like expanding volume and file size limits, etc... the 'boring' server-related  stuff
[negative]	[04:43]	<Fnyar>	zeroday, hmm, I don't have any wireless adapters...
[neutral]	[04:43]	<tehquickness>	Has anyone installed the newest at drivers??
[negative]	[04:43]	<drumline_>	geezuz...  Ubuntu really screwed my MBR...  that's just retarded.
[positive]	[04:43]	<dager>	msand: try rtorrent.. it'll knock your socks off ;)
[negative]	[04:43]	<Ax4>	stelios, or you can boot with the ubuntu livecd, and use gparted to shrink down your VISTA partition or any other partition

[negative]	[04:43]	<Lam_>	my ubuntu server was just upgraded to feisty, and now it doesn't seem to be running rc.local on bootup anymore. any inquiries as to why?
[negative]	[04:43]	<zeroday>	fnyar: Its in there by defual you could try sudo apt-get remove network-manger
[neutral]	[04:43]	<zeroday>	*defualt
[neutral]	[04:44]	<Ax4>	tmgomez, we all have questions, just ask
[negative]	[04:44]	<Fujitsu>	TokenBad: It means that you should look for a bug report, and file one if it isn't already there. Something is broken.
[positive]	[04:44]	<Impaque>	xtknight: well, server stuff is very important to me ;) but i won't put it on my servers until some years pass and it proves itself stable
[neutral]	[04:44]	<tmgomez>	i forgot what the command to install the desktop on there server edition is????
[neutral]	[04:44]	<n122vu>	has anyone had problems upgrading from edgy?
[negative]	[04:44]	<rrittenhouse>	Is anybody else having problems with the feisty installer where your drives arent showing up?
[neutral]	[04:44]	<tmgomez>	sudo get-apt install ubuntu-desktop?
[negative]	[04:44]	<TokenBad>	Fujitsu, ok how do I do the bug report?
[neutral]	[04:44]	<towsonu2003>	tmbg, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[positive]	[04:44]	<stelios>	Ax4: may i ask why is needed to shrink the partition?(sorry i'm new to this :)
[neutral]	[04:44]	<tmgomez>	TY
[negative]	[04:44]	<TokenBad>	mean where do I look
[neutral]	[04:44]	<towsonu2003>	tmgomez, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[neutral]	[04:44]	<TokenBad>	stelios, you can use gparted
[neutral]	[04:45]	<chrisjs169|afk>	tmbg: or sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
[neutral]	[04:45]	<Fujitsu>	TokenBad: It's bug #91392

[negative]	[04:45]	<pandimus>	When i was using the live cd of ubuntu, my wireless worked fine, now i cannot see the wireless adapter in the network connection menu, and when i tried to install a windows driver via ndiswapper it said the driver is already installed
[positive]	[04:45]	<LM1>	is there a command to redetect hardware?
[neutral]	[04:45]	<xtknight>	Impaque, honesly ext3 has been treating me well.  and raid0 is looking to be fast
[neutral]	[04:45]	<Fujitsu>	@HLINK
[positive]	[04:45]	<locke1689>	msand: in my experience it operates without about the same resources, not as many options, and slower than azureus
[negative]	[04:45]	<Ax4>	stelios, if you don't break up the operating system areas you are going to lose windows, you can't have two operating systems occupying the same region of space on the hard disk
[negative]	[04:45]	<towsonu2003>	tmbg, sorry, tab gave wrong nickname -nevermind

[neutral]	[04:45]	<kbidd>	Im trying to set up port forwarding on azureus, and have checked and double-checked the router setup, and now think connections might be getting blocked by something in ubuntu -- is this possible?
[negative]	[04:45]	<zeroday>	ppandiumus: Unplug and then replug your wireless adapter
[neutral]	[04:45]	<TokenBad>	open terminal
[negative]	[04:45]	<Tom47>	TokenBad: have you checked the cd for errors?
[neutral]	[04:45]	<Impaque>	xtknight: well, ext3 IS stable as hell, but the speed tradeoff is huge
[neutral]	[04:45]	<pandimus>	ive done that several times
[neutral]	[04:45]	<TokenBad>	type sudo gparted
[negative]	[04:46]	<Ax4>	again, im having a problem with getting my SSL Certificate to work with Ezbounce under Feisty7.0.4, any ideas?
[negative]	[04:46]	<Crazytom>	pandimus, just do lsmod ndiswrapper
[neutral]	[04:46]	<orangey>	hey all!
[neutral]	[04:46]	<pandimus>	its pcmcia
[negative]	[04:46]	<Impaque>	xtknight: and, to mention that xfs has raid-tuning feats
[negative]	[04:46]	<revmischa>	kbidd: have you tried telnetting to the ip address/port from a completely different host
[neutral]	[04:46]	<TokenBad>	Tom47, I am in the installed OS
[neutral]	[04:46]	<chrisjs169|afk>	is the ubuntu torrent server down?  KTorrent is complaining about it being down...
[negative]	[04:46]	<zeroday>	pandimus: Have you tried manually inputting an SSID
[negative]	[04:46]	<wastrel>	what's ezbounce?
[negative]	[04:46]	<xtknight>	Impaque, really?  i thought it was basically the fastest too, with one exception (big files/fragmentation)
[neutral]	[04:46]	<Impaque>	xtknight: like, defining the stripe size and the number of stripes per.. block or sth
[neutral]	[04:46]	<Ax4>	wastrel, bnc software
[negative]	[04:46]	<revmischa>	maybe i should give up and do a clean install from CD
[neutral]	[04:46]	<xtknight>	Impaque, well my /home is XFS and raid0 .  / is ext3 and raid0.   /boot is ext3
[negative]	[04:46]	<Tom47>	TokenBad: yes i understand but did you at any stage check the burn for errors?

[neutral]	[04:47]	<Fujitsu>	!helpme | zazeem
[negative]	[04:47]	<msand>	locke1689: Interesting about it being slower.  Though I admit, it's entirely possible I've never tried azureus on linux, just the Win version.. and Windows has never had download speeds that I get on linux in any application.
[positive]	[04:47]	<ubotu>	zazeem: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative]	[04:47]	<rrittenhouse>	The feisty installer acts like it does not detect my hard drive. When im in the partitioning section it only gives me manual as a choice to partition and if i choose that it doesnt list any partitions in the box?? Anybody know what to do?
[negative]	[04:47]	<zeroday>	zazeem whats ur question

[negative]	[04:54]	<peeps>	i want to upgrade to firefox 2.0, but I think something is wrong with my Ubuntu install.  It says I already have 2.0, but when I run it, it is only 1.5.0.4
[negative]	[04:54]	<xtknight>	dave___, nope vmware runs great here.  do you have the proper linux kernel headers installed?
[neutral]	[04:54]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: within the given guidlines
[neutral]	[04:54]	<refefer>	stknight: any idea how I can go about setting up a widescreen resolution?
[negative]	[04:54]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: For example like Windows default size

[neutral]	[04:54]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: did you go to system -> preferences -> screen reslution?
[negative]	[04:54]	<stelios>	"can anyone explain me what is ""lba"" means( it's under flags tab) the partition which i have vista has boot there and the partition that i want to have ubuntu says lba   ( isee this in gparted)"
[neutral]	[04:55]	<papatwilight>	fiesty

[negative]	[04:55]	<dave___>	yes all are in, im trying to update vmware to the latest right now
[negative]	[04:55]	<xtknight>	stelios, lba is large block addressing or something
[negative]	[04:55]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: what size is your monitor? windows default is 1024x768 normally
[positive]	[04:55]	<peeps>	finch, feisty, but has been upgraded from dapper, to edgy, then to feisty
[positive]	[04:55]	<msand>	peeps, did you compile the older firefox on your own?
[positive]	[04:55]	<refefer>	xtknight: no, my primary: I have a winbox running to it via dvi and it works great
[neutral]	[04:55]	<peeps>	msand, no
[negative]	[04:55]	<xtknight>	stelios, it just means greater than a puny size hard disk.  it's for all modern stuff.  it's all LBA.  if you dont have LBA you have like 4 gig HDs at max or something puny
[negative]	[04:55]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: Is it? Ubuntu seems to big for me
[negative]	[04:55]	<peeps>	locke1689, if i remove it will I lose all configuration?
[negative]	[04:55]	<cotton>	Why is my browser asking me to download .php files if I installed PHP4 and PHP4 along with libapache2-mod-php5 and libapache2-mod-php4
[neutral]	[04:55]	<milardovich>	help me please!

[negative]	[04:56]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: you can resize the bar at the bottom and icons on desktop
[negative]	[04:56]	<locke1689>	peeps: you might, but you can look up where the config files are and back it up
[positive]	[04:56]	<zazeem>	right click on adesktop icon and hit resize

[neutral]	[04:56]	<refefer>	xtknight: using a second system hooked up via the vga port (I would use dvi, but this dell only has vga out)
[neutral]	[04:56]	<jason_>	hi i need help i can go to a java chat room online and it lets me chat for a min the after that it will not let me type any thing
[negative]	[04:56]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: Maybe its becausa I'm used to Windows
[negative]	[04:56]	<finch>	peeps, I'd say uninstall it but it has too many dependencies
[positive]	[04:56]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: probably, ubuntu is much more fun though :)
[neutral]	[04:56]	<xtknight>	stelios, you have to create a partiton there that is ext3
[neutral]	[04:56]	<cotton>	behdad: Is there one simple download I can download to install AMP
[positive]	[04:56]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: i just got off of xp
[positive]	[04:56]	<jason_>	and it does the same in yahoo pool
[negative]	[04:56]	<xtknight>	"stelios, and make the mount point ""/"" if it's root"
[negative]	[04:57]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: i have had ubuntu before
[negative]	[04:57]	<dave___>	so wait is 686 back ?
[negative]	[04:57]	<dave___>	should i use 686 or generic?
[negative]	[04:57]	<bradyc>	Anyone know of a good resource for figuring out resolution problems with nvidia drivers?
[negative]	[04:57]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: I just installed Beryl and I'm amazed
[neutral]	[04:57]	<Impaque>	cotton: LAMP?
[negative]	[04:57]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: had to try feisty fawn
[neutral]	[04:57]	<] Johnny[>	so, whats the best irc client for linux?
[negative]	[04:57]	<finch>	perhaps you have multiple versions installed and just running the wrong one
[neutral]	[04:57]	<Burgundavia>	dave___: they are the same
[positive]	[04:57]	<refefer>	xtknight: I want to thank you in advanced for helping out anyway you can, it sure is nice.
[positive]	[04:57]	<behdad>	towsonu2003: :)) man i have to submit 3 asignments and 2 projects i was going to install 7.04 , thanks god for ur help

[neutral]	[04:57]	<cotton>	Impaque: Doesn't ubuntu come with LAMP?
[negative]	[04:57]	<zazeem>	how do i change my ubuntu main menu image to a custom image?
[negative]	[04:57]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: Don't you know?
[negative]	[04:57]	<stelios>	"xtknight: i have already vista install in another partition? so what i have to do? i mean mount point""/"" or somethinf else?"
[negative]	[04:57]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: not familiar with that
[neutral]	[04:57]	<bradyc>	I can't wait to try beryl on this machine... but I need to get my resolution higher first... 800by600 sucks.
[neutral]	[04:57]	<jughead>	] Johnny[, it depends, a lot of people like xchat, others prefer irssi, and there are a ton of clients out there
[negative]	[04:57]	<xtknight>	refefer, laptop=linux/vga only and computer=windows/dvi only  or am i confused?
[negative]	[04:57]	<towsonu2003>	behdad: hmm, maybe it might be easier for you to use a Live CD, boot Linux, mount /home, install baobab, find files that are big and delete them using the graphical interface / gnome of Live CD
[negative]	[04:58]	<rrittenhouse>	How can I get the feisty installer to ACTUALLY WORK?!
[negative]	[04:58]	<Impaque>	cotton: it does, but there is really piece of cake method to install it by getting ubuntu-server edition
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Fnyar>	zeroday, thanks for the suggestion regarding network-manager, that's certainly what was putting the icon in my system tray. That seems strange that there wouldn't be an option to not display it.
[positive]	[04:58]	<towsonu2003>	behdad, you're welcome :)
[negative]	[04:58]	<rrittenhouse>	How can I get the feisty installer to ACTUALLY WORK?!
[positive]	[04:58]	<Impaque>	"cotton: it has ""Install LAMP server"" option ;)"
[negative]	[04:58]	<refefer>	xtknight: no can do since my dell with ubuntu only has vga out.  I'm trying to get ubuntu to use a widescreen resolution on it
[neutral]	[04:58]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: @HLINK
[negative]	[04:58]	<Crav>	rrittenhouse: what's your problem?
[neutral]	[04:58]	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: you wouldnt happen to know how to change the menu icon would you?
[neutral]	[04:58]	<cotton>	Impaque: HOW HOW HOW
[neutral]	[04:58]	<xtknight>	stelios, you dont mount the vista to /
[positive]	[04:58]	<pandimus>	is there a command to see if ubuntu can see my wireless card? pcmcia, it does not show up on network connections
[neutral]	[04:58]	<xtknight>	stelios, you can mount that to /media/vista
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Shaba1>	Is there some special internet radio player for linux
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Shaba1>	or can I jsut use winamp
[negative]	[04:58]	<stelios>	:( i'm lost
[negative]	[04:58]	<behdad>	cotton: no its not like that , simply go to php.net and read configuration for apache config file , modify them in your apache config file then restart your apache with : sudo apache2 -k restart
[neutral]	[04:58]	<Burgundavia>	Shaba1: rhythmbox can play it
[neutral]	[04:58]	<refefer>	xtknight: heh, this is one of those micro cases and for some bizarre reason they cheaped out on dvi
[negative]	[04:58]	<xtknight>	refefer, ah ok what kind of driver are you using on the dell
[negative]	[04:58]	<jughead>	refefer, are you trying to get widescreen on the vga out or just in general?
[positive]	[04:59]	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: I'm having a first hand experience. Don0t know enough yet
[negative]	[04:59]	<rrittenhouse>	Crav: When installing Ubuntu Feisty - im in the installer and it will not let me get past the partitioning. It acts as if i have no drives on here
[neutral]	[04:59]	<bradyc>	pandimus: iwconfig or ifconfig
[neutral]	[04:59]	<Impaque>	!server
[neutral]	[04:59]	<Burgundavia>	Shaba1: winamp is windows only, hence the win part of the name
[positive]	[04:59]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments, including a server-specific !kernel and no !GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current !LTS version is 6.06. For more info see @HLINK - The #ubuntu-server channel provides specific support

[neutral]	[04:59]	<refefer>	jughead: just in general
[negative]	[04:59]	<msand>	Shaba1: streamtuner does that I think
[negative]	[04:59]	<rrittenhouse>	Crav: It gives me the manual option and i select it and it lists nothing in the box
[neutral]	[04:59]	<xtknight>	dave___, uhh yes
[negative]	[04:59]	<jughead>	Shaba1, I use streamtuner and beep media player for internet radio
[negative]	[04:59]	<bradyc>	as for hardware stuff with PCMCIA, it's something I have no experience with.
[negative]	[04:59]	<xtknight>	dave___, if your kernel version is 2.6.20-15-generic
[positive]	[04:59]	<behdad>	towsonu2003: no way man , as a computer science student it is time to lear before OS subject in next sem ;)
[negative]	[04:59]	<finn>	is there an easy way to update linux-uvc driver in feisty? the one included in the kernel is too old and doesn't work with my webcam?

[negative]	[05:00]	<vox754>	Burgundavia, hey, nice meeting you... I assume somebody is leaking info about the new Ubuntu, hence the topic
[neutral]	[05:00]	<Shaba1>	finn what is uvc

[positive]	[05:00]	<finn>	Shaba1, it's a driver for a number of v4l2 webcams
[positive]	[05:00]	<dave___>	worked fine on edgy
[neutral]	[05:00]	<refefer>	xtknight: since it's an HD monitor, it can do up to 1080i.  Personally, I'd be completely fine with 720p which I believe is 1280x720
[negative]	[05:00]	<xtknight>	dave___, youd have to pastebin the whole log
[neutral]	[05:00]	<finn>	mainly the logitech ones
[negative]	[05:00]	<Burgundavia>	vox754: nah, merely that it doesn't exist in any form that is installable and if you try, you are going to break your computer
[neutral]	[05:00]	<bradyc>	does the interface show up when you run ifconfig?
[neutral]	[05:00]	<dave___>	gotcha

[negative]	[05:01]	<kruncher>	I've got a question. Isnt the network manager in 7.04 supposed to show traffic flowing through it (i.e. graphic changing)?
[neutral]	[05:01]	<refefer>	jughead: it's a dell

[positive]	[05:07]	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, go to synaptic package manager
[neutral]	[05:07]	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, hit the search button

[neutral]	[05:07]	<xtknight>	refefer_, on the linux?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<SnoopyTwo>	BUM ???
[negative]	[05:08]	<NobleCommerc1>	anyone know how to disabled gnome-screensaver from a script without blocking? so i can run another command then re-enable gnomescreensaver when it finishes?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<refefer_>	xtknight: correct
[positive]	[05:08]	<GionnyBoss>	SnoopyTwo: BUM is Boot Up Manager ;)
[negative]	[05:08]	<xtknight>	refefer_, ok so you just need to change the res.  great
[neutral]	[05:08]	<musya>	Drk_Guy: apt-get install java-6
[negative]	[05:08]	<xtknight>	refefer_, what res do you want?
[negative]	[05:08]	<sephi>	hey guys.. i have just used sudo apt-get install firestarter .... why don't i get a icon of the firewall!?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<refefer_>	xtknight: preferably 1280x720
[positive]	[05:08]	<blazemonger>	my ultimate dream: a AmigaOne computer
[neutral]	[05:08]	<xtknight>	"refefer_, just type ""gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"""
[neutral]	[05:08]	<moDumass>	zazeem cool

[negative]	[05:08]	<SnoopyTwo>	interesting....    I didn't see an rny rc1., rc.2, rc.3 directories ....    So I'm kind of lost
[neutral]	[05:08]	<coz_>	sephi, in terminal try  sudo update-menus
[neutral]	[05:08]	<xtknight>	refefer_, you'll see a list of resolutions at the bottom.  it's pretty self explanatory.  there is a section for each bit depth (24bit 8bit etc)
[negative]	[05:09]	<sephi>	tks dude.. i will do it!@
[neutral]	[05:09]	<papatwilight>	why doen't the hsize setting in gconf-editor for compix stay 4 after i set it?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: will my manually installed nvidia drivers break the feisty upgrade?
[negative]	[05:09]	<Drk_Guy>	I do not understand anything
[negative]	[05:09]	<GionnyBoss>	SnoopyTwo: in /etc/init.d/ there are all the scripts to start, stop, restart services
[neutral]	[05:09]	<refefer_>	xtknight: excellent, just what I needed... gonna give it a try
[neutral]	[05:09]	<NBrepresent>	hi, are there any programs for linux that can do a trace bitmap?
[negative]	[05:09]	<musya>	Drk_Guy: what are you trying to do?
[negative]	[05:09]	<bradyc>	killing X, brb
[neutral]	[05:09]	<Drk_Guy>	Install Java 6_u1
[neutral]	[05:09]	<SnoopyTwo>	GionnyBoss:   Thx! for the pointer!
[neutral]	[05:09]	<Drk_Guy>	I have the installer
[neutral]	[05:10]	<sephi>	coz_ man... it has shown that this program doesn't exist
[neutral]	[05:10]	<xtknight>	SnoopyTwo, per-session gnome startup progs are in system->preferences->Sessions
[neutral]	[05:10]	<GionnyBoss>	SnoopyTwo: no problem
[positive]	[05:10]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, well that seems up in the air, i did both an upgrade from edgy to feisty then a complet clen install of feisty, and although if yu upgrade you will have to reinstall the nvidia driver becuse it is a different kernel
[negative]	[05:10]	<Drk_Guy>	But the instructions that page gives me are totally confusing
[positive]	[05:10]	<zak_>	NBrepresent, trace bitmap? if you mean trace a bitmap [ie vectorise it] , inkscape will... but if you mean something else, it's probably not in my brain :)
[neutral]	[05:10]	<lotacus>	guys. does BloGTK support spaces.live.com?
[negative]	[05:10]	<lotacus>	or anyone know an app that will?
[negative]	[05:10]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, also I am not sure the kernel allows the official nvidia driver because even now eachtime I reboot I have to reinstall the nividia driver with feisty which I thought was fixed
[negative]	[05:10]	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon Guys, i need help on this stuff
[neutral]	[05:10]	<JACKBAUER_AL>	Hello girls
[negative]	[05:11]	<JACKBAUER_AL>	how are you?
[neutral]	[05:11]	<musya>	Drk_Guy:  sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-fonts
[negative]	[05:11]	<rrittenhouse>	Drk_Guy: Ive been trying to get help for at least 30 minutes now.. good luck
[negative]	[05:11]	<bradyc>	that didn't work... damn.
[neutral]	[05:11]	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, for java?
[negative]	[05:11]	<NBrepresent>	zak_: no, i did a search and it looks like inkscape will do it. great! thanks.
[negative]	[05:11]	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, so i should hit Ctrl+Alt+F1
[neutral]	[05:11]	<Drk_Guy>	And type that stuff
[neutral]	[05:11]	<finch>	Is gnome-session-manager what starts up programs on login?
[negative]	[05:11]	<linoleum>	hi. guys, do you know a programm similar to Dev c++ underwindos , for the gnome desktop ?
[negative]	[05:11]	<GionnyBoss>	Drk_Guy: why? just open a terminal ... Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
[positive]	[05:11]	<Xk2c>	yes finch
[negative]	[05:12]	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, no open a terminal and copy paste those command in
[neutral]	[05:12]	<Kix>	linoleum: Anjuta
[negative]	[05:12]	<msand>	rrittenhouse: I'm guessing no one's had that problem.  I didn't, personally, so it's hard to give help.  Maybe if you gave details about your drives?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<boss>	linoleum: If you don't mind using KDE tools, KDevelop is nice.
[negative]	[05:12]	<blazemonger>	if any of you have a amiga system with a bit of memory ill trade a dell latitude c640 laptop
[positive]	[05:12]	<finch>	gnome-session-manager depends on the acpi crap for some reason so I can't uninstall those?
[positive]	[05:12]	<xtknight>	universe is enabled by default in feisty?
[positive]	[05:12]	<blazemonger>	that has a ati radeon 7500
[negative]	[05:12]	<kbidd>	Im having trouble with setting up port forwarding to this computer (sorry about the repeat question -- my computer's power cord got pulled after i asked last time) -- it is the DMZ, but applications still report a firewall -- is it possible something in ubuntu is blocking connections?
[negative]	[05:12]	<SnoopyTwo>	One more thing....     What's the best method to manage ipchains/iptabes... etc... FW stuff ?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<nomad111>	hey everyone
[negative]	[05:12]	<Alonea>	ok, if its 'gnome-session' in ubuntu, what is it in kubuntu?
[positive]	[05:12]	<linoleum>	"Kix:  is it a bit too complicated ... I'm just a student I dont need a powerfull IDE. Dev c++ is good because it's ""simple"""
[negative]	[05:13]	<refefer_>	xtknight: hmm, supposedly my resolution is listed in each section... how do I go about selecting it?
[negative]	[05:13]	<xtknight>	why can't i open rpm files with mc?  it says inconsistent extfs archive?
[negative]	[05:13]	<linoleum>	boss: ok I take a look
[neutral]	[05:13]	<nomad111>	i installed 915resolution package for my dell inspiron 6400 to get 1280x800 resolution but its not working
[neutral]	[05:13]	<xtknight>	refefer_, you must restart your X server
[negative]	[05:13]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: thanks. Ok I have an 160GB Western Digital IDE Drive. I have feisty on it now actually but its a messy upgraded version and I just wanted to install a clean install of Fesity. I do have a problem where grub takes like 2 minutes to get through maybe its related IDK?
[negative]	[05:13]	<kbidd>	Alonea, if nobody knows here, try asking in #kubuntu
[negative]	[05:13]	<FireJet>	Can someone please take a look at this for me: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:13]	<sabgenton>	how do i run stuff in the background in bash?
[neutral]	[05:13]	<xtknight>	refefer_, press ctrl alt backspace to terminate everything instantly (youll lose all documents)
[negative]	[05:13]	<Alonea>	kbidd: I did already
[positive]	[05:13]	<xtknight>	refefer_, or you could properly logout or reboot but those aren't as fast/fun ;)
[positive]	[05:13]	<sabgenton>	so i can close the bash sesion and  the comand keeps running
[positive]	[05:13]	<drumline_>	I can't believe Ubuntu did this to my computer.   It can't see the partition on boot and NTDLR is missing on the XP side of things.
[negative]	[05:13]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: Motherboard is D875PBZ just using onboard IDE nothing special
[negative]	[05:13]	<Alonea>	I am trying to read this how to page and its all gnome and I wanted to do it on KDE (its beryl)
[positive]	[05:13]	<Kix>	linoleum: I dont believe it's any more difficult? I've used Dev c++ alot? Kdevlop is a bit much... else you could just use good ol' gedit and the CLI :p
[positive]	[05:14]	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: consider using Eclipse with C plugin... it's easier ;)
[negative]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, i opened the console, i have typed that stuff in, and it is downloading some stufff
[negative]	[05:14]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: i want to just use the restricted device manager in feisty for nvidia drivers, at least until there's a new driver which i *need* in order to get a bug fix (namely when they fix the black windows bug)
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	What now
[negative]	[05:14]	<ardchoille>	"sabgenton: You can try putting a ""&"" on the end of the command (command &) but it doesn't always work."
[neutral]	[05:14]	<refefer_>	"xtknight: I don't think I made myself understandable, but under each subsection for ""screen"" it lists my resolutions for each depth, but doesn't specify which one to use"
[positive]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, oh.  it uses the highest by default i believe.
[negative]	[05:14]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, oh I see well being that the upgrade will be a new kernerl you will probably still have to reinstall that driver
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Drk_Guy>	What now???????
[neutral]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, but you change it with system->prefs->screen resolutions
[neutral]	[05:14]	<xtknight>	refefer_, or ctrl alt PLUS and ctrl alt MINUS
[negative]	[05:15]	<linoleum>	Kix: ok I'm going to give a try with anjuta
[negative]	[05:15]	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, what have you don so far
[negative]	[05:15]	<kbidd>	my computer is rejecting incoming connections -- iptables-save gives an empty output -- any ideas?
[negative]	[05:15]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: how do i uninstall the driver?
[negative]	[05:15]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: im having the same problem as described here @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:15]	<linoleum>	GionnyBoss: I m going to have a look at eclipse too . Tkx
[negative]	[05:15]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, no need to unintsll it
[neutral]	[05:15]	<xtknight>	solved.  mc wasn't opening RPMs because i needed the 'rpm' package.
[negative]	[05:15]	<Drk_Guy>	"I have opened the terminal, copy and pasted ""sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-fonts"" in the terminal and it is downloading some files"
[positive]	[05:15]	<refefer_>	xtknight: the 1280x800 isn't in the screen resolutions selector, only 4:3 resolutions are there
[negative]	[05:15]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  could be the specific service config
[positive]	[05:15]	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: anjuta is similar to kdevelop... consider eclipse with c plugin. I use this for my university. There's a good debugger inside, too :)
[neutral]	[05:15]	<xtknight>	refefer_, yea you have to restart X first
[neutral]	[05:15]	<Drk_Guy>	But i already have the installer
[neutral]	[05:15]	<xtknight>	refefer_, after modifying xorg
[negative]	[05:15]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: i want to before i do the upgrade
[negative]	[05:15]	<xange>	I went through this how-to in order to get beryl workin in feisty and its working with the exception of the screen seeming fuzzy and on the desktop there seems to be some discoloartion going on - @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:15]	<JACKBAUER_AL>	Who uses Debian?
[neutral]	[05:16]	<kbidd>	wastrel, this computer is the DMZ on my network, and several apps are complaining of a firewall.
[negative]	[05:16]	<Pie-rate>	JACKBAUER_AL: no one.
[negative]	[05:16]	<Possum>	How can I check if an Ubuntu CD has errors or not without rebooting and running the CD check?
[negative]	[05:16]	<zack>	hello guys, one quick question im looking for a deskapp that looks like the default one in DSL linux, its all txt and quite large anyone know what its called?
[negative]	[05:16]	<Pie-rate>	JACKBAUER_AL: well, hardcore RMS wannabes, i guess.
[negative]	[05:16]	<captaintrips>	damnit, i cant get java working
[negative]	[05:16]	<fantasia>	cd with errors?
[negative]	[05:16]	<Possum>	It might have errors, I don't know
[negative]	[05:16]	<xtknight>	yeah noone uses debian anymore
[negative]	[05:16]	<kbidd>	i use debian
[neutral]	[05:16]	<carlhempel>	lol
[negative]	[05:17]	<fantasia>	you say md5 check failed?
[negative]	[05:17]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, ok let me see if i can remember the command to uninstalll it
[neutral]	[05:17]	<Possum>	A Feisty Cd
[negative]	[05:17]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  so you can't connect to the ubuntu machine in the DMZ from clients on the LAN?
[negative]	[05:17]	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, i think i will leave it downloading those files
[negative]	[05:17]	<msand>	rrittenhouse: Beats me, sorry.  I have a WD 160 GB IDE drive and no problems with Feisty seeing it.
[neutral]	[05:17]	<sabgenton>	ardchoille: yes i rember doing that now
[positive]	[05:17]	<linoleum>	GionnyBoss: tkx mate I definitly going to try this one too :)
[negative]	[05:17]	<zak_>	Possum: you could *probably* run an md5 checksum on /dev/cdrom, and compare it with an md5 checksum recorded on the ubuntu download page [assuming they're put up there] ... someone should be able to help you out
[neutral]	[05:17]	<Possum>	fantasia, Not exactly getting it... the iso is fine
[positive]	[05:17]	<Drk_Guy>	Ciao friends, and thanks for everything
[neutral]	[05:17]	<captaintrips>	ln: creating hard link `./libjavaplugin_oji.so' to `/usr/java/jre1.6.0_01/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so': File exists... why wont it work? still says i need to install it on firefox
[neutral]	[05:17]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, try this   sudo /usr/bin/nvidia-installer --uninstall
[positive]	[05:17]	<bradyc>	msand: same here.  I've got all kinds of drives that work just fine.
[neutral]	[05:17]	<Pie-rate>	coz_: found it
[negative]	[05:17]	<refefer_>	xtknight: no such luck, I just reset X and the resolution isn't there
[negative]	[05:17]	<captaintrips>	oh, nvm
[neutral]	[05:17]	<captaintrips>	now i c
[negative]	[05:17]	<Possum>	zak_, okay, lemme check
[neutral]	[05:17]	<kbidd>	westrel, no, connections from the outside the network arent getting to my computer even though its the DMZ.
[negative]	[05:17]	<aubade>	xtknight: I do. :(
[negative]	[05:17]	<sabgenton>	ardchoille: the other way is to use screen but i want a bash soultion
[negative]	[05:17]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: Alright. As i was saying I had other problems where grub takes like 2-3 minutes just to get through. Maybe that has something to do with it? Im not sure... thanks for your help
[negative]	[05:17]	<xtknight>	refefer_, pastebin your xorg.conf please
[neutral]	[05:17]	<Josesordo>	how to install kiba-dock??
[neutral]	[05:17]	<xtknight>	!pastebin | refefer_

[positive]	[05:17]	<bradyc>	refefer_: having resolution issues too when using the nvidia driver :-(
[neutral]	[05:18]	<captaintrips>	i think
[neutral]	[05:18]	<captaintrips>	lol
[positive]	[05:18]	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: no problem. Just remember that Eclipse on his own is for Java only. You have to install C plugin to develop C apps.
[neutral]	[05:18]	<konam>	hi
[neutral]	[05:18]	<finch>	lots of people having nvidia res problems, including me
[negative]	[05:18]	<msand>	rrittenhouse: Something flaky with the drive maybe?  Sorry I couldn't help more.
[negative]	[05:18]	<konam>	someone have monkeymessenger installed on feisty?
[neutral]	[05:18]	<xtknight>	gksu nvidia-settings
[negative]	[05:18]	<xtknight>	and use save to x config
[neutral]	[05:18]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  can you ping it from outside?
[negative]	[05:18]	<xange>	does anybody have any suggestions for getting my nvidia card to work right?
[neutral]	[05:18]	<zak_>	heh, i'm surprised... i just installed office 2000 with wine, and it seems to work fine, with some minor ui glitches [mostly in the installer] 
[negative]	[05:18]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: its all good. yeah im not too sure whats up with it. It just seems ubuntu isnt seeing the drive..
[neutral]	[05:18]	<coz_>	xange, which nvidia card do you have?
[positive]	[05:18]	<linoleum>	GionnyBoss: yes I m on the website right now.

[negative]	[05:19]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: I have feisty ON the HDD but I had a problem booting in -14 and -15 kernels it would drop me to busybox. This is running -15 maybe thats the issue and its not finding my drive
[negative]	[05:19]	<coz_>	Pie-rate, yeah they work
[negative]	[05:19]	<xtknight>	"refefer_, additionally pastebin the output of ""xrandr -q"".  are you sure you reset you X server because i never saw you quit"

[negative]	[05:19]	<xtknight>	refefer_, your whole desktop would have reloaded/etc
[negative]	[05:19]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  what protocols are you serving?
[negative]	[05:19]	<cotton>	Can someone explain this: @HLINK
[positive]	[05:20]	<xange>	coz_: yeah, its running...I get the splash screen but gnome is blurry as crap
[negative]	[05:20]	<refefer_>	xtknight: very sure, my screen went blank and had to relog in after X restarted
[negative]	[05:20]	<xtknight>	refefer_, ah hmm ok pastebin the above items i'll check them
[neutral]	[05:20]	<refefer_>	xtknight: used the X restart keys : )
[negative]	[05:20]	<verma>	hey people .. there was this emulation program that could let me logon to my own system in a different x session ... like in a window like vnc ... anybody know what that's called .. xemu or something?
[negative]	[05:20]	<msand>	rrittenhouse: Maybe.  Feisty's not on my WD drive, though it used to be.

[neutral]	[05:21]	<rrittenhouse>	msand: thx
[negative]	[05:21]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: what's your problem? can't you use the resolution you want?
[negative]	[05:21]	<refefer_>	GionnyBoss: no, for some reason I can't : (
[neutral]	[05:22]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: what can't you do?
[negative]	[05:22]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: ah ok... I have the solution

[positive]	[05:23]	<refefer_>	GionnyBoss: troubles with i810 intel driver?
[neutral]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: this solved the problem for me on my laptop with intel integrated graphic card... there's a bug that doesn't let you use different resolution, untill you install this 915resolution package and configure it
[negative]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: yeah
[neutral]	[05:23]	<kbidd>	wastrel, I just tried localhost, it works, and then from the LAN, and that failed.
[negative]	[05:23]	<xtknight>	GionnyBoss, why i810 doesnt let you set the res in xrog ?
[negative]	[05:23]	<GionnyBoss>	xtknight: it's not a i810 problem... it's some intel chipset problem
[negative]	[05:23]	<Alonea>	"also, how do you add a script to your ""Session Startup Programs"" list in Kubuntu?"
[neutral]	[05:23]	<xtknight>	!kubuntu

[neutral]	[05:24]	<wastrel>	kbidd:  check hosts.allow and .deny
[negative]	[05:24]	<xtknight>	refefer_, well odd.  it must be a bug, maybe you do need the 915resolution thing
[negative]	[05:24]	<GionnyBoss>	"xtknight, refefer_ : with my Dell laptop, I had to install this 915resolution. The chipset has got a bug that ""tells"" that he can only display some resolution, while in reality he can display more resolutions than those"

[negative]	[05:42]	<xtknight>	xange, well the force gpu scaling setting is permanent, no xorg mod needed so i guess you're good to go on that front.  i'd still be curious as to why that fixed it.  as i said if frontend/backend are different then somehow you're not using the native
[neutral]	[05:42]	<xtknight>	xange, same place as force gpu
[neutral]	[05:43]	<xange>	xtknight: they match the native

[negative]	[05:44]	<noelferreira>	peeps: i need to find this file dvb-ttpci-01.fw in my entire system. what would be the command?
[negative]	[05:44]	<xange>	xtknight: yeah
[neutral]	[05:44]	<GionnyBoss>	"bobesponja: you should have for all xserver settings the current value, so if you hit ""enter"" key you just leave the current setting for that thing. When it asks for mouse, be sure that it's setted right"
[positive]	[05:44]	<Doughy>	I think Beryl overwrote some of my gnome settings and now I am having re-login problems.  Does anyone know how I can re-install gnome to reset my config files without losing anything?
[negative]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, well that's very odd. oh well, must be a bug
[negative]	[05:44]	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, did you try #edubuntu ? people there are more likely to have used it
[negative]	[05:44]	<pipegeek>	Hi, folks.  Just had a quick question about a bit of weirdness in the version of gnome that ships with feisty, and I'm wondering if anyone can reproduce it.  The panel trash bin doesn't seem to respond to being full, on a new, clean install.  That is, it doesn't matter whether there's anything in the trash; the bin always appears empty, and so can't be emptied, except by actually opening the trash and emptying it from the resulting nautilus w
[neutral]	[05:44]	<pipegeek>	indow.  Can anyone confirm this?
[neutral]	[05:44]	<peeps>	noelferreira, sudo find / -name dvb-ttpci-01.fw
[negative]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, oh woops i should be asking you to compare frontend/backend and native, not frontend TO backend
[neutral]	[05:44]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I've tested edubuntu & ubuntu, the result is the same
[negative]	[05:44]	<xtknight>	xange, ideally they should all be the same under force gpu and no force gpu
[neutral]	[05:44]	<peeps>	noelferreira, or use iname.  the difference is that iname is case insensitive
[positive]	[05:44]	<xange>	xtknight: i dunno, I have a Samsung Syncmaster 930b if that means anything to you :)
[neutral]	[05:45]	<xtknight>	xange, definitely does..  1280x1024@60Hz would be native for that
[negative]	[05:45]	<Cosmo_>	"I was attempting to upgrade my mother's laptop from 6.10 to 7.04 and I am not sure what she did but when I boot up now on it it goes to the command line and says ""/bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off"" any way to fix this?"
[negative]	[05:45]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I mean 7.04
[negative]	[05:45]	<GionnyBoss>	"thebillywayne: yeah. You have to be sure that you configured it correctly and then you have to be sure that 915resolution it's booted on system boot. Use ""bum"" (sudo apt-get install bum), Boot Up Manager, and be sure that from bum you select 915resolution to start on boot"
[neutral]	[05:45]	<xange>	xtknight: all three are the same
[negative]	[05:45]	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: ok I guess I need to restart X
[positive]	[05:45]	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, i know, but the edubuntu folks will have used ltsp more than most people in here, hence will likely know more
[negative]	[05:45]	<pipegeek>	This isn't true of the desktop trash icon, which can be enabled by editing gconf.
[negative]	[05:45]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: yeah
[positive]	[05:45]	<xtknight>	xange, yup must be a bug.  oh well, it's just your lucky day that you found that fix ;P
[negative]	[05:45]	<xange>	xtknight: no matter if I have force full on are off
[negative]	[05:45]	<Zaehlas>	Hello all, I've been trying to get sound working for multiple applications at once (namely teamspeak and cedega), however, in all my furustrations, switching from alsa, to OSS 4.0 and now back, a seem to have partially destroyed my linux headers.  I've tried using apt-get to --purge remove and then install again, but I can't make anything right now.  How do I restore the linux headers?
[negative]	[05:45]	<xtknight>	xange, if youre feeling ambitious maybe file a bug with nvidia?
[positive]	[05:45]	<xange>	xtknight: guess so :-D
[negative]	[05:45]	<wastrel>	pipegeek:  try removing and re-adding the trash applet to the panel
[negative]	[05:45]	<Kazol>	how do I change the color of the font in the bottom panel?
[positive]	[05:45]	<xange>	xtknight: if you give me a link..sure :)
[positive]	[05:45]	<wastrel>	pipegeek:  mine works fine
[negative]	[05:46]	<xtknight>	xange, haha too lazy
[neutral]	[05:46]	<GaiaX11>	!gutsy
[positive]	[05:46]	<ubotu>	Gutsy Gibbon is the code name for the next release of Ubuntu (7.10). See @HLINK and @HLINK Support in #ubuntu+1
[positive]	[05:46]	<pipegeek>	wastrel: already did.  Twice :^)
[neutral]	[05:46]	<xtknight>	xange, naw hold on
[positive]	[05:46]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: yes, edubuntu is easy to setup ltsp, I found ubuntu do easy to install
[negative]	[05:46]	<thebillywayne>	thx GionnyBoss, i'll try that.
[negative]	[05:46]	<xtknight>	xange, there is actually an Xorg  setting for the GPU scaling too.. though that box in nvidia-settings should be permanent. it must write to another file
[negative]	[05:46]	<Pie-rate>	Zaehlas: linux sound systems are a bitch, eh?
[negative]	[05:46]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I'm using edubuntu now, the ltsp terminal still not allow me to login
[positive]	[05:47]	<Zaehlas>	Pie-rate YES!  =D
[neutral]	[05:47]	<xange>	yay. beryl is dope!
[positive]	[05:47]	<Doughy>	I think Beryl overwrote some of my gnome settings and now I am having re-login problems.  Does anyone know how I can re-install gnome to reset my config files without losing anything?
[positive]	[05:47]	<Doughy>	no beryl sucks
[negative]	[05:47]	<GionnyBoss>	"thebillywayne: it's not easy to configure this 915resolution... I lost a lot of time doing it. For example I setted my 1440x900 resolution of the list (that it was a number, something like 4c) as 640x480. And then just added ""640x480"" in my xorg.conf. After this, for 640x480 the x server will see 1440x900 instead"
[neutral]	[05:47]	<filch>	heh
[neutral]	[05:47]	<Doughy>	overwrote my configs and now my gnome is hosed
[neutral]	[05:47]	<peeps>	what is ltsp?
[neutral]	[05:47]	<yashton>	Zaehlas: yeah, sound has been very tough in all linux distros. Hopefully ubuntu studio will do some better kernel/driver things.
[negative]	[05:47]	<yell8w>	hey folks, i check my router, firewall and sshd. all are open/running, and still i can't access using the public ip (everything's fine with the local ip ) what should i do ?
[negative]	[05:47]	<ReePigBree>	I can not freshclam in the terminal! :(
[neutral]	[05:47]	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, what i'm saying is the people in #edubuntu will probably be *more likely* to know the answer to your problem
[negative]	[05:47]	<pipegeek>	Anyone else?  Just curious
[neutral]	[05:47]	<peeps>	noelferreira, did that find it?
[negative]	[05:47]	<Doughy>	Beryl = garbage until they get some stability
[negative]	[05:47]	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu, ohh hahaha I'm in wrong channel, thanks
[neutral]	[05:47]	<cobrien>	How would I restart my mouse daemon?

[positive]	[05:48]	<cobrien>	My mouse cursor disappeared after unsuccessfully loading beryl.
[positive]	[05:48]	<xtknight>	xange, and that command will work even on restricted drivers

[negative]	[05:48]	<Zaehlas>	yashton: Well, technically my current problem isn't sound, but compiling anything on my system cause I trashed my linux headers.  what do I do to completely restore them?   using apt-get to remove then install again is NOT resoring the files I'm missing apparently.
[negative]	[05:48]	<thebillywayne>	GionnyBoss, so you set one for the other?
[negative]	[05:48]	<yell8w>	filch, i'm looking at the router port forwarding page
[positive]	[05:48]	<noelferreira>	thanks peeps
[neutral]	[05:48]	<noelferreira>	yes peeps
[neutral]	[05:48]	<peeps>	yw
[negative]	[05:49]	<filch>	yell8w: do you see anything in the log on the linux box you're trying to hit?
[neutral]	[05:49]	<james296>	how can I change my Ubuntu boot screen back to its default after getting KDE?
[neutral]	[05:49]	<xange>	xtknight: k, I'll take care of that right now
[positive]	[05:49]	<xtknight>	xange, thanks for taking the time
[negative]	[05:49]	<yashton>	zaehlas: linux headers should be fixed with apt-get, not sure why that would be a problem. when in doubt do a clean install of it. *Shrug*

[neutral]	[05:49]	<yell8w>	filch, heh, didn't think of that, one sec
[negative]	[05:49]	<blazemonger>	do u think the reason the4 molecule saver froze was cuz i didnt have a custom kernel?
[negative]	[05:50]	<james296>	wherre do I go to remember that?
[neutral]	[05:50]	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: still the same
[positive]	[05:50]	<wastrel>	blazemonger:  i think it's because you don't have 3d acceleration set up

[positive]	[05:50]	<blazemonger>	and i was told it supported opengl
[negative]	[05:50]	<binskipy2u>	hey can someone tell me if they got VIRTUALBOX to work on ubuntu and/or if its in the repos?
[neutral]	[05:50]	<blazemonger>	so i have to buy a new video card?
[negative]	[05:50]	<GionnyBoss>	thebillywayne: yeah the idea was like that... I discovered this after trying a lot. Unfortunately I don't have my laptop here now to check it (my father has got it now)
[neutral]	[05:50]	<xtknight>	yashton, sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
[neutral]	[05:50]	<yashton>	burgundavia: thanks no links on the website for that.
[positive]	[05:50]	<boss>	Hmm, this is definitely a bug.
[negative]	[05:50]	<MTecknology>	Is there an update for vmware server so that I can update to 7.04?
[neutral]	[05:50]	<blazemonger>	man no wonder im starting to hate pc's
[neutral]	[05:50]	<yashton>	exit
[negative]	[05:51]	<blazemonger>	nothing will run properly on my hardware
[negative]	[05:51]	<boss>	@HLINK -> that kickstart configuration snippet is supposed to get the root filesystem and its underlings to format properly.
[negative]	[05:51]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: that's strange. The mouse is set as 3 buttons mouse? I told you to do this thing just to check that in xorg conf the mouse was setted as 3 buttons mouse
[negative]	[05:51]	<wil_syd>	Anyone using mt-daapd ? Which has to start first.. avahi or mt-daapd ?
[neutral]	[05:51]	<binskipy2u>	anyone here using virtualbox in fiesty?
[positive]	[05:51]	<boss>	However, with the Ubuntu alternate install CD providing the ks option the appropriate path seems to work for everything but partitioning.
[neutral]	[05:51]	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: i did select the 3 buttons mouse option
[negative]	[05:52]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	What's the trick to making the tty login work?
[negative]	[05:52]	<boss>	"It gets a ""No root filesystem defined"" error and I can't define a root filesystem because Ubuntu seems to recurse back to that error."
[neutral]	[05:52]	<testingltsp>	anybody success with ubuntu 7.04 with LTSP5?
[neutral]	[05:52]	<testingltsp>	anybody success with ubuntu 7.04 + LTSP5?
[negative]	[05:52]	<boss>	If anyone else has seen this error, *please* let me know so that I can report it as a bug to Launchpa.d
[negative]	[05:52]	<peeps>	binskipy2u, I have used virtualbox on Fedora Core 5, but not Ubuntu. I couldn't get it to compile from source, and just ended up installing the binary package from the Virtualboc website
[neutral]	[05:52]	<boss>	Launchpad even.
[negative]	[05:52]	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: plus, before I did the upgrade to feisty it used to work with edgy and I didn't touch my xorg.conf during the upgrade so I guess it's more a driver problem or something no?
[negative]	[05:52]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: ok so at least now we now that this is correct. Unfortunately I don't know what else you should check.
[negative]	[05:53]	<reubs>	I'm  trying to get hyperthreading going on my p4.... any takers?
[negative]	[05:53]	<blazemonger>	i was told that a radeon 7000 PCI would make my system 30% slower than a ATI Rage 128 card
[negative]	[05:53]	<xtknight>	boss, even if only you are having the problem just report it anyway.  it could be a problem with your particular system config and the people on launchpad will take care of it
[negative]	[05:53]	<bradyc>	yeah, I'm having this problem: @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:53]	<bradyc>	I'm glad I'm not the only one.
[neutral]	[05:53]	<JACKBAUER_AL>	Unix bsd Users?
[negative]	[05:53]	<xtknight>	reubs, HT should be enabled on an smp/SMT or generic kernel
[neutral]	[05:53]	<blazemonger>	compiz/beryl wont even run with my rage 128
[neutral]	[05:53]	<concept10>	reubs, hyperthreading is disabled in the ubuntu kernel
[negative]	[05:53]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: I don't know what it could be, really. I thought that it was a xorg.conf configuration problem. Unfortunately I don't have other idea... try to say your problem again here and wait for other people's help. Sorry. Good luck!
[neutral]	[05:54]	<xtknight>	concept10, per what?
[negative]	[05:54]	<yell8w>	filch, funny thing is, i can't even ping the public ip ? #_#
[positive]	[05:54]	<taggie>	blazemonger, i'm using a radeon 7000, it's no gaming machine, but it's a great desktop and supports compiz
[negative]	[05:54]	<reubs>	xtknight: so i have to get the generic kernel and it should be good?
[neutral]	[05:54]	<concept10>	xtknight, per look at the config
[positive]	[05:54]	<reubs>	thanks concept10
[neutral]	[05:54]	<bradyc>	bobesponja: nvidia restricted and only 800x600?
[negative]	[05:54]	<xtknight>	reubs, as far as i can tell that should be the case

[neutral]	[05:55]	<boss>	This error is very close to what I'm getting but not quite it.
[neutral]	[05:55]	<boss>	It's labeled as medium priority: @HLINK
[positive]	[05:55]	<yell8w>	filch, ssh works fine with the 192.168x ips, not the other one
[negative]	[05:55]	<concept10>	xtknight, it hasnt been build with ht enabled for at least 1.5 years or more
[negative]	[05:55]	<bradyc>	bobesponja: np sorry.
[negative]	[05:55]	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure how it is possible to exclude HT ?
[negative]	[05:55]	<xtknight>	concept10, whats the config option name?
[negative]	[05:56]	<boss>	medium priority bug confirmed yet not assigned to anyone :\
[negative]	[05:56]	<bradyc>	I'm running both cores on an AMD64... not sure about HT though.
[positive]	[05:56]	<concept10>	xtknight, i dont know, you have to find it
[neutral]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	amd64 doesnt have HT
[neutral]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	concept10, HT is a bios and cpu level thing
[negative]	[05:56]	<bradyc>	yes, I know that.
[negative]	[05:56]	<xtknight>	concept10, windows 2k can use it without any updates, etc
[negative]	[05:56]	<filch>	yell8w: but if you're coming from one of the internal addresses on that subnet, and you're trying to hit the public ip of the router, the router may be doing something weird cuz it sees you coming from within the network, and not as a true external connection
[negative]	[05:56]	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: that options looks right. Try to ask here again first... I'm a normal user like you, and I just tried to help... guess there could be more expert people here that can help you
[neutral]	[05:56]	<acidtabs>	Can anyone help me install sauerbraten plz
[negative]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	concept10, HT appears to the OS as a dual CPU config nothing more nothing less
[positive]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	thus an smp kernel will work
[negative]	[05:57]	<yell8w>	filch, so it's my router's acting up? i mean i'm getting internet and stuff
[negative]	[05:57]	<yell8w>	that's how i'm talking to you
[neutral]	[05:57]	<concept10>	xtknight, it doesnt
[neutral]	[05:57]	<Cosmo_>	anyone have a link to the 7.04 desktop torrent ?
[neutral]	[05:57]	<xtknight>	"there are some mentions of needing to type ""ht=on"" at the kernel boot line"
[negative]	[05:57]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: it should be so easy using sauerbraten... just extract the archive and launch it, if I remember right
[negative]	[05:57]	<xange>	xtknight: ok, send the e-mail out for ya...I'm going to go take advantage of beryl...enjoy your right and thanks again

[positive]	[05:58]	<braveheartlion>	i've just burned a ubuntu iso onto a cd. how can i check whether the burn is perfect?
[neutral]	[05:58]	<concept10>	xtknight, therefore its not enabled by default
[positive]	[05:58]	<xiambax>	does the new release support intel based macs?
[negative]	[05:58]	<yell8w>	filch, also, i have an apache running, doesn't see it
[neutral]	[05:58]	<acidtabs>	i did try to run the game after extracting it but it does not want to start
[neutral]	[05:58]	<bradyc>	braveheartlion: boot the CD and run the checker util
[neutral]	[05:58]	<Lgndryh1>	hi.....how is everyone
[negative]	[05:58]	<bradyc>	or actually you can open it in windows too IIRC
[negative]	[05:58]	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure about feisty though
[negative]	[05:59]	<filch>	yell8w: with port forwarding, if a connection to the external ip is initiated from a private address behind the router/firewall doing the forwarding, it tends not to work, as its expecting the connection to come from outside the network, not initiated from an address on it's private network. to test this you'd want someone on the outside to try to hit the ip on the specified ports
[negative]	[05:59]	<phixnay>	I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
[negative]	[05:59]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	In Edgy, all I did was post my name and password at the tty prompt and I got into that level,  Feisty isn't letting me in though with that procedure, anyone have an idea of what to do?
[negative]	[05:59]	<fizz_>	guys just installed 7.04, no MP3 will play, where can codecs for noatun etc.
[negative]	[05:59]	<xtknight>	concept10, it must only be ubuntu that is like that because i have had a P4 cpu and it was detectd SMP just fine under suse, etc
[positive]	[05:59]	<filch>	yell8w: i've seen this with firewalls i use at work for various things
[negative]	[05:59]	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro
[neutral]	[05:59]	<jrib>	fizz_: did you try double clicking on an mp3?
[negative]	[05:59]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: so it's not a sauerbraten installation problem... can you paste in pastebin the error output you get, please?
[neutral]	[05:59]	<jrib>	fizz_: (in nautilus)
[neutral]	[05:59]	<bradyc>	fizz, check out the multimedia forums on the ubuntu site, there is a sticky on that subject.
[neutral]	[05:59]	<fizz_>	jrd, will do that now
[neutral]	[05:59]	<fania>	hai
[neutral]	[05:59]	<yell8w>	filch, pm ?
[negative]	[06:00]	<concept10>	xtknight, that maybe the case, but not in ubuntu.  Some people disable HT because in some cases, it may reduce performance.
[negative]	[06:00]	<xtknight>	reubs, place ht=on at the boot line to make sure you have hyperthreading
[negative]	[06:00]	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro.....I am currently at 6.10
[negative]	[06:00]	<acidtabs>	gionnyboss there is no error when i click run it just closes
[neutral]	[06:00]	<chainer827>	hello....I cannot install software currently on ubuntu....keeps giving me an error....can anyone help me solve this?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<phixnay>	what software?
[positive]	[06:01]	<braveheartlion>	bradyc: thank you very much.
[negative]	[06:01]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: open a terminal and try to start it from a terminal. There you should have some error output
[negative]	[06:01]	<reubs>	xtknight: yah, i had already done that but i was looking thro the logs and saw it was refusing to see the next one. is it worth compling my own kernel?
[negative]	[06:01]	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of the text at the bottom panel??
[negative]	[06:01]	<acidtabs>	let me check
[negative]	[06:01]	<xtknight>	reubs, hmm maybe.  the kernel must be deliberately disabling HT, to which i'm very surprised
[negative]	[06:01]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: cd /path/to/your/sauerbraten/folder     and then:  ./sauerbraten
[negative]	[06:02]	<xtknight>	reubs, so i'm not even sure a recompiled kernel would work either.
[negative]	[06:02]	<phixnay>	Hey, I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
[negative]	[06:02]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: uhm, sorry... ./sauerbraten_unix
[negative]	[06:02]	<linoleum_>	ok I 've got a simple question : I search of an IDE. I found Geany, which is new (less than 1 year of development), and I found it on synaptic ... but then I found OpenLDev , and I wanted to install it with synaptic. but I can't find this one. that s strange because it's a 2year and half project, and they finaly reached the 1.0 version . Why can't I find it with synaptic ?
[neutral]	[06:02]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Does anyone know how to crack open a tty prompt in Feisty?
[negative]	[06:02]	<Kazol>	Does anyone here know howto change the color of the text at the bottom table?
[neutral]	[06:02]	<Lathiat>	wil_syd: avahi
[negative]	[06:02]	<xtknight>	reubs, but give it a try. i swear my P4 HT was SMP when i had one...but i never did try ubuntu linux, only other distros like suse
[positive]	[06:02]	<concept10>	xtknight, you shouldnt be surprised.  I told you in some cases HT reduces performance.  Also, HT is not the same as SMP
[negative]	[06:02]	<acidtabs>	i click on display and it pop up with something
[neutral]	[06:02]	<mhykgyver>	hello everyone
[negative]	[06:02]	<acidtabs>	i guess these are errors
[neutral]	[06:03]	<mhykgyver>	ubuntu newbie here
[positive]	[06:03]	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: thanks
[positive]	[06:03]	<reubs>	xtknight: thanks alot tho :) i think its disabled by default as the hyperthreading is a security risk
[negative]	[06:03]	<chainer827>	I can't access synaptic anymore...or remove and install software on feisty....need some help
[negative]	[06:03]	<phixnay>	linoleum_: beats me. try just searching for Open. you can always download a package of it somewhere
[negative]	[06:03]	<xtknight>	reubs, ya i guess
[neutral]	[06:03]	<acidtabs>	its on my desktop
[neutral]	[06:03]	<Shaba1>	guys
[neutral]	[06:03]	<Shaba1>	how do I check my sound system
[neutral]	[06:03]	<Drk_Guy>	Hy
[negative]	[06:03]	<phixnay>	chainer827: why not?
[neutral]	[06:03]	<acidtabs>	how would i do that if its located on my desktop BOss
[negative]	[06:03]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: on display? where? you don't have to click anywere. Just open a terminal and try to start the game from there
[negative]	[06:03]	<bullgard4>	Using ysm I could send a message to my friend but could not receive one. What prerequisite did I not meet?
[negative]	[06:03]	<Alonea>	ok, my adept/apt whatever is messed up. I can do apt-get update and thats it.
[neutral]	[06:03]	<mhykgyver>	uhmmm i hope u won't mind me asking but how can i install glib in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[06:03]	<Drk_Guy>	I am still unable of installing Java
[negative]	[06:04]	<Shaba1>	all of a sudden I am not getting any audio on dvds or screen cast in xubuntu
[neutral]	[06:04]	<chainer827>	I installed the Ubuntu Wireless support software, and it basically made it crash
[neutral]	[06:04]	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of system font?
[negative]	[06:04]	<acidtabs>	i tryed to open terminal but it just closes up just like run
[negative]	[06:04]	<Alonea>	if I try to install something I get E: Invalid record in the preferences file, no Package header
[neutral]	[06:04]	<acidtabs>	did
[negative]	[06:04]	<phixnay>	chainer827: so what can you do now? can you login?
[neutral]	[06:04]	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: just noted in Feisty Avahi is S50 and mt-daapd is S20
[negative]	[06:04]	<chainer827>	yes....on my computer now....just can't install, upgrade, or uninstall software
[positive]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: do you have 3d drivers installed and configured correctly for your graphic card? and then be sure that you installed SDL :)
[negative]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	my grafics are installed whats sdl?
[negative]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	and how would i get it
[positive]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: sdl library is fundamental to run this game
[neutral]	[06:05]	<acidtabs>	ic
[negative]	[06:05]	<GionnyBoss>	"acidtabs: don't remember exactly the name... search in Synaptic for packages like ""SDL"" or ""libsdl"" and install them"
[negative]	[06:06]	<phixnay>	"chainer827: alright, I'm not a pro at linux or anything... but try opening a terminal, and doing ""sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade"""
[neutral]	[06:06]	<newuser>	hello
[neutral]	[06:06]	<phixnay>	hi
[positive]	[06:06]	<newuser>	iam having trouble with usplash ; has anyone had success with installing usplash on kubuntu 7.04
[positive]	[06:06]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: a lot of games for linux (sauerbraten included) use sdl libraries
[negative]	[06:06]	<chainer827>	yeah...tried those....it gives me an error message saying Dynamic MMap ran out of room
[negative]	[06:07]	<phixnay>	chainer827: whoa, I have no idea what that means
[negative]	[06:07]	<acidtabs>	with one should i download thats tons of them
[negative]	[06:07]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	I agree that tty is invaluable to editing files in certain cases and it is in Ubuntu so it should work.  :\
[neutral]	[06:07]	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?
[negative]	[06:07]	<peeps>	chainer827, how much ram do you have?
[negative]	[06:07]	<acidtabs>	i just don't want to install something that would mess my system up
[negative]	[06:07]	<chainer827>	I have 1.5 GB Ram
[neutral]	[06:07]	<phixnay>	0.o
[neutral]	[06:07]	<CactusDeity>	hi
[negative]	[06:07]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: why should a library mess up your system? :S
[neutral]	[06:08]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: go and search on google what a library is
[positive]	[06:08]	<EnsignRedshirt>	linoleum_: The openldev download page has an ubuntu .deb file.
[neutral]	[06:08]	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: if you don't trust me, go and search there
[negative]	[06:08]	<acidtabs>	ill try to install some and see
[neutral]	[06:08]	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?
[neutral]	[06:09]	<phixnay>	chainer827: what happens when you try to use synaptic or update manager?
[negative]	[06:09]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: effecting? what do you exactly mean?
[positive]	[06:09]	<Alonea>	E: Invalid record in the preferences file, no Package header...using apt-get and adept
[neutral]	[06:09]	<Shaba1>	Hello
[neutral]	[06:09]	<Shaba1>	how do I check my sound system
[neutral]	[06:09]	<chainer827>	i keep getting an error message with that saying error occurred while using xcal
[negative]	[06:09]	<Shaba1>	all of a sudden I am not getting any audio on dvds or screen cast in xubuntu
[negative]	[06:09]	<linoleum_>	EnsignRedshirt: yes I know , I just wonder why it's not in the repository (universe or multiverse)
[neutral]	[06:10]	<peeps>	Shaba1, can you get sound in any programs?
[positive]	[06:10]	<phixnay>	shaba1: if you had to manually install kernel modules to get sound to work, you have to install them again each time you upgrade your kernel
[neutral]	[06:10]	<cesar_>	hello
[neutral]	[06:10]	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of system font?
[neutral]	[06:10]	<cesar_>	i have just updated my ubuntu to the new version
[neutral]	[06:10]	<Shaba1>	phixnayI hafe not done any kernal upgrades
[neutral]	[06:11]	<cesar_>	does anyone know why my device hard drive names have changed from /dev/hda1 or /dev/hda2 to /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2??
[negative]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	I hardly know whta the linux keral is
[neutral]	[06:11]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, hahahaa
[negative]	[06:11]	<tankcat>	i'm feeling adventerous. someone suggests a cool windows manager i should try
[negative]	[06:11]	<concept10>	xtknight, check this out, I have a couple of systems with p4 HT @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	all I have recently done is install camaoram
[neutral]	[06:11]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	nice one
[neutral]	[06:11]	<xjkx>	whats the similar to adept-installer that COMES BY DEFAULT on ubuntu?
[positive]	[06:11]	<bradyc>	cesar_: SATA drives will be seen as SDA
[neutral]	[06:11]	<peeps>	cesar_, did you swap your cables around recently?
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	and that sound was working even after I installed that
[negative]	[06:11]	<phixnay>	chainer827: try running top to see if you have anything using up resources, or if there's anything else shifty going on
[positive]	[06:11]	<Shaba1>	but now it seems not to work
[negative]	[06:11]	<MTecknology>	I'm trying to upgrade to 7.04 through the update manager and I get an error
[neutral]	[06:11]	<MTecknology>	These are my resulting files in /var/log/dist-upgrade/ @HLINK - @HLINK
[negative]	[06:11]	<cesar_>	im sorry, i mean sda1 and sdb1
[neutral]	[06:11]	<wil_syd>	bradyc: so to IDE (PATA)
[negative]	[06:12]	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: what do you mean? I need to change the color of the text on the bottom panel.
[negative]	[06:12]	<bradyc>	Oh?  That's kinda nuts.
[negative]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	no i havent changed or moved anything, all i did was update ubuntu
[negative]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	i had to change my /etc/fstab file
[neutral]	[06:12]	<cesar_>	because it wouldnt mount my home directory
[neutral]	[06:12]	<bradyc>	wil_syd: is that a bug?
[negative]	[06:12]	<dougb>	"i'm having problems with LAMP, i installed all the proper packages and it all went well, but i heard that I can create ""public_html"" in my home directory and type in ""@HLINK as a web address and it would reroute to the proper folder, but it didn't"
[neutral]	[06:12]	<mister_roboto>	xjkx: synaptic
[negative]	[06:13]	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonSchnauz: I do not get your humor about changing font colors.
[negative]	[06:13]	<chowmeined>	how do I edit ogg theora files? I tried opening them with Kino but it fails
[negative]	[06:13]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, just a sarcastic remark,  colored system fonts isn't a feature with Ubuntu
[neutral]	[06:13]	<wil_syd>	bradyc: no.. by design... all moved under the scsi layer like usb drives.
[negative]	[06:13]	<quaal>	ok so if i setup a shared printer with the URI @HLINK:631/printers/officejet_5500_series and i print a test page, it says Printing 1 jobs and then the job goes away and printer status goes back to ready, everything is working fine on the ubuntu end? I'm not getting any printout
[neutral]	[06:13]	<bulmer>	dougb you have the correct apache configuration?
[neutral]	[06:13]	<dougb>	it's all default
[negative]	[06:13]	<chainer827>	it has something to do with the package files that synaptic accesses
[negative]	[06:13]	<dougb>	the tutorial i went by didn't talk about needing to configure apache
[neutral]	[06:13]	<peeps>	Kazol, do you mean for the command line, or the fonts in your desktop environment?
[neutral]	[06:13]	<cesar_>	anyone know why the ubuntu upgrade would just go ahead and change the device names... ?
[negative]	[06:13]	<phixnay>	Shaba1: what happens if you click on the volume adjustor in the menu bar
[negative]	[06:14]	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: so there is no way to change the color of the text at the bottom panel (that shows the open programs)?
[negative]	[06:14]	<mister_roboto>	cesar_: you mean the disk drives?
[negative]	[06:14]	<phixnay>	cesar: cause it's using libsata or something now
[positive]	[06:14]	<bulmer>	dougb you need to learn a little bit about apache
[neutral]	[06:14]	<bradyc>	wil_syd: odd...
[neutral]	[06:14]	<cesar_>	my hard drives
[negative]	[06:14]	<bobesponja>	clicking with my mouse wheel still not working :(
[negative]	[06:14]	<concept10>	xtknight, where did you find info on that kernel boot option?
[negative]	[06:14]	<dougb>	bulmer: thats why i'm here
[positive]	[06:14]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, I would like to thank you for posting a message to me.  atleast I know now that my posts are making it abroad.  :)
[negative]	[06:14]	<xtknight>	concept10, yeah i understand..HT is not enabled by default
[negative]	[06:14]	<cesar_>	i just find it weird that it wouldnt tell me and didnt ask me if i wanted to change
[neutral]	[06:14]	<cesar_>	my etc fstab file
[neutral]	[06:14]	<wil_syd>	!ata > wil_syd
[positive]	[06:14]	<mister_roboto>	cesar_: i don't know why but i find it kind of irritating. the old way was much more readable :)
[neutral]	[06:15]	<bulmer>	dougb this is not apache channel, there is one if you so inclined  #apache
[neutral]	[06:15]	<xtknight>	concept10, @HLINK
[positive]	[06:15]	<cesar_>	well i changed it now so now it works, but i thought i had lost my hard drive lol
[negative]	[06:15]	<wilberfan>	is there a trick to getting .mkv files to run under feisty?!  none of my players will run 'em...
[negative]	[06:15]	<bradyc>	cesar_: I agree if they are going to change it like that on you, they should update common files that point to said names.
[neutral]	[06:15]	<concept10>	xtknight, okay, thanks
[negative]	[06:15]	<peeps>	Kazol, there should be some gnome display preferences somewhere where you can set that(assuming you are running gnome).  I am in XFCE right now, so I can't really look to tell you
[negative]	[06:15]	<alienseer23>	trying to configure lirc, I followed this: @HLINK and every time I try to load ANY module, ($ sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start) it fails. I really don't know...?
[neutral]	[06:15]	<AlexC>	how do you uninstall from a command line?
[negative]	[06:15]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	"Kazol, right, I'm reminded of Henry Ford's comment..........  ""You can have any color, as long as it's black."""
[negative]	[06:15]	<phixnay>	cesar: you're lucky - at least yours still work. My cdrom drive doesn't work at all any more, and no one seems to be able to fix it
[neutral]	[06:15]	<phixnay>	they all ignore me
[negative]	[06:15]	<wilberfan>	i'm almost positive i have all my codecs installed...
[positive]	[06:16]	<se2131>	is fiesty freezing extremely often for anyone else?  I have a Toshiba Satellite w/ an ATI Radeon 9100 fyi
[neutral]	[06:16]	<chainer827>	phixnay: I believe it has something to do with the source and package files that synaptic accesses
[neutral]	[06:16]	<bulmer>	AlexC uninstall? can you elaborate?
[neutral]	[06:16]	<testingltsp>	anybody tested LTSP5?
[neutral]	[06:16]	<madman91>	the plethora of ubuntu users disable it from giving adequate help..
[negative]	[06:16]	<cesar_>	im worried now, i actually havent tried my disk drives
[neutral]	[06:16]	<SeveredCross>	/join #perl
[neutral]	[06:16]	<SeveredCross>	Oops.
[neutral]	[06:16]	<AlexC>	bulmer, i need to uninstall nvidia-glx, i removed a graphics card
[negative]	[06:16]	<alienseer23>	anybody know anything about using a remote control with ubuntu??
[positive]	[06:16]	<madman91>	too high of a problem:problemsolver ratio
[negative]	[06:16]	<phixnay>	chainer827: in that case, try making sure your sources.list is ok
[neutral]	[06:16]	<phixnay>	cesar: good luck
[negative]	[06:17]	<Kazol>	where do I configure programs to automatically open with specific filetypes?
[negative]	[06:17]	<madman91>	alienseer23: what do you mean? remote host.. like controllling another computer?
[negative]	[06:17]	<madman91>	alienseer23: if so.. VNC
[positive]	[06:17]	<acidtabs>	Thank you much Gionny Boss
[negative]	[06:17]	<chainer827>	phixnay: how do i do that?
[negative]	[06:17]	<cesar_>	should i reinstall ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:17]	<bofh80>	AlexC, and what graphics card is it running on now?
[neutral]	[06:17]	<madman91>	alienseer23: no you mean a remote control.. like TV?
[negative]	[06:17]	<alienseer23>	madman91: sorry, no I mean remote control as in TV
[negative]	[06:17]	<testingltsp>	alienseer23: TV remote control in Ubuntu
[negative]	[06:17]	<AlexC>	bofh80, none, i removed it

[positive]	[06:17]	<concept10>	xtknight, i only know because ive never seen it running.. but im about to reboot and see if it works.
[negative]	[06:18]	<testingltsp>	alienseer23: what application u r going to use with?

[negative]	[06:18]	<Kazol>	how can I make it so that vlc automatically opens when I open an .avi file?
[neutral]	[06:18]	<AlexC>	bofh80 ty
[negative]	[06:18]	<bulmer>	AlexC: something like apt-get remove package i believe
[neutral]	[06:18]	<eternaljoy>	madman91: ditto
[neutral]	[06:18]	<alienseer23>	testingltsp: media players like vlc, amaorok
[negative]	[06:18]	<cesar_>	my hard drives are IDE and not SCSI, why are they sda1/ sdb1??
[negative]	[06:19]	<cesar_>	stupid
[neutral]	[06:19]	<xtknight>	cesar_, feisty uses libata
[neutral]	[06:19]	<alienseer23>	testingltsp: perhaps openoffice or some powerpoint if possible
[negative]	[06:19]	<phixnay>	"chainer827: it looks like sources.list is here ""/etc/apt/sources.list"""
[neutral]	[06:19]	<xtknight>	libata makes all IDEs appear that way
[negative]	[06:19]	<cesar_>	whats that mean
[positive]	[06:19]	<wil_syd>	cesar_: you must change... the way of the future... there was a mailing list post about it.... should be fully automagic.
[negative]	[06:19]	<se2131>	is fiesty extremely unstable for anyone else?  Edgy worked fine for me and neither the beta or the final release can stay up for more than 20 minutes w/o crashing
[negative]	[06:19]	<blazemonger>	I am close to smashing this piece of shit computer
[negative]	[06:19]	<chainer827>	phixnay: everything looks fine there.  I believe it is the package lists...it keeps telling me this file has something wrong with it: E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_universe_binary-i386_Packages
[negative]	[06:19]	<xtknight>	cesar_, libata is something in the kernel.  i dont know why they did it that way, but that's the way it is for Feisty
[negative]	[06:19]	<blazemonger>	i have spent all week trying to get a midi sequencer working
[neutral]	[06:19]	<cesar_>	i doubt my cdrom drive will work

[negative]	[06:23]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: dunno... one sec, I'll check.
[negative]	[06:23]	<xtknight>	se2131, hmm well check /var/crash also.  those logs you listed wouldnt indicate a crash..except perhaps apport.log.1 which you may want to check
[positive]	[06:23]	<bulmer>	xtknight: okay, i am looking for tips on how to access the guest os from another remote puter.

[neutral]	[06:23]	<HYPOCRISY>	confidential
[neutral]	[06:23]	<eternaljoy>	paradon: cheers
[negative]	[06:23]	<cesar_>	the reason i had to edit my /etc/fstab is because i mounted /home to its own hard drive
[neutral]	[06:24]	<cesar_>	and when the device names changed my home directory disappeared
[neutral]	[06:24]	<filch>	heh
[negative]	[06:24]	<filch>	that sucks
[negative]	[06:24]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: only through add/remove so far. (im new to linux), i also found the .bin installer on java.com but the last time i tried installing with binary (realplayer) it wouldnt let me run the software, and i couldnt remove it properly, i had to just delete the folder i installed it to.
[positive]	[06:24]	<xtknight>	bulmer, ahh different than shared folders?
[negative]	[06:24]	<Lta1>	"thunderbird help- how do I make thunderbird start up into the inbox, instead of the ""what would you like to do"" esque-screen with EMAIL, ACCOUNTS, and Adv. Features catagories? changing the option under edit-preferences-general didn't seem to change anything."
[negative]	[06:24]	<Bhaskar1>	can i migrate ubuntu 6.06 to edubuntu , Any idea? now i have ubuntu 6.06
[positive]	[06:24]	<xtknight>	bulmer, cuz shared folders is unidirectional AFAIK.  you can only write and read from within the guest OS
[neutral]	[06:24]	<memphis>	has anyone installed/compiled video drivers for Intel 965?
[positive]	[06:24]	<xtknight>	bulmer, you can however enable SMB within the guest OS and have it work like any other networked windows PC (enable SMB in Windows firewall)
[negative]	[06:25]	<bulmer>	xtknight: yeah, i wanted to run a server in the guest os and access it from a client (from a remote computer)
[neutral]	[06:25]	<se2131>	xtknight: the /var/crash directory only has a couple of files that were updated a couple of days ago
[negative]	[06:25]	<peeps>	how can i check what graphics drivers are currently in use on my comptuer?
[neutral]	[06:25]	<se2131>	xtknight: and the apport log just shows some opera pluginwrapper crashes
[positive]	[06:25]	<kahrytan>	eternaljoy:  There is one extention that uses templates.
[negative]	[06:25]	<xtknight>	se2131, ah i suppose youll have to wait if/until it crashes again, unfortunately.  as for next time uhh i'm not sure :\..kinda per-case basis depending on how/what's crashing
[negative]	[06:25]	<oldude67>	ok if i have the latest version of java loaded on to this machine why cant i run frostwire?
[neutral]	[06:25]	<eternaljoy>	kahrytan: which one?
[positive]	[06:26]	<xtknight>	bulmer, you can always run VNC from within the guest OS too
[positive]	[06:26]	<cesar_>	hlep /dev/null throws out everything that is sent to it!1!

[negative]	[06:26]	<xtknight>	se2131, oh :\
[negative]	[06:26]	<GButler>	After I've installed Feisty on my laptop, after the log-in screen, the desktop hangs. It cuts out of the splash screen early and cuts the log-in sound off early as well. Then, it just leaves the desktop and blank menu bars (sometimes no menu bars at all!). I can't right click, and I don't understand what's going on at all. I can boot up in recovery mode (Which I'm doing now), and when I do...
[positive]	[06:26]	<se2131>	xtknight: it worked fine w/ edgy
[negative]	[06:26]	<GButler>	...that it tells me that there's an Internal Error and it cannnot initialize HAL...anyone have an idea of what's going on?
[negative]	[06:26]	<bulmer>	Tarkus: for one, the .bin file you download have to be chmod u+x  then you need to run update-alternatives java
[negative]	[06:26]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: apparently Pan doesn't have built in SSL support, but apparently you can use Stunnel to get the same effect.

[positive]	[06:28]	<AlexC>	and gnome isn't working
[negative]	[06:28]	<concept10>	xtknight, like you said, it must be disabled in the bios or something or needs to be recompiled ... it still didnt come up when I added that kopt (I used grub)
[neutral]	[06:28]	<xtknight>	bulmer, yeah you should be able to do that technically
[positive]	[06:29]	<eternaljoy>	paradon> eternaljoy: No, stunnel is a separate program that runs locally... you make Pan connect to stunnel on localhost, and stunnel connects to the NNTP server using SSL. <-- LOL!  Any ideas how I do this? :P
[negative]	[06:29]	<fizz_>	thomaslai, any idea how to install codecs? just installed it in feisty and it wont play mp3s, when it asks if i want to install codecs it crashes
[positive]	[06:29]	<xtknight>	bulmer, a remote PC should be able to see the guest OS if the windows firewall is disabled
[neutral]	[06:29]	<xtknight>	or configured..
[positive]	[06:29]	<bulmer>	xtknight right, even from the host to the guest
[neutral]	[06:29]	<AlexC>	is the a non gui text editor installed on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[06:29]	<xtknight>	concept10, odd..
[neutral]	[06:29]	<xtknight>	AlexC, vim and nano
[neutral]	[06:30]	<bulmer>	AlexC yes..go to console and use vim
[neutral]	[06:30]	<oldude67>	now can anyone tell me why i cant get frostwire to work?
[negative]	[06:30]	<concept10>	xtknight, alot of laptop manufacturers are stupid and they disable all types of stuff
[neutral]	[06:30]	<xtknight>	nano is better for most stuff, it's less frustrating imo
[negative]	[06:30]	<weltschmerz>	did feisty do something weird with the keymaps?
[negative]	[06:30]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, so I guess I can take it that no one in here knows how to make the tty login work when it has continually rejected the user name and password.
[neutral]	[06:30]	<memphis>	can anyone direct me to compiling intel 965 vga driver?
[neutral]	[06:30]	<xtknight>	well less frustrating for n00bs

[negative]	[06:30]	<compgood>	just out of curiosity, is any script put into /etc/init.d executed automatically on boot?

[neutral]	[06:32]	<concept10>	xtknight, I know HP was disabling the new Intel virtulization features on the laptop motherboard somehow because alot of people complained about not being able to use those features
[neutral]	[06:32]	<toastjam>	hey, so is there anyway to get the kernel make install process to create the necessary initrd image as well?
[negative]	[06:32]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, I get the login but it doesn't recognise my password
[positive]	[06:32]	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: it is installed, you just have to make rules. look into fwbuilder
[negative]	[06:32]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: According to google, yes.  Really, stunnel should work with pretty much anything.

[negative]	[06:32]	<wil_syd>	rpaul: is that a ghost of you ? Wait till it times out.
[positive]	[06:32]	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: it gives you a nice gui for creating a firewall script
[negative]	[06:32]	<konam>	ubotu i already do it: could you tell me howto get window border after the windows effects get enabled....?
[negative]	[06:32]	<eternaljoy>	paradon: so I install Pan and Stunnel.  Then what I do?
[neutral]	[06:32]	<jrib>	"MrBarkyVonShnauz: reboot and choose ""recovery mode"" from the grub menu.  then do 'passwd USERNAME' to set a new password.  See if that resolves things"
[positive]	[06:32]	<toastjam>	everything I read online says making and installing the kernel creates initrd, but as far as I can tell it doesn't, and my system won't boot without it
[neutral]	[06:32]	<bofh80>	eternaljoy, @HLINK   how's about that?
[neutral]	[06:32]	<Shaddox>	lordhelmet: Does it support being used on this machine over SSH?
[neutral]	[06:32]	<xtknight>	bulmer, weird.  so other PCs on the host's LAN /can't/ access the guest..
[negative]	[06:33]	<rpaul>	wil_syd: i registered a few months ago.  so it isn't a ghost, I just don't seem to be able to identify myself correctly
[neutral]	[06:33]	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: take a look at securetty  /etc/securetty
[neutral]	[06:33]	<xtknight>	"se2131, pastebin ""sudo lshw"" also"
[negative]	[06:33]	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: probably with xforwarding, but they have windows clients as well so you can create your script anywhere and just scp it over or something
[positive]	[06:33]	<concept10>	"xtknight, I just found this: To achieve the maximum gain from Hyper-Threading requires the 2.6 kernel compiled with the ""-march=pentium4"" option. This is accomplished by setting the processor to ""pentium4"" in the kernel configuration menu. It looks like Hyper-Threading on the Pentium4 with Linux is fact after all."
[positive]	[06:33]	<bulmer>	xtknight: yes because the guest is usually on a different subnet
[neutral]	[06:33]	<paradon>	eternaljoy: configure stunnel to connect to your NNTPS server, and configure Pan with stunnel as it's NNTP server.
[positive]	[06:33]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, cool, thanks............. bulmer I will, thanks
[positive]	[06:33]	<concept10>	xtknight, but I have HT tired head now :)

[negative]	[06:41]	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: thats close enuff for testing, you can attempt to change a users password by opening an xconsole

[neutral]	[06:41]	<weltschmerz>	what files does feisty use to define keymaps?

[neutral]	[06:42]	<zeroday>	rythmbox
[neutral]	[06:42]	<GButler>	I get an Internal Error that says it cannot initialize HAL when I boot up the laptop in recovery mode, would that cause a hang up in the normal boot?

[neutral]	[06:42]	<obble>	stroppytux I IMed you with my question: I'm having trouble adding source files to my projects
[neutral]	[06:42]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	bulmer, cool, I remember having to do that once about 5 months ago now.
[positive]	[06:43]	<Col_Delta>	can always add KDE Skipzorz
[negative]	[06:43]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy what files define the keymaps?  my xkb keymap for Esperanto is no longer working.
[negative]	[06:43]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: when i installed realplayer, since it didnt work, is it a bad thing to install it again? or should i remove every trace of it first and then install? or does it matter at all?
[negative]	[06:43]	<blazemonger>	if i can't find a piece of midi sequencing software that i can use with   my midi gear then i'm smashing this laptop AND the pc
[positive]	[06:43]	<Skipzorz>	thanks col
[negative]	[06:43]	<Madpilot>	Skipzorz, no, it isn't. Servers don't need a UI - it's just one more thing to get attacked if it's on the web
[negative]	[06:43]	<Skipzorz>	ah
[neutral]	[06:43]	<Skipzorz>	well that makes sense now that I think about it
[negative]	[06:43]	<se2131>	xtknight: sorry, crashed again
[negative]	[06:43]	<xtknight>	se2132, i dont meant to scare you, but.  @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:43]	<bulmer>	Tarkus: i do not know about real player ..you may not need to remove all the traces..btw there are no hidden Registries in linux like in windows to hide stuff
[positive]	[06:43]	<Skipzorz>	thanks madpilot
[negative]	[06:44]	<MrTexor>	:(
[negative]	[06:44]	<obble>	stroppytux: i've tried right clicking over the src files to see if theres an add source file or something like that. but there isnt
[neutral]	[06:44]	<n2diy>	"weltschmerz: check out "" man loadkeys"" and ""system -prefrences-keyboard"""
[neutral]	[06:44]	<xtknight>	se2131, suppoesdly that laptop is notorious for freezing
[negative]	[06:44]	<xjkx>	Please check what mp3 player came by default :(
[negative]	[06:44]	<thebillywayne>	my motherboard came with a disc with Linux shell scripts on it.  Should I run these?
[negative]	[06:44]	<MrTexor>	ok, I'm stupid.. but I cant find the llink for the torrent file :(
[negative]	[06:44]	<xtknight>	se2131, again though if it doesn't happen on Edgy or windows/etc... then you can ignore that as that can't be the problem
[negative]	[06:44]	<Madpilot>	Skipzorz, that said, you can run Apache/etc on a standard install too - useful if you want a testing/dev server that isn't exposed to the public
[negative]	[06:44]	<bulmer>	thebillywayne: why not see whats in it before running the script?
[negative]	[06:45]	<obble>	Alright anyone else know how to fix my Kdevelop problem: I'm just trying to add already made source files to a project. But I cant manage to do it.
[negative]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: oh man, so maybe i should talk to toshiba
[negative]	[06:45]	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: I would never run a script without looking it over first.
[negative]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: I should also clarify the type of crash i'm having
[negative]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, why dont you just try Edgy for the night , like right now, and see if it hapepns
[negative]	[06:45]	<Zues_62>	does anyone know of a lit file reader for ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, hmm yeah what do you mean by crash then?
[neutral]	[06:45]	<fernando>	hello
[neutral]	[06:45]	<Skipzorz>	well, I already have an apache server set up on windows, and am converting it to ubuntu server
[negative]	[06:45]	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, bulmer, looking at it, though I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
[negative]	[06:45]	<Shaezsche>	"what does the ""dbe"" module in xorg do? what is double buffering"
[negative]	[06:45]	<root__>	how do you scroll up bash?
[positive]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: the mouse is still responsive
[negative]	[06:45]	<Shaezsche>	if i want more fps should i load it or not
[negative]	[06:45]	<Skipzorz>	windows is attacked to much
[negative]	[06:45]	<xtknight>	se2131, oh..
[positive]	[06:45]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: so, in linux when it installs, it only puts stuff in the directory i specified? or does it still scatter stuff arround in the system that will take many hours to find them?
[negative]	[06:45]	<se2131>	xtknight: but I can't do anything with the applciations
[negative]	[06:45]	<Madpilot>	MrTexor, look for the .torrent files at the same places you download the rest of the Ubuntu ISOs
[negative]	[06:45]	<obble>	Can someone pretty please help me with a Kdevelop issue?
[positive]	[06:46]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, why is it the linux community say server and they mean 'web' server, why is that? not File server or Backup Server or Application server, like business wise, why is that? lol it drives me potty :P
[positive]	[06:46]	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: Yeah, that can be a drawback. I wold recommend learning bash scripting at some point.
[negative]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, it could be I/O overload, perhaps from updatedb trying to update the search database.
[negative]	[06:46]	<se2131>	xtknight: i can't do ctrl-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-del, or ctrl-alt-f1
[negative]	[06:46]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i know where the keyboard preferences are.  i'm talking about the XKB file where you define the keymaps.
[negative]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, try alt SysRq K next time
[negative]	[06:46]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, what does that do?
[negative]	[06:46]	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, yeah.  that's it.
[neutral]	[06:46]	<xtknight>	se2131, kills all open apps, it's a last resort/kernel debug
[negative]	[06:46]	<lordhelmet>	gah why does this install fail all the time?? stupid translation files...
[negative]	[06:46]	<NemesisD>	can you guys help me fix ubuntu? attempting to upgrade seems to have just about destroyed my ubuntu partition
[negative]	[06:46]	<peeps>	"anyone know what ""dos2unix"" is?  i think i need this program"
[negative]	[06:46]	<root__>	how do you scroll bash?
[positive]	[06:46]	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	thanks bulmer,
[neutral]	[06:46]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy for instance:     key <AE06> { [          6,  asciicircum, dead_circumflex, dead_circumflex ]  };
[neutral]	[06:46]	<Madpilot>	bofh80, not sure - because most of the time when people say 'server' they mean 'web server', probably. People who want advice on a file server will generally be more specific than just 'server'
[negative]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
[negative]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, if your mouse moves, alt sysrq K will unfreeze your PC.  not that you shold be using that regularly.  in fact you should never use it ideally but it's not like it's harmful
[neutral]	[06:47]	<bulmer>	Tarkus it puts stuff in what is considered normal directories like /etc for the configs  or /usr/local/ ..read the package you are installing and find out as much..but for java its not that awkward
[positive]	[06:47]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, ahh i see, that makes sense, LOL.
[neutral]	[06:47]	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: roger, then check out the man page for loadkeys
[negative]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: i guess anything in a pinch
[negative]	[06:47]	<Moosejaw>	is it possible that feisty is effecting my wireless NICS range with my router?
[positive]	[06:47]	<Skipzorz>	is LAMP the best way to go for servers?
[negative]	[06:47]	<zak_>	peeps: changes DOS text format into a unix text format [fixes newline glitches...]  it can be done with standard commands though, someone should be able to fill you in
[positive]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, but if the mouse is moving that means your kernel is still running
[positive]	[06:47]	<bofh80>	Madpilot, thanks for clearing that up, another n00b problem.  heheheheheh
[negative]	[06:47]	<xtknight>	se2131, meaning you could alt sysrq K , goto a virtual terminal, and check dmesg or save it to a file and post it
[negative]	[06:47]	<bulmer>	Skipzorz: what do you want to serve?
[neutral]	[06:47]	<se2131>	xtknight: is there a way to limit the rate of  I/O
[neutral]	[06:48]	<xtknight>	se2131, almost /certainly/ dmesg will have useful info in it
[negative]	[06:48]	<oldude67>	trying to get frostwire to run but keeps coming up with no java installed and have the newest when i type in the command to apt-get
[positive]	[06:48]	<Skipzorz>	simple website
[negative]	[06:48]	<GButler>	Does any one here know why, on a laptop, I'd get an Internal Error that says Ubuntu cannot initialize the HAL when I boot up in recovery mode, and when I try to boot into the normal mode it just hangs, cuts the splash screen off and just loads a wallpaper?
[positive]	[06:48]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: java is installing now though add/remove. it started working. is that a good way to do it?
[negative]	[06:48]	<xtknight>	se2131, not that i know of.
[negative]	[06:48]	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
[negative]	[06:48]	<peeps>	zak_, do you know what package i need to install?  I need to compile something from source and the makefile is failing because of this
[neutral]	[06:48]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:48]	<weltschmerz>	i wrote that.

[neutral]	[06:48]	<tom_>	can someone help me
[positive]	[06:48]	<xtknight>	se2131, all we have to do now is wait ;P im sure it wont be long
[negative]	[06:48]	<bulmer>	Skipzorz: yes thats okay, but am partial to Tomcat which is a webserver and java based
[neutral]	[06:48]	<|ringo|>	peeps: apt-get install build-essential

[negative]	[06:48]	<bulmer>	Tarkus umm how do you know its working? the one you installed?
[negative]	[06:49]	<kahrytan>	Is this channel alternative to ubuntuforums.org?

[neutral]	[06:52]	<bofh80>	sam__, you can use ftp to access all the files on your system . . .

[neutral]	[06:52]	<Death_Sargent>	gnome and kde won't work
[neutral]	[06:52]	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i fixed it using my own advice, using a much older xkb file.

[neutral]	[06:54]	<Tarkus>	bulmer: nice
[negative]	[06:54]	<paradon>	sam__: and you'll want to edit /etc/vsftpd.conf, by default it only has anonymous access enabled.
[neutral]	[06:54]	<bulmer>	"Moosejaw: im still not sure i comprehend ""less range"" as in your nic is not able to listen to an AP ?"
[negative]	[06:55]	<scotty_>	Alright, I have a question regarding feisty install.
[positive]	[06:55]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: the signal strength isnt as strong as it was
[negative]	[06:55]	<sanityx>	I had to reinstall windows after I installed ubuntu. To resture grub I can just boot off the feisty cd right
[negative]	[06:55]	<xtknight>	Moosejaw,  it's possible the driver is more picky about the wireless range somehow.  usually that's a wireless/RF chipset tolerance not a driver one though who knows.
[neutral]	[06:55]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: ttySX is a serial port
[neutral]	[06:55]	<sanityx>	whats the command again, grub-install?
[positive]	[06:56]	<Moosejaw>	xtknight thanks
[negative]	[06:56]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: where do I put that?
[negative]	[06:56]	<xtknight>	why does nothing tab complete when i prefix it with sudo?

[neutral]	[06:56]	<scotty_>	Is that normal?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<diabolix>	anyone here use deskbar?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<xtknight>	no commands tabcomplete but filenames do when using 'sudo'
[negative]	[06:56]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: maybe the drivers used are not using the same capabilities..besides anything wireless is not guaranteed to work 100%
[negative]	[06:56]	<|ringo|>	sanityx: next time you install windows after linux, do this before installing windows: dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 > /tmp/backup/MBR.bin
[negative]	[06:56]	<Shaba1>	I have no dies what it is diabolix
[neutral]	[06:56]	<|ringo|>	that backs up the master book record, so you can restore it after windows deletes it
[negative]	[06:56]	<sanityx>	heh ok
[negative]	[06:56]	<oldude67>	why is it i cant get frostwire to see the new java installed?
[negative]	[06:57]	<sanityx>	|ringo|: yeah but then the mbr wont have a windows listing
[neutral]	[06:57]	<Shaba1>	But am interested in findign out
[positive]	[06:57]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: it was working great in edgy with the same drivers...so i sorta expected the same in feisty
[negative]	[06:57]	<diabolix>	xtknight, thats because bash searches you're path for the command to run, but only searches the working directory for arguments.
[neutral]	[06:57]	<|ringo|>	sanityx: right but then you run uh...  grub-install and it will find windows and add it to the grub list
[positive]	[06:57]	<bofh80>	xtknight, works for me
[positive]	[06:57]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Just set both boxes up to us the same ttySX, baud rates, etc... It is a simple serial port connection.
[negative]	[06:57]	<sanityx>	|ringo|: ah ok
[positive]	[06:57]	<diabolix>	i seem to remember that working in edgy tho...
[negative]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	diabolix, ah hmm.  bash does have some features i'd deem far more advanced such as argument tab completing so i wondered
[neutral]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	bofh80, interesting
[negative]	[06:58]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: but just because I can talk to the port doesn't mean it will give me a login prompt
[positive]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	bofh80, you can type sudo grub-i and it will say grub-install?
[negative]	[06:58]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: again, umm nothing is guaranteed..and how do you really measure this percieved slowness?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ah, I see. Look into ssh
[positive]	[06:58]	<bofh80>	xtknight, yup, works...
[neutral]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	well for reasons i cant possibly conceive my bash /gnome terminal has been messed from the start on this instlal of Feisty
[neutral]	[06:58]	<KevinOoO>	anyone know how to add transparency to a panel background???
[neutral]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	so who knows
[negative]	[06:58]	<diabolix>	so.. does anyone know how to make the deskbar only search google? it asks for amazon and all this stuff i don't care about.
[neutral]	[06:58]	<xtknight>	diabolix, it's in the preferences isnt it..
[positive]	[06:58]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: you have no clue, do you ? :)
[neutral]	[06:59]	<scotty_>	"I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the ""install"" button at the end of the process.

[negative]	[06:59]	<diabolix>	xtknight, it is, but it doesn't do anything.
[neutral]	[06:59]	<Skiguy>	anyone running azureus on 7.04?
[negative]	[06:59]	<bofh80>	xtknight, log on a TTY as root and see if it autocompletes commands as root ?
[negative]	[06:59]	<SpeakerMania>	Quick question: If I have a high speed connection, can I plug the network cable inot my computer and have instant internet access? Or do I have to configure stuff? I have 6.10.
[negative]	[06:59]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Umm, I guess not, I have two boxes networked, talking to each other etc...
[neutral]	[06:59]	<xtknight>	i prefer gnome-bt-download (simplistic bittorrent)
[negative]	[06:59]	<peeps>	how can i verify which graphics driver is running?
[positive]	[06:59]	<xtknight>	though a bit limited/terse
[neutral]	[07:00]	<KevinOoO>	anyone know how to add transparency to a panel background???
[negative]	[07:00]	<Skiguy>	Speaker: should be immediate, assuming your card is recognized. almost all are.
[negative]	[07:00]	<SpeakerMania>	Alright, thanks.
[negative]	[07:00]	<n2diy>	Car'FK: Umm, I guess not, I have two boxes networked, talking to each other etc...
[positive]	[07:00]	<xtknight>	"bofh80, yea it works under ""sudo i"" # shell"
[negative]	[07:00]	<bofh80>	xtknight, i ended up using that, cos all the other bittorrent clients for linux are , well, cough . . . .
[neutral]	[07:00]	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: Right click it
[negative]	[07:00]	<Andruk>	xtknight: i am simply trying to get gnome to start metacity (or any window manager) when i log in.
[neutral]	[07:00]	<ozymandias>	anyone have a guide on getting compiz-kde working?
[negative]	[07:00]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: I got networking too.  trying to make one a bridge, and getting tired of loosing my ssh connection.  figured a serial connection would survive all my network restarts that dont start
[negative]	[07:00]	<bulmer>	xtknight: try tput reset  and see if it resets to some default working terminal
[neutral]	[07:00]	<scotty_>	anyone?
[neutral]	[07:00]	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: Under background, you can set the opacity
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xtknight>	Andruk, but what has happened up until this point?  metacity should be starting
[neutral]	[07:01]	<xtknight>	Andruk, gnome should 'just work' (tm)
[neutral]	[07:01]	<Andruk>	i upgraded to feisty...
[neutral]	[07:01]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, i know how to do that, but im using a theme, which has a bckground
[negative]	[07:01]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, if you use a backround you cant set opacity, theres another way
[neutral]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	bulmer, it cleared my screen basically
[positive]	[07:02]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, then your right, I don't have a clue! :) Are the other boxes playing with winders?
[negative]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	bulmer, hrm what does that do?
[neutral]	[07:02]	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: I have mine set to white with the opacity at around 30%
[positive]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	"bulmer, different than ""clear""?"
[negative]	[07:02]	<Andruk>	xtknight: well, i can start metacity from the terminal, and when i hit ctrl+c it exits, then automatically restarts metacity.  but if i just log in and leave gnome alone, metacity does not load
[neutral]	[07:02]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: well, I have samba and some win boxes too
[positive]	[07:02]	<bofh80>	hmm, i don't get it, how come no one is raving about their cool 3d desktops ? ;p
[negative]	[07:02]	<bulmer>	xtknight: tput is basically for terminal setting
[negative]	[07:02]	<xtknight>	Andruk, weird.  hmm look in ~/.xinitrc maybe
[negative]	[07:03]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, I only am playing with Ubuntu to Ubuntu.
[neutral]	[07:03]	<bulmer>	xtknight: it has options i cant remember though
[neutral]	[07:03]	<Ademan>	how might one import emails from a previous installation of ubuntu into a new one? (evolution)
[neutral]	[07:03]	<xtknight>	Ademan, maybe access the ~/.evolution folder of the old ubuntu
[negative]	[07:03]	<xtknight>	Ademan, i thought feisty's installer also had profile importing you could do
[positive]	[07:03]	<Ademan>	xtknight: it very well may
[negative]	[07:03]	<eoX>	Hi is it true that if i install linux first then windows will not install b/c it will not recongnize the linux partitions?
[negative]	[07:03]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: thats all I am trying to do right now.   login from ubuntu1 to u2 via the serial cable and null modem
[neutral]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	Ademan, only in the livecd installer though not Alternate or Update-manager->feisty
[negative]	[07:04]	<bofh80>	Ademan, if you know where the data is, surely evolution has it's own import process?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	Ademan, not 100% sure so backup ~/.evolution or export from within the app?
[negative]	[07:04]	<Gumby>	eoX: you cant install windows on a linux partition.
[negative]	[07:04]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, so what is wrong with ssh then?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<scott1>	"I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the ""install"" button at the end of the process. Now there's just an item in my taskbar called ""Installing system."" When clicked, it brings a window to focus. However, the window is tiny and just has a little gray box in it. Is that normal?"
[neutral]	[07:04]	<Ademan>	eoX: no windows will install, but it will overwrite GRUB and you'll hafta do extra work to get to your linux partition, linux will autodetect your windows partition and everything will be easier
[neutral]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	actually sometimes windows wont even install
[negative]	[07:04]	<xtknight>	because it's so picky
[neutral]	[07:04]	<bulmer>	CarlFK: is the a getty process running on those serial ports?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, look at this preview @HLINK
[negative]	[07:05]	<Ademan>	xtknight: well i'm backing up my entire home directory so you know, whatever, hopefully it will work
[negative]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	itll say unrecognized boot partition because GRUB is there
[neutral]	[07:05]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: ssh goes over ip -
[neutral]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	and wont install
[negative]	[07:05]	<xtknight>	ive had that :(
[negative]	[07:05]	<bofh80>	Ademan, i looked at the evolution import option, bit lacking isn't it lol
[negative]	[07:05]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: i think i have things working better now...thanks for your help.
[negative]	[07:05]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: du no.  the one I am trying to connect 'to' is running a fresh feisty
[negative]	[07:05]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: no problem, sometimes pointing out that there are no guarantees, people realize some stuff are acceptable afterall
[negative]	[07:06]	<Ademan>	bofh80: haha, yeah, i guess i'll just keep .evolution around in case i ever need to find an old email, and other than that, i'll just start fresh
[negative]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: on a separate note, my upload speed is now equivalent to my download speed...which makes no sense.  how can i improve my download speed?
[negative]	[07:06]	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: OK! Now who doesn't have a clue?! IP is serial comms!
[negative]	[07:06]	<eoX>	ademan for me i did windows install and its ok but when i installed linux first then windows will hang at examining hardwares and give a black screen before even going into the blue agreement screen
[neutral]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	my upspeed is 1301/kbs and my dload is 1000/lbs
[neutral]	[07:06]	<Moosejaw>	kbs
[positive]	[07:06]	<bofh80>	Ademan, i had high hopes for evolution, it has a few nice tricks up it sleeve, but it's pants :)
[positive]	[07:06]	<Ademan>	eoX: interesting, i personally have done both, and both worked, just windows second took a lot more work
[negative]	[07:06]	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
[positive]	[07:07]	<axisys>	does ubuntu works with cisco leap?
[neutral]	[07:07]	<Ademan>	lol bofh80
[positive]	[07:07]	<tankcat>	i just order a machine with an amd64 dualcore cpu for $310 :-)
[positive]	[07:07]	<Andruk>	xtknight: i dont have an ~/.xinitrc (and yes, i am looking at hidden files).  i do have an ~/.xsession-errors though, would you like to see that?
[negative]	[07:07]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: yean, but first I would have to bring up a ip over serial connection, which would get screwed the same way my eth0 connection is getting screwed
[negative]	[07:07]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: the site your downloading from have to be capable of doing same too or higher speed than yours..lots of factors..isp maybe have you throttled
[positive]	[07:07]	<renato>	everyone happy with Feisty?
[neutral]	[07:07]	<xtknight>	Andruk, sure that may be helpful
[positive]	[07:07]	<liz>	yes yes :)
[negative]	[07:07]	<eoX>	ademan did you use mkfs.vfat and fdisk to make a parition first in linux? or use gpart to parition the empty space first before you install windows to it?
[neutral]	[07:07]	<xtknight>	Ademan, @HLINK
[positive]	[07:07]	<Moosejaw>	hrm...my dload speed should be 6000kbs...just unusual
[positive]	[07:07]	<Phineas>	renato, it's fantastic. Brought me back from the darkside
[negative]	[07:07]	<liquiddoom>	Feisty rocks. I have a couple errors every now and then, but oh well.

[negative]	[07:08]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: are you paying bit for bit like a leased line or you are using dsl or version of adsl like ?
[negative]	[07:08]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok so you are having other problems too?
[neutral]	[07:08]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: getty's used to be setup in /etc/initab, but that went away a few versions ago
[negative]	[07:08]	<tom_>	xtknight, do you know how to help me... I have gone through all that before and had to reinstall feisty 4 times
[negative]	[07:08]	<_3uG_>	quick question.. what's the difference between linux-image-###-386 and linux-image-###-generic?
[negative]	[07:08]	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
[negative]	[07:08]	<liz>	tom: whats not working right?
[positive]	[07:09]	<Ademan>	eoX: i used the partitioner included with the ubuntu installer, which at the time was gparted
[positive]	[07:09]	<bulmer>	CarlFK: on a dapper am using now, its still is enabled
[negative]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, what video adapter do you have?

[positive]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, i wont say i WILL be able to fix your resolution problem but i very likely will be able to
[negative]	[07:09]	<tom_>	xtknight, you mean my video card?
[positive]	[07:09]	<CarlFK>	bulmer: huh - maybe Ill just give it a shot :)
[negative]	[07:09]	<xtknight>	tom_, yes or onboard video chip, whichever applies
[negative]	[07:09]	<eoX>	ademan yeah i did the same but windows installer hangs with linux present its not a big deal i just wanted to know so thanks
[negative]	[07:09]	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: you can not really complain of not getting same speed upload or download unless your ISP guarantees it..which most likely they wont
[negative]	[07:09]	<liz>	tom: define looks right, what does it look like

[negative]	[07:11]	<xtknight>	tom_, okay have you tried installing the nvidia drives?
[positive]	[07:11]	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thanks
[negative]	[07:11]	<liz>	tom: kk yor using an nvidia 6600 have you downloaded the drivers yets from nvidia (the stock open source nv driver constantly freezes on me)_
[neutral]	[07:11]	<tom_>	xtknight, I installed the restricted drivers from the option
[negative]	[07:11]	<xtknight>	yeah stock nv is awful
[neutral]	[07:11]	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, i dont see that under preferences anymore in feisty..

[neutral]	[07:11]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK

[negative]	[07:12]	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: Nor do I. Odd.
[neutral]	[07:12]	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thats what i have used, and need to change my MTU according to the tweak tester

[negative]	[07:12]	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, did that run something i could run in a term?
[negative]	[07:13]	<_3uG_>	i'm trying to get my nvidia drivers to work too, but the restricted drivers manager installs the old 7xxx kernel driver and the newer 9xxx glx file.. which doesn't make sense.
[negative]	[07:13]	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: I don't know, I'll check
[neutral]	[07:13]	<tom_>	xtknight, nvidia was shown
[negative]	[07:13]	<blanky>	guys how do we install ati drivers, in the ati wiki page it just shows instructions for edgy and dapper, do we use edgy instructions?
[positive]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	"tom_, type ""sudo nvidia-settings"".  look at the settings in there.  you should be able to change your resolution."
[negative]	[07:13]	<Phineas>	blanky: what ati card are you using?
[positive]	[07:13]	<bofh80>	xtknight, should he be using nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new ? i think the latter? will the restricted manager have installed the correct one?
[negative]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800, no, I don't want the open source drivers
[negative]	[07:13]	<RushCreek>	Hey, my roomate changed my root password, i cant get into init 1 to change it, is there anyway to resolve this?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	bofh80, restricted seems to always install -glx i think.  im not sure honesly
[neutral]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800 pro
[neutral]	[07:13]	<xtknight>	bofh80, good point though
[neutral]	[07:13]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: Shouldn't that be gksudo nvidia-settings?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<blanky>	Phineas, ??
[positive]	[07:14]	<RushCreek>	use the readon driver blanky it works with AIGLX
[negative]	[07:14]	<tom_>	xtknight, you are a god
[neutral]	[07:14]	<tom_>	w00t
[neutral]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, perhaps im not sure
[negative]	[07:14]	<blanky>	RushCreek, yeah thanks but how do you install it
[neutral]	[07:14]	<bofh80>	lol
[negative]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	"tom_, if the resolution succeeds you press the button that says ""save to X configuration"""
[neutral]	[07:14]	<ardchoille>	!gksudo
[positive]	[07:14]	<ubotu>	If you need to run graphical applications as root, use  gksudo , as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using  sudo <GUI-application> 
[negative]	[07:14]	<tom_>	xtknight, 9 damn hours of work and you fixed it in 2 seconds
[negative]	[07:14]	<blanky>	wait though the radeon driver is the open source one isn't it
[neutral]	[07:14]	<RushCreek>	blanky:  what version of ubuntu? it comes with edgy for a fact, and probobly the rls before
[negative]	[07:14]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yes but what about apps that may be wrappers for gtk apps?

[neutral]	[07:14]	<axisys>	is there a wifi chnl for ubuntu?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<blanky>	RushCreek, no I want the proprietary drivers not the open source ones...nevermind
[neutral]	[07:15]	<RushCreek>	fglrx ?
[negative]	[07:15]	<tom_>	xtknight, will I have any problems if I install beryl?
[negative]	[07:15]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: I'm not sure there.
[neutral]	[07:15]	<RushCreek>	you can install thoes via apt banky
[negative]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yeah gksu would be used for nvidia-settings
[neutral]	[07:15]	<RushCreek>	apt-get install fglrx-module or some such biz
[negative]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	ardchoille, what does 'gksu' even do differently anyways?
[negative]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	i genreally use it reliously instead of sudo
[negative]	[07:15]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: That isn't a static IP, and IP should look like 123.345.567.999
[neutral]	[07:15]	<crdlb>	blanky, did you try the restricted manager?
[neutral]	[07:15]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use gksudo for GTK apps
[neutral]	[07:15]	<xtknight>	tom_, i dont think so
[negative]	[07:15]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use sudo sometimes doesn't work right with them
[negative]	[07:16]	<RushCreek>	so anyone have any ideas on resetting a root password on a local machine?
[neutral]	[07:16]	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Err.
[negative]	[07:16]	<Phineas>	Hey guys, how do I set a keystroke to launch the terminal?
[neutral]	[07:16]	<blanky>	crdlb, thanks, I'm new to feisty, where is that? system > administration?
[negative]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	liquiddoom, yeah i know.  i'd like as many details as possible as to the differences between gksu and sudo
[positive]	[07:16]	<ardchoille>	xtknight: It sets up the environment better than sudo does.
[neutral]	[07:16]	<crdlb>	blanky, yes
[negative]	[07:16]	<blanky>	crdlb, yeah it's there, thanks!
[negative]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	ah

[positive]	[07:16]	<Doughy>	anyone have time to help me with a gnome login prob?
[negative]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	tom_, did you save the config to X11/xorg.conf?
[negative]	[07:16]	<xtknight>	tom_, there is a button in nvidia-settings you must press after appyling the resolution
[neutral]	[07:16]	<blanky>	man feisty is a huge milestone in desktop linux
[negative]	[07:16]	<tom_>	xtknight, .... one problem in the terminal when I clicked save to X configuration file it gave me an Error: FAiled to generate an X config file!
[negative]	[07:17]	<Phineas>	Doughy, what's the problem?
[negative]	[07:17]	<xtknight>	"tom_, did you run nvidia-settings with ""sudo"" (well it should be ""gksudo"")"

[negative]	[07:17]	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to install realplayer? iv tried installing the .bin and it never works, im pretty sure i am installing it correctly also.
[negative]	[07:17]	<xtknight>	Feisty should read the EDID
[negative]	[07:17]	<Doughy>	I think it has something to do with beryl or the compiz features in ubuntu 7.04, but not sure
[negative]	[07:18]	<xtknight>	but i heard we will have to wait until Xorg 7.3 for that :\
[negative]	[07:18]	<tom_>	xtknight, yes I tried both sudo and gksudo neither allowed me to save the xfile
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Phineas>	Doughy, did you install beryl?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Doughy>	I installed, then uninstalled beryl
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Doughy>	yes
[negative]	[07:18]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: um... yes.  why are you telling me this?
[negative]	[07:18]	<xtknight>	"tom_, well let's just add it manually.  type ""gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"""
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Phineas>	did you rerun the xorg config?
[negative]	[07:18]	<bofh80>	xtknight, cos of the rush redevelopment when nvidia rehashed the drivers just prior to release day lol

[neutral]	[07:20]	<Phineas>	Doughy, go through and check the settings
[negative]	[07:20]	<xtknight>	tom_, add the resolution to the bottom (1680x1050)

[negative]	[07:21]	<Kellster>	Can someone PLEASE help me with wireless on a DV9000 HP laptop.
[negative]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, it really should, if you restart your X server.
[neutral]	[07:21]	<Phineas>	Nemesis: did you check that your password is correct?
[negative]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, let's just try now and we will debug as we go
[negative]	[07:21]	<tom_>	xtknight, can I add 1400x900 instead?
[positive]	[07:21]	<Phineas>	Doughy: check this link, @HLINK it is a good tutorial about resolution and screen settings
[neutral]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	tom_, yes you can add that but i'd recommend 'also' not 'instead'
[neutral]	[07:21]	<xtknight>	1680x1050 is your native

[negative]	[07:28]	<xjkx>	why i cant see a fluxbuntu-desktop on apt-get ?
[negative]	[07:28]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Why do you only have one IP address listed for Linuxbox1, when you are showing a eth0 and wlan0 connections?
[neutral]	[07:28]	<xtknight>	xjkx, because it's not an official derivative

[neutral]	[07:28]	<Diablo69er>	morning all

[neutral]	[07:29]	<ardchoille>	"ctrl+alt+f1 never returns a prompt. It says ""Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)"" is this normal?"

[negative]	[07:29]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, so eth0 and wlan0 share the same IP? interesting.
[negative]	[07:29]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, it doesn't show in gparted?
[neutral]	[07:29]	<] Johnny[>	I have everything in their set to usb audio

[negative]	[07:31]	<sam__>	but how do i use the ftp to acess the filefolders and add new file folders???
[neutral]	[07:31]	<liquiddoom>	sam__: You have to install an FTP server
[negative]	[07:31]	<liquiddoom>	sam__: I use proftpd

[negative]	[07:32]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about qeme - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:32]	<ubotu>	qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see @HLINK
[negative]	[07:32]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: ok, I'll turn off my other external drives so I don't mess anything up
[neutral]	[07:32]	<liquiddoom>	sam__: I installed and configured proftpd from webmin. I think webmin can configure proftpd and wu-ftpd
[negative]	[07:32]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: no.  if I give wlan an IP, I can ping what is connected to it.  when I make it part of the bridge, it 'breaks'
[negative]	[07:32]	<sam__>	because i want it to be like webmin, just have a way to acess teh root folders and such from this computer
[negative]	[07:32]	<xtknight>	"compwiz18, ""sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 count=512 bs=1 | strings""  (make /sure/ not to replace if= with of= (the keys are next to each other))"

[negative]	[07:32]	<tom_>	xtknight, alright well it added the 1600 one
[negative]	[07:32]	<Diablo69er>	yeah I looked into a qemu--and it looked like a pain in the ass to install
[negative]	[07:32]	<sam__>	want to run appahce

[neutral]	[07:33]	<liquiddoom>	sam__: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:33]	<xtknight>	tom_, that's a byproduct of changing resolutions sometimes.  i dont know why 1440x900 isnt listed though :\\
[negative]	[07:33]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: what is this command going to give me?
[negative]	[07:33]	<tom_>	xtknight, like the time/clock/powerbuttong/wirelss got all rearranged
[negative]	[07:33]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Sounds like a problem in the bridge config?
[negative]	[07:33]	<Diablo69er>	....well I guess not
[negative]	[07:33]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, an idea of the first 512 bytes of your partition.  it can show problems sometimes
[negative]	[07:34]	<Skiguy>	anyone have any ideas on why azureus wouldn't run after I upgraded to 7.04? running from the terminal I get a confuzing error. @HLINK
[negative]	[07:34]	<tom_>	xtknight, i am slow... it was there... i missed it
[negative]	[07:34]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, you probably won't see any text at all.  but if you do it could indicate a problem..  i suggest pastebinning the output
[neutral]	[07:34]	<xtknight>	!pastebin
[neutral]	[07:34]	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[negative]	[07:34]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: could be.  any clue how I should set it up?
[neutral]	[07:34]	<Diablo69er>	take care
[negative]	[07:34]	<Kellster>	Phineas - how do I install the driver as specificed in the documentation for the Dell?  run ndiswrapper from terminal?
[positive]	[07:34]	<Diablo69er>	will be back later
[negative]	[07:34]	<dburger>	how do I get to this new network manager I keep reading about?

[negative]	[07:35]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Google on the make and model of the bridge?

[negative]	[07:35]	<tom__>	xtknight, sorry irc closed somehow... prob my fault
[negative]	[07:35]	<kahrytan>	Why is allot of people having problems with Feisty?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<xjkx>	does ubuntu comes with firefox?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<moDumass>	tom__ nah mine did it too
[negative]	[07:35]	<xtknight>	tom__, so everything works huh?
[positive]	[07:35]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: You and me both!
[negative]	[07:35]	<danh>	so how do i turn on the wacky compiz effects?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<kahrytan>	xjkx: yes
[neutral]	[07:35]	<eck>	kahrytan: a lot of people are using it
[neutral]	[07:35]	<moDumass>	xjkx yeh it does
[positive]	[07:35]	<Phineas>	Kellster, the ndiswrapper takes the Windows driver and wraps it making it work for Linux. The ndiswrapper wiki page should be able to walk you through the process.
[negative]	[07:35]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Why memorize what you can look up?
[positive]	[07:35]	<xtknight>	kahrytan, a lot of them are problems with the edgy->feisty upgrade.  but there ALWAYS tons of problems in here ;P
[neutral]	[07:35]	<tom_>	xtknight, it appears so
[negative]	[07:36]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: this is kinda what I awas working from, but not exactly the same goal] : @HLINK
[negative]	[07:36]	<kahrytan>	eck: Feisty works out of the box.
[neutral]	[07:36]	<tom_>	xtknight, so now I should be able to intall beryl???
[negative]	[07:36]	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to install realplayer? iv tried installing the .bin and it never works, im pretty sure i am installing it correctly also.
[neutral]	[07:36]	<xtknight>	tom_ yup.
[neutral]	[07:36]	<eoX>	phineas sweetness looks great
[positive]	[07:36]	<tom_>	xtknight, thank you so much for your help....
[positive]	[07:36]	<kahrytan>	xtknight: that problem is that people never learn. :P from Dapper-> Edgy experience.
[neutral]	[07:36]	<xtknight>	kahrytan, i'd never dist-upgrade personally
[neutral]	[07:36]	<Skiguy>	Tarkus: @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:36]	<Phineas>	Tarkus, am taking a look
[negative]	[07:36]	<xtknight>	im way too hobbiest/picky/anal/particular or however you wnat to put it
[negative]	[07:36]	<Kellster>	Phineas - that wiki page only shows how to install ndiswrapper - which worked fine.  I think i just need to do ndiswrapper -a devid driver - but not sure what devid to use, as wlan0 doesn't exist.
[negative]	[07:37]	<compwiz18>	xtknight, 512+0 records in \ 512+0 records out \ 512 bytes (512 B) copied, 0.014595 seconds, 35.1 kB/s is the output

[negative]	[07:37]	<kahrytan>	xtknight: I didn't upgrade. And I don't have separate /home partition.
[neutral]	[07:37]	<compwiz18>	xtknight, that is all
[negative]	[07:37]	<jpsamara>	Any real opensource package of virtualbox for ubuntu or debian?
[negative]	[07:37]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, ah ok ... well neutral indicator i suppose (nothing wrong nothing right)
[negative]	[07:37]	<tom_>	xtknight, I don't supose I can give you any kind of rating or vote or gold star.,.. etc for helping me on some site or anything
[negative]	[07:37]	<moDumass>	heres a question for all the ubuntu ubergeeks, whenever i try to skype with the camera i use my gf`s windows laptop, but it always sh1tz itself, could i install skype windows in wine and use the camera there?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<xtknight>	tom_, no dont worry about it.  im happy that i helped you
[neutral]	[07:38]	<Phineas>	Kellster, we're approaching my limit of knowledge...
[neutral]	[07:38]	<xtknight>	tom_,
[positive]	[07:38]	<xtknight>	just enjoy :P
[positive]	[07:38]	<liquiddoom>	moDumass: I don't see why not, it's worth a try
[negative]	[07:38]	<Phineas>	moDumass, theoretically yeah - I don't know why you couldnt
[negative]	[07:38]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, well i would attempt recovery via testdisk
[neutral]	[07:38]	<tom_>	xtknight, will do... now the gf is saying its past my bedtime g2g
[negative]	[07:38]	<Kellster>	Phineas - i understand - I'm just not sure if something else isn't wrong, given that there is no wlan0 showing in ifconfig at all - what do you think?
[negative]	[07:38]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what router are you using?
[negative]	[07:39]	<BBHoss_>	is there any publisher-type software for ubuntu?
[neutral]	[07:39]	<tom_>	xtknight, its beryl tomorrow and video codecs!!!
[negative]	[07:39]	<CarlFK>	n2diy: what are you calling a router?
[neutral]	[07:39]	<xtknight>	tom_, heh good luck youll need it
[negative]	[07:39]	<compwiz18>	xtknight, I did that three times before asking on here, but nothing happens - it tells me it was successful, to reboot, and then nothing, but I can try again
[neutral]	[07:39]	<liquiddoom>	BBHoss_: Like scribus?
[negative]	[07:39]	<moDumass>	Phineas, im going to google it and give it a try
[negative]	[07:39]	<BBHoss_>	ok good
[negative]	[07:39]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what are you trying to use as a bridge?
[positive]	[07:39]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, hrmm.  so it shows up as an 'unknown partition'...?
[negative]	[07:40]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: yeah
[positive]	[07:40]	<xtknight>	"compwiz18, that means the superblock was damaged.  the first 512 bytes of the partition are not indicating that it is 'ext3'.  or the partition table does not contain the right data.  why dont you see whta this says for sdb1.  ""sudo fdisk -l"""
[positive]	[07:40]	<liquiddoom>	BBHoss_: Scribus, Openoffice draw, and Inkscape are all good for such
[negative]	[07:40]	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what are you trying to use as a bridge? Your Ubuntu box?
[negative]	[07:40]	<Phineas>	I honestly don't know Kellster, sorry man

[negative]	[07:40]	<Kellster>	Ok - cool, phineas.  Thanks for the try.  Should I ask other here, or go to another source?

[negative]	[07:42]	<eck>	ajmorris_: you would have to change the gnome session files
[negative]	[07:42]	<ajmorris_>	eck, where are they located?
[neutral]	[07:42]	<Kellster>	Can someone help me installing Dell wireless drivers via ndiswrapper?
[negative]	[07:42]	<compwiz18>	xtknight: i have two external drives, it depends which order they powered up.  I thought it was sdb but it is actually sda, sorry if it is confusing
[neutral]	[07:42]	<neilther1>	hey  all
[negative]	[07:42]	<Amaranth>	ajmorris_: you'd have to modify the gnome-session source
[negative]	[07:42]	<Crazytom>	Kellster, what chipset is it?
[positive]	[07:42]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, ah the UUID system can help with that.  but that's far too confusing for me :p
[negative]	[07:42]	<kkathman>	i wonder if someone could please help me with some lack of sound in feisty?
[positive]	[07:42]	<CarlFK>	"n2diy: then I doubt you can be much help.  i suggest finding the part that says ""First install the necessary tools to create a network bridge, """

[negative]	[07:46]	<xtknight>	compwiz18, okay that means your partition table is fine.  ext3 superblock is corrupt.  all i can suggest is further screwing around with testdisk.  are you actually telling it to commit changes to disk?  i mean, what is it saying?  corrupt MFT/MBR?
[neutral]	[07:46]	<neilther1>	hopw can i chkdsk /?

[negative]	[07:58]	<DARKGuy>	"_3uG_: try removing all the linux-restricted-modules packages and the like, nvidia-glx and such. You could also download a script named ""Envy"" (if you give me a sec I'll get you the link) and do a full clean deinstall of the nvidia driver."
[neutral]	[07:58]	<Lunarspore>	hi all
[negative]	[07:58]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, oh.. envy is supported now? it wasn't a few days ago

[negative]	[07:59]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, i even tried the official installer.. that's when it kept saying that it couldn't install the kernel module

[negative]	[07:59]	<kkathman>	crimsun,  I executed that command... I should reboot then?
[negative]	[07:59]	<Lunarspore>	crdlb: oh?
[negative]	[07:59]	<phixnay>	is there a way to go back to edgy if feisty doesn't work very well?
[negative]	[07:59]	<Hobbsee>	Burgundavia: took 3 seconds before it actually responded to me
[negative]	[07:59]	<crdlb>	Lunarspore, it should be fixed soon, let me look it up
[positive]	[07:59]	<Madpilot>	Burgundavia, did you just show up to view the wreckage?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<Burgundavia>	tehquickness: ati is the opensource driver, fglrx is the closed source one from ATI
[positive]	[08:00]	<workbean>	phixnay: hmmm interesting question :-?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<tehquickness>	hmmm
[negative]	[08:00]	<crimsun>	kkathman: you can then either reboot, or unload all the alsa modules then reload them
[neutral]	[08:00]	<Burgundavia>	Madpilot: nah, I have it highlighted on -ops
[positive]	[08:00]	<Lunarspore>	crdlb: ah thanks :)
[negative]	[08:00]	<tehquickness>	Burgundavia, so when I use the one from ATI then I should be using the fglrx?
[negative]	[08:00]	<Kellster>	Crazytom, I'm there.
[negative]	[08:00]	<kkathman>	crimsun,  not sure how to do the unload, so maybe I reboot and that does the same thing?
[neutral]	[08:00]	<Amaranth>	yay, crimsun to the rescue
[negative]	[08:00]	<_3uG_>	"DARKGuy, it didn't say anything other than ""fatal: error installing module nvidia"""

[negative]	[08:01]	<Burgundavia>	tehquickness: you should be following the instructions at @HLINK

[positive]	[08:01]	<tehquickness>	Burgundavia, I will try that one thanks
[neutral]	[08:01]	<neilther1>	for the sony pcg-r505jl
[negative]	[08:01]	<phixnay>	workbean: since feisty switches all cdroms to sata, and not all of them will work like that, I need to go back to edgy until the bug is fixed
[positive]	[08:01]	<Burgundavia>	Amaranth: I think crimsun has alsa highlighted :)
[negative]	[08:01]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: that's okay, try running the nvidia installer with the --uninstall option. Then remove anything that looks like linux-restricted-modules and nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common too
[negative]	[08:01]	<Amaranth>	neilther1: paste the output of 'lspci | grep -i vga'
[neutral]	[08:01]	<liz>	weird
[negative]	[08:01]	<neilther1>	how can i install the driver for that?
[negative]	[08:01]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: then restart the computer, download the nvidia installer and try installing it
[positive]	[08:02]	<Burgundavia>	phixnay: no, feisty uses a different way to access ata drives, not switching them to sata

[negative]	[08:02]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, i'm working on uninstalling everything now.. what's really frustrating about this is that i had all of this nvidia hoopjumping sorted out back when debian sarge first came out =-(
[negative]	[08:02]	<Amaranth>	phixnay: it doesn't switch them to sata, it makes PATA devices use the scsi subsystem (since every other storage type uses it)

[negative]	[08:03]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, okay, i've uninstalled everything. should i reboot and try the nvidia installer again or should i try envy?
[positive]	[08:03]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: I have to reinstall the nvidia driver everytime I boot linux up, so I made a script for reinstalling it and getting back to X :P

[negative]	[08:04]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: try rebooting and then try the nvidia installer. If it doesn't work, then use envy to remove all nvidia-related, then repeat

[negative]	[08:05]	<crdlb>	DARKGuy, it sucks almost as badly as automatix, that's the problem
[neutral]	[08:06]	<neilther1>	crdlb: what can i do now/
[negative]	[08:06]	<kkathman>	crimsun,  can you give me that command again, just in case I need it?? hehe
[negative]	[08:06]	<Amaranth>	DARKGuy: the problem it is automatically installs things in a way that's not recommended
[negative]	[08:06]	<phixnay>	why do people use envy anyway? manually installing the binary drivers isn't that hard
[negative]	[08:06]	<Burgundavia>	"phixnay: it is not that hard, but envy is ""easier"""

[neutral]	[08:08]	<wizard>	crimsun: i was afk
[positive]	[08:08]	<crdlb>	DARKGuy, drivers installed with envy will break after kernel upgrades, and will most likely cause problems if you try to upgrade distro versions

[neutral]	[08:09]	<morphius_>	Madpilot: I can search for ubuntu there for instance.
[neutral]	[08:09]	<Burgundavia>	morphius_: regardless, it is off topic here
[positive]	[08:09]	<DARKGuy>	crdlb: however, I've seen it uninstalls the nvidia driver in a good way - it hasn't broke my system up. It didn't in Edgy nor it hasn't in Fawn

[negative]	[08:10]	<goban>	torrents are just another protocol, just like http, nothing bad about them

[negative]	[08:10]	<wizard>	crimsun: i recall you saying you had located it

[neutral]	[08:10]	<crimsun>	wizard: no, it's not. I've fixed it, and the fix has been committed. It will be available in the first post-release kernel upload.

[neutral]	[08:10]	<Amaranth>	neilther1: yes
[negative]	[08:10]	<Burgundavia>	dannydrifffft: afaik, there is no way. You can try and resize the window. If that doesn't work, download the alternate cd and use that
[negative]	[08:10]	<neilther1>	i should run run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg'

[negative]	[08:37]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, ...yeah?!?!
[neutral]	[08:37]	<DARKGuy>	"_3uG_: try ""sudo rmmod nvidia"""
[neutral]	[08:37]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: then run the nvidia installer again
[negative]	[08:37]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: that should do it ^^
[negative]	[08:37]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, oh geez... obvious solution
[neutral]	[08:37]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, brb, trying that
[positive]	[08:37]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: it took about 30 mins of my time, couldn't forget it ;)
[negative]	[08:38]	<Robbie_Crash>	I cannot start x because my nvidia kernel module and my nvidia driver have different versions. The driver is the latest driver, and the kernel version is the second most recent. I want to keep the latest driver, how can I fix this situation?
[negative]	[08:38]	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, i've been fighting this since about a week before feisty final was released (and my controller still won't work with my gameport)
[neutral]	[08:38]	<BaACkUp>	lag lag lag
[neutral]	[08:38]	<BaACkUp>	!Ping me

[neutral]	[08:38]	<tuskernini>	!ping
[neutral]	[08:38]	<ubotu>	pong
[negative]	[08:39]	<_3uG_>	Robbie_Crash, i'm working on the same thing right now... it looks like the best solution is to remove everything nvidia-related and linux-restricted-modules and then reboot and use the nvidia installer.. but be sure to do sudo rmmod nvidia first
[negative]	[08:39]	<DaMi3n>	can someone please tell me how do i enter a mountpoint with a space in dir name in fstab??
[positive]	[08:39]	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: hm, I dunno about controllers in gameports (except a PSX pad with the LPT1 port :P) so someone else could help you with that ^^
[neutral]	[08:39]	<Centaur5>	Can anybody tell me if Kickstart allows you to leave certain things unanswered so it will ask when you're doing an installation?
[neutral]	[08:39]	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, probably\ like\ this

[neutral]	[08:40]	<fiction>	any thoughts?
[negative]	[08:40]	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, quotes or \, not both, I suspect
[neutral]	[08:40]	<Robbie_Crash>	fiction what services?
[negative]	[08:40]	<nemo_home>	My mom's boyfriend switched off (powered off) her laptop while I was installing some stuff on it once. this damaged portions of ubuntu package manager, after some struggling I got it almost back to normal 'cept it had no clue what packages were already installed...
[negative]	[08:41]	<nemo_home>	The 7.04 update, as a result, failed with error that it had no idea what desktop was installed.
[negative]	[08:41]	<acidtabs>	Has anyone have installed urban terror that would help me to install

[negative]	[08:41]	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: sorry man, one more thing. HOw do you execute multiple command lines in that one value box?
[neutral]	[08:41]	<DaMi3n>	that doesnt work either
[positive]	[08:41]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: see above :)
[positive]	[08:42]	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: is there a special character for a new space?
[negative]	[08:42]	<Shadow_X>	would it be totally foolish to install everything from synaptic?
[negative]	[08:42]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: I'd like to avoid a manual 7.04 update, I'd like to know how to get the pretty lil' upgrade tool back
[neutral]	[08:42]	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, I think that should work..
[negative]	[08:42]	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: Are you using the feisty repos?

[positive]	[08:43]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: at the moment. probably not? it halted in the middle of upgrading, as stated. aborted on figuring out what it needed to do.

[neutral]	[08:43]	<fiction>	rofl acidtabs

[negative]	[08:43]	<endlessurf>	hey out there i lost sound when i updated to feisty, my card is a Intel Corporation 82801G and i was wondering if anyone else has had this problem or knows of a fix

[neutral]	[08:46]	<liquiddoom>	DaMi3n: If you can, that is
[negative]	[08:46]	<FernLuja1>	I Have a question on keybinding. In gconf-editor, when you're making a command, in the value textbox, how do you make multiple commands. Is there a character I should input that acts as a new line?
[negative]	[08:46]	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, last resorts :'(
[positive]	[08:46]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: sources are still edgy - mod timestamp of today, and some files in /etc/apt that look like leftovers from the aborted upgrade
[neutral]	[08:46]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: probably reverted when it aborted
[neutral]	[08:46]	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, however ubvuntu does by default mount it to a directory named /Mai\ Moosik
[negative]	[08:47]	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, you want a single keypress to run multiple commands?
[negative]	[08:47]	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: yeah
[neutral]	[08:47]	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: like update the desktop images before getting to the desktop cube
[negative]	[08:47]	<liquiddoom>	DaMi3n: I'm not too sure what to do about that oddness

[negative]	[08:48]	<Robbie_Crash>	T0uCH what's the problem?
[negative]	[08:48]	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, you could write a script then put that script in the value box

[negative]	[08:49]	<T0uCH>	Robbie_Crash:  everytime i try to enable 3d  and install nvidia ( and i have done everything whos on these help pages) the x session failed and i can only access in safe mode
[negative]	[08:49]	<ice_nine>	howdy, when using bittornado and I change preferences then restart the program the preferences get reset to default. Any idea why?
[negative]	[08:49]	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: I'm not too sure

[neutral]	[08:49]	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: I'll try to help out further tomorrow
[negative]	[08:49]	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, on the next two lines, put what you want to run
[negative]	[08:50]	<moosejaw>	how do i use live cd to fix fstab??? how do i get to the file?

[negative]	[08:50]	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Mount your root dir first
[positive]	[08:50]	<chowmeined>	Robbie_Crash: hmm, Actually deluge is looking good.. its fairly simple, uses PyGTK, at first it kind of appears to be missing features (but Azureus is so big in that way).. but it manages multiple torrents, it even has a cool scheduling plugin (you can set certain times of day/week to have the bandwidth up/down be limited)
[neutral]	[08:50]	<T0uCH>	i got a e-geforce 6200 le
[negative]	[08:50]	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: thanks. g'nite. silly installer shouldn't leave itself in an unreturnable state. but then. if he hadn't damaged the filesystem all those months ago..
[neutral]	[08:50]	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Try fdisk -l /dev/hda
[negative]	[08:50]	<zcat[1] >	T0uCH, download what? I _only_ checked the box, then restarted...
[negative]	[08:50]	<Robbie_Crash>	T0uCH what does x say when it fails?
[negative]	[08:50]	<Frogzoo>	so how stable is feisty? any big issues in the upgrade?

[negative]	[08:51]	<moosejaw>	how do i get to my HD?
[positive]	[08:51]	<zcat[1] >	that's what feisty is all about; you shouldn't have to mess with binary drivers and config files.
[negative]	[08:51]	<moosejaw>	thats what i am asking
[neutral]	[08:51]	<zeroday>	endlessdurf: Do you have a toshiba?
[negative]	[08:51]	<Wicked>	Could I possibly mount the harddrive and upgrade it through the live CD?

[negative]	[08:53]	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: how do I Make it executable???

If it absolutely doesn't exist in package-form, then you'd need to install software necessary for compiling it. But then there's nothing to track dependencies or remove it later if needed.

[negative]	[11:03]	<Draconicus>	Ggrr... can't sleep. Ended up getting out of bed because Camorama bugged me so much (I have OCD. Bear with me, please). Camorama seems to be missing its effects filters. Does anyone know why? I look blue and purple on the screen because it doesn't have the color correction. x_x

[negative]	[11:04]	<ExpositionOfEvil>	what if I lose internet connection from my router, which is right next to me?  I think its from interference from other people in my area.  What should I do?

[neutral]	[11:09]	<FreeSoul>	bye tnx
[negative]	[11:09]	<r00tintheb0x>	okay SarahDavies you found the macbook driver in a .exe file?
[neutral]	[11:09]	<`davo>	El_Burro any luck?
[negative]	[11:09]	<cheeko>	my research tells me that just editing the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list to replace all occurences of 'edgy' with 'feisty' then updating/installing through aptitude will upgrade the distro. is it really this easy, or is there something else i need to do afterwards?
[negative]	[11:09]	<r00tintheb0x>	SarahDavies, i dont have any experience with Mac hardware, im sorry.
[negative]	[11:09]	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, thats the way i do it... but it isnt reccomended.
[negative]	[11:09]	<El_Burro>	nope, just reverting my xorg.conf back now
[negative]	[11:09]	<cheeko>	why not?
[positive]	[11:09]	<r00tintheb0x>	recommended

[positive]	[11:10]	<r00tintheb0x>	that isnt the supported way cheeko
[negative]	[11:10]	<`davo>	El_Burro, let me know if you find anything

[negative]	[11:10]	<SarahDavies>	r00tintheb0x: yes, I found a tutorial that told me how to install from a .inf file, but I have to unzip the exe file somehow to do that
[negative]	[11:10]	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : well... does it Just Work?
[positive]	[11:10]	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: samba (smb) respects the underlying permissions does the user you are trying access the share with have permissions to the dirs that are shared

[positive]	[11:10]	<enry>	Amd X2 is supported by ubuntu or i have to install a kernel ad hoc (like smp)?
[neutral]	[11:10]	<fiction>	!lamp
[positive]	[11:10]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[positive]	[11:10]	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, not all the time, sometimes i have to reboot and do it again.

[positive]	[11:10]	<enry>	Amd X2 is supported by ubuntu or i have to install a kernel ad hoc (like smp)?
[neutral]	[11:10]	<SarahDavies>	orbin: yes, exactly
[neutral]	[11:10]	<El_Burro>	'davo @HLINK
[negative]	[11:10]	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, if you're comfortable with linux you shouldn't have a problem.
[neutral]	[11:11]	<orbin>	SarahDavies: cabextract should work.  are you sure you have the right driver exe?
[positive]	[11:11]	<vladi_h_>	Indeed putting reject 192.168.1.1 in dhclient.conf stopped rewriting resolve.conf and dns entries from ISP still there
[positive]	[11:11]	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i'm fairly comfortable but i never upgraded a distro, only new kernel compiles
[negative]	[11:11]	<orbin>	SarahDavies: what exactly happened?
[negative]	[11:11]	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i want to retain my configs/settings/files/etc
[negative]	[11:11]	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, any reason you dont want to use Ubuntu's update manager?
[positive]	[11:11]	<enry>	weyyy Ubuntu is good with core duo processor???
[neutral]	[11:11]	<chowmeined>	frolle: do you have dmsetup and libdevmapper installed?
[negative]	[11:11]	<nbjayme>	ah... after some research opengl version is depends on 3D video card.
[neutral]	[11:12]	<`davo>	El_Burro, it working for you?
[positive]	[11:12]	<enry>	weyyy Ubuntu is good with core duo processor??? i can buy also a single core!
[neutral]	[11:12]	<frolle>	i only typed apt-get install cryptsetup hashalot
[positive]	[11:12]	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i'm not on my linux box at the moment, i didn't know the update manager would update the distro for me :p
[positive]	[11:12]	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, system>administration>update manager.
[negative]	[11:12]	<r00tintheb0x>	yep it will cheeko
[negative]	[11:12]	<SarahDavies>	orbin:  I looked up the driver on @HLINK so I'm fairly sure I have the right one
[positive]	[11:12]	<r00tintheb0x>	:)
[negative]	[11:12]	<El_Burro>	'davo nope, but your setup might be differnt to mine
[negative]	[11:12]	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : well that's even easier, thanks
[negative]	[11:12]	<`davo>	ah
[neutral]	[11:12]	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: The directory is chmodded to 755
[negative]	[11:12]	<nubbe>	I shut down edgy without shutting down Azureus first, so now azureus starts and then dumps it's core. How do I fix this?
[negative]	[11:12]	<SarahDavies>	orbin: it says there aren't any cabinets in it

[neutral]	[11:13]	<psycop>	Hey
[neutral]	[11:13]	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: so only the owner can write ...
[negative]	[11:13]	<liquiddoom>	...I just highlighted myself. How bright.
[positive]	[11:13]	<ScottSatkin>	Is there a risk updating from dapper->feisty, skipping edgy?
[neutral]	[11:13]	<chowmeined>	frolle: is this on feisty?
[positive]	[11:13]	<psycop>	i was wondering, can yu make a partition that can be read/written on from both OS(Linux and Windows XP)
[neutral]	[11:13]	<frolle>	chowmeined: yes it is
[negative]	[11:13]	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: ok 777
[positive]	[11:14]	<velko>	ScottSatkin, i done it several times. but it is not a smooth ride
[neutral]	[11:14]	<dj-fu>	psycop: fat32
[positive]	[11:14]	<Danltn>	Psycop, I believe both Linux and Windows can read FAT32
[positive]	[11:14]	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: echo test > test.txt-bash: test.txt: Permission denied
[negative]	[11:14]	<dj-fu>	but there are some implications of fat32, you can't have files bigger than 4gb
[neutral]	[11:14]	<dj-fu>	(dvd images = out of the question)
[neutral]	[11:14]	<Danltn>	^^ That's true
[negative]	[11:14]	<psycop>	yeah not too keen about having fat32
[negative]	[11:14]	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Huh, now it doesn't even work as root
[negative]	[11:14]	<psycop>	hmm
[neutral]	[11:14]	<dj-fu>	otherwise ext3 and the ifs-ext3 driver for windows.
[neutral]	[11:15]	<psycop>	will that allow me to see the drives from windows?
[negative]	[11:15]	<kritzstapf>	what about ntfs?
[neutral]	[11:15]	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Lemme check my smb.conf and fstab, hang on

[positive]	[11:16]	<afflux>	psycop: ntfs read/write support
[neutral]	[11:16]	<J-_>	With an alternative CD, is it the same method to install as a regular cd? Boots from the RAM, and you install from an icon on the desktop? or is it totally different?
[neutral]	[11:16]	<psycop>	for linux? nice
[negative]	[11:17]	<orbin>	SarahDavies: what's the letter.number reference for your card on that list?
[positive]	[11:17]	<exzrael>	Hi, may I ask, how well do dual-screen work with Ubuntu. I have one digital and one analog working together in Windows, but does it work with ubuntu?
[neutral]	[11:17]	<SarahDavies>	orbin: 168c:0024
[negative]	[11:17]	<orbin>	J-_: alternate uses a text-based installer.  there is no desktop

[neutral]	[11:17]	<chowmeined>	frolle: and you have created the partition already?
[negative]	[11:18]	<chowmeined>	frolle: what if you just do... cryptsetup create 'name' '/path/to/block-dev'
[positive]	[11:18]	<J-_>	orbin: ah ok, cool. thanks. =)
[neutral]	[11:18]	<frolle>	chowmeined: well... i have split my dev/hda1 in 3.. The 2 other partitions are primary aswell.. i dont know if that is possbile

[negative]	[11:19]	<frolle>	chowmeined: okay..
[negative]	[11:19]	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do i do now?
[neutral]	[11:19]	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, if you have binary drivers installed all bets are off. they are black boxes and only the manufactures can help you with such issues
[negative]	[11:20]	<chowmeined>	frolle: it should have asked for a password did it?
[neutral]	[11:20]	<fiery_cleric>	Vanuatoo_: have u checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
[neutral]	[11:20]	<Danltn>	FFs
[neutral]	[11:20]	<Danltn>	I need to reinstall my Windows.
[negative]	[11:20]	<J-_>	orbin: Would it be the same concept with a dual system? ie., delete partitions, make a small win2000 partition. install it. then let Ubuntu pick up the remaining disk space for the install?
[negative]	[11:20]	<Danltn>	I have 2 HDs, If I just install WIndows to the new one, the old one won't be affected right?
[negative]	[11:20]	<frolle>	chowmeined: path/to/.. is that for example: /dev/hda2
[neutral]	[11:20]	<chowmeined>	yes

[neutral]	[11:21]	<frolle>	chowmeined: 2sec then
[negative]	[11:21]	<chowmeined>	and then 'name' can be anything.. you just give it a name
[negative]	[11:21]	<Vanuatoo_>	What should I do then
[negative]	[11:21]	<chowmeined>	frolle: like i use
[neutral]	[11:21]	<chowmeined>	frolle: cryptsetup create crypt /dev/sda3
[positive]	[11:21]	<fiery_cleric>	Danltn: i would just unplug it just in case :)
[positive]	[11:21]	<chowmeined>	frolle: it asks for a password.. which it uses to encrypt that and it shows up as /dev/mapper/crypt
[neutral]	[11:21]	<mindframe->	hows java and adobe flash support in feisty amd64 ?
[negative]	[11:21]	<orbin>	J-_: something like that.  do you have win2000 already installed?

[neutral]	[11:53]	<|ringo|>	psycop: it depends on your specific monitor
[neutral]	[11:53]	<frolle>	chowmeined: no
[negative]	[11:53]	<velko>	jacquesmerde, yes. setting repos is not related to installation (this is equivalent to editing the file /etc/apt/sources.list). so you can do it with synaptic and install with aptitude

[neutral]	[11:55]	<jacquesmerde>	velko: what advantage would aptitude have over installing apps through synaptic, and uninstalling cli with apt-get autoremove?
[negative]	[11:56]	<Stew2>	Question: Why, when I put in the cd for 7.x and liveboot from it, does it ask me for a username/password. I've not seen any reference to it, and previous versions didn't ask.
[negative]	[11:56]	<liquiddoom>	kusit912: With the webmin module, it is. I don't know about the config by hand, though

[neutral]	[12:13]	<frolle>	chowmeined: is it necessary to encrypt swap aswell? i did it on 6.10, but..?
[negative]	[12:13]	<nehuen>	I did that..I first ./configure, then make and then make install.. is that it? how do I know if the program is installed...I mean..how do I use it al all..(sorry..I'm really new at this)
[negative]	[12:13]	<clapper>	I'm a newby and just upgraded from ubuntu 6.06 to 7.04. I do a little embedded development using the gnu tools. Anyway, I power my target board with a USB cable. With the new version, the USB power levels fluctuate causing a powerfail on my target. If I reboot with the previous version Kernel (2.6.17-11-386 #2 Mar 13th) - there's no problem. Who/where do I go to post this issue? Thanks.
[negative]	[12:13]	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you feel you want that security
[negative]	[12:13]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: okay.. but i got it working by doing nothing else
[negative]	[12:13]	<paolo>	am I the only one that cannot upgrade because the softwae update doesn't shoe 7.04?
[neutral]	[12:14]	<QOOQ>	is there any wine supported list?
[negative]	[12:14]	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
[positive]	[12:14]	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do you mean by that? :)
[neutral]	[12:14]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, so i can play Counter-Strike if i only have this driver?
[negative]	[12:14]	<psycop>	I tried running WoW through Wine, only getting 70-80fps where in windows i had 200fps
[negative]	[12:14]	<chowmeined>	frolle: with swap you can even use one time keys (the data is not restored on reboot).. so it gets destroyed each time.. but this means hibernate is not available
[negative]	[12:14]	<psycop>	are there any other emu. software out there?
[neutral]	[12:14]	<impulse>	i managed to install the driver
[negative]	[12:14]	<impulse>	i will do a reboot now to see if it works
[neutral]	[12:15]	<velko>	clapper, you can report it on the ubuntu page. they will push it upstream if it's an upstream bug
[negative]	[12:15]	<muxx>	nehuen: I don't know how to run beryl
[neutral]	[12:15]	<QOOQ>	thnx
[neutral]	[12:15]	<Kaiser>	slm
[negative]	[12:15]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: i don't know anyone playing counterstrike, but i'd suppose you should.
[positive]	[12:15]	<clapper>	thanks. Ciao!
[negative]	[12:15]	<frolle>	chowmeined: i am not useing that.. so efter reboot its gone.. thats for suer?
[positive]	[12:15]	<nehuen>	ok..no problem..thanx anyway :)!
[negative]	[12:15]	<cheeko>	velko: the splash line isn't in the entry
[negative]	[12:15]	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you want to encrypt swap.. i mean if this is a laptop which carries sensitive information encrypting swap wouldn't be a bad idea
[neutral]	[12:15]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: did you restart after installing the driver?
[negative]	[12:15]	<muxx>	"nehuen: but if the compile ran without errors and the ""make install"" part was done with needed permissions, it should be installed"
[neutral]	[12:15]	<frolle>	chowmeined: its my serv.. soo..?
[positive]	[12:15]	<chowmeined>	frolle: right the setup you are using now is not one time key
[negative]	[12:15]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, do you know any one that play World of warcraft with that driver
[negative]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	velko: there's only lines for root, kernel, initrd, savedefault and then boot. no quiet or splash
[neutral]	[12:16]	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, yes i restarted my system
[neutral]	[12:16]	<slackern>	cheeko, 'kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=xxx ro quiet splash' thats how mine looks default
[neutral]	[12:16]	<velko>	"cheeko, can you post the ""kernel"" line?"
[negative]	[12:16]	<nehuen>	oh..i see..then I must have installed it...I should reboot or sth..
[negative]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	oh
[neutral]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	-_-
[positive]	[12:16]	<nehuen>	thanx muxx...I'll be nback :)
[positive]	[12:16]	<hiways85>	www.submission.org ........ Islam is the kewlest religion. join everybody. by happy.
[neutral]	[12:16]	<cheeko>	velko: it's in the kernel line, i thought it was on a seperate line
[neutral]	[12:16]	<thenetduck>	is anyone running a macbook?
[negative]	[12:16]	<chowmeined>	frolle: well if your server is locked up there is not really a point to encrypting the drives (because its only an issue when someone is trying to access the drives when the computer isnt running its normal os)
[positive]	[12:16]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: all i know is that i got beryl working, and i never did with an earlier version of ubuntu :) is there a linux wow client?
[neutral]	[12:16]	<hiways85>	be happy*
[positive]	[12:16]	<velko>	cheeko, ;-)
[negative]	[12:16]	<chowmeined>	frolle: i mean the drive encryption only stops someone from accessing your stuff if they are on a livecd or something
[negative]	[12:16]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__:  i play wow, but i didn't think i could on linux..
[neutral]	[12:17]	<drkm_>	HELP: I just installed new version of ubuntu over my old one but now my cdrom wont mount.. when I ls /dev/ there are no hda or hdb or anything I can mount.. anyone know why?
[neutral]	[12:17]	<frolle>	chowmeined: perfect.. how do i delete crypt?
[negative]	[12:17]	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
[negative]	[12:17]	<chowmeined>	frolle: umount /media/crypt; cryptsetup remove crypt
[neutral]	[12:17]	<drkm_>	slackern: ok thanks
[neutral]	[12:17]	<hobojohn3>	is there a program out for fiesty yet that is like wicd?
[positive]	[12:17]	<frolle>	chowmeined: do you have some nice bash scripts for it aswel? :)
[negative]	[12:17]	<kevin_u__>	"LegionX, Yes you can play WoW on linux, just use ""Wine"" or ""cedega"""
[neutral]	[12:18]	<velko>	hobojohn3, what is wicd?
[negative]	[12:18]	<stefg>	slackern: it's not /that/ simple... it goes back and forth, depending on wheter libata is used or not
[positive]	[12:18]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: oh.. wine.. i hoped there were a real linux client :)
[negative]	[12:18]	<stefg>	slackern: that's the reason UUID-based mounting was introduced in edgy
[neutral]	[12:19]	<slackern>	stefg, ahh i never had the problem myself, here my sata is still sdx and my dvd is still it's old hdc
[positive]	[12:19]	<hobojohn3>	velko its an easy to use wireless network manager that lets me see all available networks and yeah i forgot i dont need it anymore

[negative]	[12:19]	<kevin_u_>	No, unfortunately the havent created one.
[negative]	[12:20]	<chowmeined>	frolle: actually i don't use encryption that much.. but if you want something automated look into LUKS
[negative]	[12:20]	<kevin_u_>	LegionX, does cedega cost any money btw?
[negative]	[12:20]	<sand_storm>	i know this is a really noob question but how do i check which version of Ubuntu i have (32 or 64)
[positive]	[12:20]	<patrick_>	anyone know how to get flash working on an amd64
[negative]	[12:20]	<frolle>	chowmeined: okay.. i never made a filesystem on crypt, so how do i remove it?
[negative]	[12:20]	<kerik>	anybody who can tell me how to make a thinkpad mouse work in ubuntu?
[positive]	[12:20]	<stefg>	slackern: the CD/DVD's will still have /dev/ .... no other way possible. But be aware when you tar up a partition and put in on another. you've got to take care of the new UUID in fstab
[negative]	[12:20]	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: yes i think it does.. but i also heard that many people don't find it worth the money compared to the free wine
[negative]	[12:20]	<chowmeined>	frolle: I know you can do things like require a usb key be plugged in and stuff
[negative]	[12:20]	<Stew2>	kerik should work out of the box.

[positive]	[12:56]	<moDumass>	because google, it gives me nooooothing
[negative]	[12:56]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I think it's the same problem, why the alternate CD didn't work on my computer!
[neutral]	[12:57]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: modprob is something with the kernel drivers..
[neutral]	[12:57]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: probalby your acpi is not working

[neutral]	[12:57]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, what can I do about that?

[negative]	[12:58]	<Bonez56>	hi all, i'm getting an error when trying to start my X session. could someone please look at this and see if they can help? It looks fairly simple. Thanks! @HLINK
[negative]	[12:59]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: give me one moment . im starting my vm
[negative]	[12:59]	<ju_>	antidrugue: that the thing, there is no touchpad there..
[neutral]	[12:59]	<lefinx>	hi, how ca I install compiz plugins?
[negative]	[12:59]	<antidrugue>	Ju_: oh... then it has nothing to do with your X configuration
[negative]	[12:59]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: ok i have foundit
[negative]	[12:59]	<kerb>	isn't it possible to install feisty now without formatting? I used to just delete /usr and so on so I didn't have to back everything else up since I haven't partioned things that neatly
[neutral]	[01:00]	<antidrugue>	Ju_: that's from upgrading to feisty?
[neutral]	[01:00]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: when the bootloader of the cd appears you must Press F6
[positive]	[01:00]	<ju_>	antidrugue: yes, the very first day it was released
[negative]	[01:00]	<Bonez56>	hi all, i'm getting an error when trying to start my X session. could someone please look at this and see if they can help? It looks fairly simple. Thanks! @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:00]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, it's not the CD, I installed feisty with the desktop CD which worked fine.
[neutral]	[01:00]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: its installed already ?
[neutral]	[01:01]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: then press File booting ESC and e to edit the boot line of grub
[neutral]	[01:01]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: perhaps the module ""evdev"" is not loaded ?"
[neutral]	[01:02]	<ju_>	antidrugue: how to I assert that
[neutral]	[01:02]	<ju_>	?
[neutral]	[01:02]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. What I meant before, is that it's showing the same behavior as the alternate CD did.
[negative]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : you need 2 modules
[neutral]	[01:02]	<kevin_u_>	Is the wine package in synaptic when you install ubuntu 7.04?  because if its not i want to remove the package but i dont know how
[neutral]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: ""sudo modprobe psmouse"" and ""sudo modprobe evdev"""
[positive]	[01:02]	<MoxJet>	What is the command to see which packages you have installed with aptitude?
[neutral]	[01:02]	<ju_>	antidrugue: done
[positive]	[01:02]	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : then check out again in /proc/bus/input/devices
[neutral]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: the live cd worked and the installation but the alternate doesn't ?
[neutral]	[01:03]	<MonsieurBon>	"aatdark, edit the recovery mode line which sais ""kernel ....."" and added ""noacpi"" after ""ro single"". Right?"
[positive]	[01:03]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes, the live CD worked fine.
[neutral]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: y
[neutral]	[01:03]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can also cahnge ro single => in ro debug
[negative]	[01:03]	<ju_>	antidrugue: the output is the same : @HLINK maybe I don't know how to spot it
[neutral]	[01:04]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon;: then press b to boot
[negative]	[01:04]	<MonsieurBon>	"aatdark, same problem with noacpi. The las line now is usually ""[ <some number>]  usb 3-3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice"
[neutral]	[01:04]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you also added ro debug ?
[negative]	[01:05]	<moDumass>	hmmm, how do i make torrent open torrent files?
[neutral]	[01:05]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. same output
[negative]	[01:05]	<kerb>	this is annoying, I could always just delete all the linux specific files before and install ubuntu, now I have to copy everything that's not partitioned off onto a secondary disk just so I can install ubuntu :/
[neutral]	[01:06]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: is your pc a notebook ?
[negative]	[01:06]	<moDumass>	by torrent i mean Ktorrent
[neutral]	[01:06]	<compengi>	MoxJet, try aptitude show
[neutral]	[01:06]	<potera>	esto q es
[negative]	[01:06]	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : this guy seems to have the same problem: @HLINK
[positive]	[01:06]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, no. it works fine on my notebook from which I write to you!
[negative]	[01:07]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can tray nousb instead of noacpi
[negative]	[01:07]	<MoxJet>	compengi no output from aptitude show
[neutral]	[01:07]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I did a dist-upgrade from edgy which worked. now after a reinstall it doesn't.
[neutral]	[01:07]	<compengi>	MoxJet, read man aptitude
[negative]	[01:07]	<YNWA>	How do I resize a partition using Gparted? It doesn't let me
[negative]	[01:08]	<antidrugue>	"Ju_: so adding ""SendCoreEvents"" should be the solution"
[neutral]	[01:08]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: after the distupgrade you have hdd to entries in grub for 2 different kernels , right ?
[negative]	[01:08]	<velko>	YNWA, you started it as root?
[negative]	[01:08]	<YNWA>	velko: please explain
[positive]	[01:08]	<edlin>	wireless finally works for me in ubuntu hurray
[positive]	[01:08]	<YNWA>	I clicked on it and it opened :)
[negative]	[01:08]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes, 2.6.17-something and 2.6.20-15. nousb gives the same result
[neutral]	[01:08]	<velko>	"YNWA, ""gksu gparted"" or ""sudo gparted"" ?"
[neutral]	[01:09]	<YNWA>	velko:it was more <system>-<administration>-<gparted>
[neutral]	[01:09]	<velko>	YNWA, did it asked for a password?
[neutral]	[01:09]	<YNWA>	yes
[negative]	[01:09]	<frolle>	How do i search in a folder in the terminal?
[negative]	[01:10]	<velko>	YNWA, ok so this is not the problem
[negative]	[01:10]	<velko>	"YNWA, what do you mean by ""not letting me""?"
[negative]	[01:10]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon : @HLINK => your problem is known ..im still searching
[negative]	[01:10]	<YNWA>	velko:is it true that I can only resize if I unmount?
[negative]	[01:10]	<Stormx2>	frolle: What do you mean? Theres a few ways..
[negative]	[01:10]	<velko>	YNWA, i guess so
[negative]	[01:11]	<YNWA>	"well, the ""not letting me"" bit is that it doesn't let me unmount the ext3 partition"
[negative]	[01:11]	<Zancat>	how much RAM would you guys recommend Feisty run on?
[negative]	[01:11]	<BlueStorm>	does someone have Stepmania on linux?
[negative]	[01:11]	<velko>	YNWA, so some program is using a file on this partition and therefore you can't unmount it
[negative]	[01:11]	<impulse>	unfortunately still no luck with ATi driver
[positive]	[01:11]	<surviver>	anyone that can help me with devilspie
[neutral]	[01:11]	<velko>	YNWA, you have to find out which program is this
[neutral]	[01:11]	<impulse>	followed the instrucions at ATI linux driver wiki
[positive]	[01:12]	<YNWA>	I'm running ubuntu on it...? :)
[neutral]	[01:12]	<BlueStorm>	what's the command to see what is my graphic card?
[negative]	[01:12]	<frolle>	Stormx2, i want to find some files on my hardrive.. i need to delete them
[neutral]	[01:12]	<velko>	YNWA, oho...
[neutral]	[01:12]	<Freduardo>	BlueStorm, lspci
[positive]	[01:12]	<YNWA>	velko: it is the ext3 partition
[neutral]	[01:12]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon do you have a SATA Harddrive ?
[negative]	[01:12]	<velko>	YNWA, if this is your / or /home partition you have to do it from the livecd
[neutral]	[01:12]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, no, IDE
[positive]	[01:13]	<YNWA>	velko: oh, thanks :)
[neutral]	[01:13]	<neosb>	hey! wher can i find instalation folder of open office?
[negative]	[01:13]	<ju_>	antidrugue: same error :( ...
[neutral]	[01:13]	<Stormx2>	"frolle: You could use ""locate"" for that..."
[neutral]	[01:13]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: after the upgrade which option (in grub) did you choose to boot ?
[neutral]	[01:13]	<Stormx2>	"frolle: Or ""find"""
[neutral]	[01:13]	<surviver>	!devilspie
[positive]	[01:13]	<ubotu>	devilspie is a tool that performs actions on windows in GNOME's metacity such as resizing, positioning, and pinning.  Usage information can be found at @HLINK

[negative]	[01:13]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I did not change anything in grub then. No idea, what options were set.
[positive]	[01:14]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, the new one
[neutral]	[01:14]	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: and it worked ?
[neutral]	[01:14]	<rambo3>	!ext4
[negative]	[01:14]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ext4 - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:14]	<antidrugue>	Ju_: well i am a bit short of ideas now, perhaps you can read this for inspiration @HLINK
[positive]	[01:15]	<Zancat>	man, the servers are STILL busy
[negative]	[01:15]	<antidrugue>	Ju_: i know my touchpad didn't work after installing Feisty, but I just had to add the relevant section to my xorg.conf and it did afterwards, but your case seems more complicated
[positive]	[01:15]	<MonsieurBon>	"aatdark, yes. New infos: after a long while it goes further than the USB. Now the last line is: [ 218.769080]  sd 0:0:0:3: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0"" and then the BusyBox line again."

[neutral]	[01:19]	<umop>	Lcarsdata, fair enough.
[negative]	[01:19]	<velko>	Lcarsdata, just curious - why would you want to do this?
[negative]	[01:19]	<rambo3>	click and run i guess
[neutral]	[01:19]	<Lcarsdata>	velko: because debian isn't as good as ubuntu
[neutral]	[01:20]	<l4yer>	hi
[positive]	[01:20]	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I might do a clean install of edgy with just the basic system and then dist-upgrade to feisty, to see if it works.
[negative]	[01:20]	<l4yer>	"how can I install xubuntu on ubuntu?^^"""
[negative]	[01:20]	<Lcarsdata>	velko: I tried ubuntu, then thought Debian was better then it turns out ubuntu was
[negative]	[01:20]	<velko>	Lcarsdata, what do you mean by that?

[negative]	[01:54]	<Impaque>	gandalfcome: port range is not any different than, say, single port. iprange is the name of the iptables module. then, you mark those packets, which in turn, you shape with tc.

[negative]	[01:58]	<IdleOne>	Cam30077, goto. packages.ubuntu.com and look for gparted then download and save. then go to the comp with ubuntu and use dpkg - i package-name.deb to install it

[neutral]	[02:00]	<IdleOne>	Cam30077, replace package-name.deb with actual file name
[neutral]	[02:00]	<slackern>	libcairomm-1.0-1 , libglibmm-2.4-1c2a , libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a , gparted are the packages needed to install gparted

[positive]	[02:56]	<steharg79_>	it doesnt show in the add/remove or synaptic
[negative]	[02:56]	<OiPenguinn>	Yes, but thats not an option either. Maybe because I'm not logged in as root?

[positive]	[03:28]	<LjL>	assasukasse: yes, though i brought it with me from edgy

[negative]	[03:28]	<The_wrath>	velko: maybe mine doesnt have one than )=
[neutral]	[03:28]	<jrib>	The_wrath: hmm, depends on your keyboard.  mine is above Enter and the symbol on the keyboard is actually broken in half

[negative]	[03:29]	<The_wrath>	linxeh: Thanks, found it. They didnt label it on mine for some reason
[negative]	[03:30]	<assasukasse>	LjL: i did install beta 4 and upgraded from then
[negative]	[03:30]	<LjL>	assasukasse: i really doubt that readahead has much to do with the poor performance increase from prelink. you know, prelink and preload are the kind of things that some people swear on, and other people say they didn't notice any difference
[positive]	[03:30]	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: well, network manager
[negative]	[03:30]	<velko>	MacPointMan, ok. but sorry - i have no further ideas how to improve the playback. maybe try another player?
[negative]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	exzrael: by default ubuntu doesnt use the root account, so you cannot su to root. you can su to other users though
[negative]	[03:30]	<stefg>	tom1502: yeak, that's the problem
[neutral]	[03:30]	<LjL>	assasukasse: in that case, a profile won't hurt - though, don't expect *huge* boot-time improvements
[positive]	[03:30]	<MacPointMan>	Velko.  Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate it.
[negative]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	The_wrath: odd - i've never seen a keyboard without the pipe symbol

[positive]	[03:30]	<linxeh>	The_wrath: sometimes it is two vertical bars stacked on top of each other
[negative]	[03:30]	<assasukasse>	LjL: so i should just add option profile on grub menu.lst?
[negative]	[03:30]	<MacPointMan>	Velko I think It has something to do with a Beryl Setting.  Ill have to check it out.

[negative]	[04:22]	<shockwave1>	I am curious if fiesty is what people had hoped for, and really worth upgrading to. i only got to use it a little, but it didn't seem to different from edgy

[positive]	[04:23]	<magnetron>	shockwave1: it does more of the work by itself, and it is more stable + it has nice looks
[neutral]	[04:23]	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, clean install or upgrade?
[neutral]	[04:24]	<Blubloblu>	xtknight:upgrade
[neutral]	[04:24]	<joseaa__>	what is the terminal command to list all running process ?
[negative]	[04:24]	<shockwave1>	I did notice that more things seemed to work out of the box. wireless for example
[neutral]	[04:24]	<LjL>	joseaa__: ps aux
[neutral]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, that could be your problem.  feisty uses different facilities than edgy in some cases.  for example, libata is now used for IDE.  and i dont think in the upgrade the fstab is updated..
[negative]	[04:24]	<shockwave1>	what happened with cnr? are they still planning to add it?
[negative]	[04:24]	<xtknight>	does an upgrade purge or just simply remove old packages?  what happens to your fstab for example?
[neutral]	[04:24]	<mhykgyver>	dxdemetriou, ur the man...it worked perfectly..thank you soo much
[negative]	[04:24]	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: the hard drive problem is fixed, but now my drivers and xorg.conf are messed up

[neutral]	[04:26]	<IowaDave>	pimp1984: check md5 on the download
[negative]	[04:26]	<babo>	safe to run that is. It's not going to 'convert' anything ....

[neutral]	[05:22]	<Krige^>	velko: yes, /etc/ is a directory, so?

[positive]	[05:22]	<sldkfj>	the auto-eject throws the cd around that it get caught between the tray tabs and the top of the slot and runs the risk of a potential scratch on the surface.

[negative]	[05:28]	<krux0>	kirge^:  sudo -i  that should allow you to write to /etc/ and /opt...but you also might want to check if the filesystems were mounted with rw permissions...so run  mount and look at the mount points of the respective directories to see if that's the problem
[neutral]	[05:29]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, are YOU still here? lol

[neutral]	[05:32]	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, The internet wouldn't function after I switched from wireless to cable. After a reboot, the package can be be removed.

[neutral]	[05:33]	<xtknight>	where does nvidia.ko come from in Feisty
[negative]	[05:33]	<xtknight>	cuz it's not in restricted modules
[negative]	[05:33]	<xtknight>	is it built on the fly?
[negative]	[05:33]	<Krige^>	debaser, krux0, LjL, velko: I wonder how could a computer novice cope with all this complex stuff, I just wanted to make my file sharing applications to work
[positive]	[05:33]	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, It is, I think it is due to the fact that it looks for the wired ethernet and it is not up while using the wireless connection.
[negative]	[05:33]	<Bartcelon2>	now is it best to keep re asking the question or is that rude and anoying
[negative]	[05:33]	<delire>	sorcerer: that's right.. are you sure your root directory is where all those quake files are? how about try that command but with /home instead of /root?
[negative]	[05:34]	<Krige^>	LjL: it mentions a procedure to update and save the iptables

[negative]	[05:34]	<debaser>	Krige^: I've just entered the channel, I dunno what you're talking about
[neutral]	[05:34]	<blubloblu>	xtknight: it still looks for linux-restricted modules
[negative]	[05:34]	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, Now I will try re-installing it with the wired ethernet plugged in and see if that solves the problem here.
[negative]	[05:34]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, what do you mean?
[neutral]	[05:34]	<kbrooks>	Bartcelon2, patience is a virtue

[neutral]	[05:35]	<platman>	antFlo: I think you have to download the RPM package for Kiba dock and convert it to deb using alien.
[neutral]	[05:35]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, yea
[negative]	[05:35]	<delire>	sorcerer: that sounds more like it..
[negative]	[05:35]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, did you try reinstalling that pkg?
[negative]	[05:35]	<platman>	either that or you can build it yourself pretty easily
[neutral]	[05:35]	<dooglus>	Krige^: the 'sudo' bit only applies to the stuff up to the '>'

[neutral]	[05:36]	<sorcerer>	delire:  here can you take a look at this @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:36]	<dooglus>	Krige^: it means you get root's environment, not yours

[neutral]	[05:37]	<matkix0s>	!beryl
[negative]	[05:37]	<krux0>	Krige^: It is not complex. It is rather simple if you ask me. If writing or reading is not allow to a directory. Check your user permissions, if they grant writing permission then the next step  would be to check if the directory was mounted read-only because that is the only case where a filesystem might not let you write to a directory even if you do have the correct permissions
[positive]	[05:37]	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[positive]	[05:37]	<Krige^>	dooglus, debaser: I think the -i option it's the best solution
[negative]	[05:37]	<dooglus>	"Krige^: then ""exit"" to get out of the root shell"
[negative]	[05:37]	<xtknight>	can someone explain how nvidia.ko gets placed in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/volatile?  no pkg name is coming up as containing nvidia.ko.
[negative]	[05:37]	<delire>	sorcerer: you've got your home directory and all of the ubuntu system directory in the same partition. not hard to believe that would all come to 11Gb

[negative]	[05:43]	<Krige^>	dooglus: in fact aMule and Azureus didn't work until I wrote the proper rules to release their ports
[negative]	[05:43]	<BlackAnthrax>	i am having some troubles lately. i used edgy for the longest, and now in feisty, there *seems to be a problem with feisty and my router, the internet works fine, but about every six minutes, it pops up and tells me no address, then i have to wait abou 10 seconds for it to reconnect to the network. i tried hooking up my pc straight to the modem, and right now it is working without deconnecting. and known issues with linksys r
[neutral]	[05:43]	<sorcerer>	delire: where you from
[neutral]	[05:43]	<antidrugue>	dager: asound.conf is not needed since dapper...
[neutral]	[05:43]	<robdeman>	LjL: hey I have otrs2 working... manually editted the httpd conf
[negative]	[05:43]	<Aiwuu>	if there is a way to fix that... i want to know, because i dont want to download again the alternate cd because i have a slow conection :/
[negative]	[05:43]	<dooglus>	Krige^: Azureus doesn't need any ports open to work - it just works a bit faster if people can connect
[neutral]	[05:43]	<blubloblu>	xtknight: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:44]	<Krige^>	dooglus: is this in Ubuntu only?
[positive]	[05:44]	<delire>	sorcerer: all over the place ;)

[neutral]	[05:44]	<sorcerer>	delire: lol really mate where you from
[neutral]	[05:44]	<sky_shark>	but I don'know how to use them
[negative]	[05:44]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: I suppose you're using DHCP, do  you have that problem with any other PC?
[negative]	[05:44]	<zaz>	dager: there is nothing in sudo gedit asound.conf, any other suggestions
[neutral]	[05:44]	<sky_shark>	I apologize for not replying ealier I was on another window
[neutral]	[05:44]	<antidrugue>	dooglus: Azureus can do UDP, but it does need permission to do those UDP request
[negative]	[05:44]	<Krige^>	dooglus: well, isn't it obvious that a user want any software to run faster?
[neutral]	[05:44]	<blubloblu>	sky_shark: you're in nano, a command line text editor
[negative]	[05:45]	<debaser>	"Aiwuu: please answer me, when does it say ""error""?"
[negative]	[05:45]	<sky_shark>	okay
[negative]	[05:45]	<sky_shark>	so how do I save and exit?

[negative]	[05:45]	<sky_shark>	okay
[positive]	[05:45]	<sky_shark>	thank you
[negative]	[05:45]	<blubloblu>	sky_shark: to save and exit Control+X
[neutral]	[05:45]	<BlackAnthrax>	um...well, it worked fine, everything, my other computer, and our xboxes hooked up to the router as well, but now in feisty it seems to be messing up addresses and then everything (other computer, xboxes) mess up. they all have to reconnect
[neutral]	[05:45]	<cotton>	@HLINK
[negative]	[05:45]	<dooglus>	Krige^: when I say 'faster', I don't mean the program runs faster, I mean it downloads faster.  I don't want that - it downloads plenty fast enough already.  I have to slow it down to stop it hogging the whole connection as it is.
[negative]	[05:45]	<delire>	sorcerer: i like to avoid talking about myself in IRC..
[negative]	[05:45]	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: that was to you
[positive]	[05:45]	<sky_shark>	great it worked thanks blubloblu
[negative]	[05:45]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, this honesly doesn't make sense
[negative]	[05:45]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: so you get some lines of information (with the GRUB commands and then the error)?
[negative]	[05:46]	<Aiwuu>	maybe 2, or 3...
[negative]	[05:46]	<poningru>	dooglus: what are you trying to do?
[negative]	[05:46]	<Aiwuu>	or 1
[negative]	[05:46]	<blubloblu>	xtknight: whats happening?
[neutral]	[05:46]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, nvidia loads fine...then it gets spontaneously deleted?

[neutral]	[05:46]	<Aiwuu>	i dont remember... may i look?
[positive]	[05:46]	<blubloblu>	xtknight: fun
[neutral]	[05:46]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: check the DHCP configuration in your feisty
[negative]	[05:46]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, i may suggest a reinstall.  nvidia.ko doesnt just get deletd out of the blue
[negative]	[05:46]	<sorcerer>	delire: oh ok i understand iam pretty new to irc as well
[neutral]	[05:46]	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: how?
[negative]	[05:46]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: go ahead
[negative]	[05:46]	<dooglus>	poningru: I'm trying to tell Krige^ that ubuntu's default firewall configuration is 'everything allowed' and that he shouldn't need to add any special rules to get filesharing working.
[negative]	[05:46]	<sorcerer>	delire: anything i should know of?
[neutral]	[05:47]	<poningru>	hehe
[negative]	[05:47]	<xtknight>	"blubloblu, actually you could try ""nv"" drivers :"

[neutral]	[05:47]	<Aiwuu>	be right back
[negative]	[05:47]	<dooglus>	poningru: in fact I have managed to tell him that a couple of times, but he won't believe me.
[negative]	[05:47]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, unless you need 3d..
[neutral]	[05:47]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: open a console and execute 'ifconfig'
[neutral]	[05:47]	<blubloblu>	xtknight: lets give them a go
[negative]	[05:47]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, 'nvidia' is pointless
[neutral]	[05:47]	<xtknight>	blubloblu, just change driver to nv and pray
[positive]	[05:47]	<dooglus>	poningru: maybe you could tell him too?  :)
[negative]	[05:47]	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: what am i looking for?

[negative]	[05:47]	<foug>	has anyone tried installing WoW in feisty yet? I'm following a guide and it isn't working
[neutral]	[05:47]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: the IP address
[positive]	[05:47]	<bradyc>	Yeah, eventually I'll go back to the nvidia drivers, but right now I'm stuck at 800x600 because of them... :-(
[negative]	[05:47]	<Krige^>	dooglus: but Azureus complained it was blocked by the firewall, I am using a brand new 7.04, didn't touch anything
[negative]	[05:47]	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: is that the inet addr?
[negative]	[05:47]	<poningru>	dooglus, Krige^ well the firewall there is none, just no programs that do incoming i.e no servers
[neutral]	[05:48]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: y
[neutral]	[05:48]	<poningru>	Krige^: do you have a router?
[negative]	[05:48]	<Krige^>	poningru: yeah
[positive]	[05:48]	<dooglus>	"Krige^: ""sudo iptables -L"" will show you the firewall rules"
[neutral]	[05:48]	<antidrugue>	krige: your router perhaps
[neutral]	[05:48]	<Krige^>	poningru: I already verified it redirects the ports to it
[positive]	[05:48]	<poningru>	Krige^: well you have to open a port for azureus to accept incoming rules
[negative]	[05:48]	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: i have it, what do i do with it?
[negative]	[05:48]	<dooglus>	"Krige^: you should see a bunch of lines like ""Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)"" - with 'ACCEPT' being the important word"
[negative]	[05:48]	<antidrugue>	feisty doesn't have a firewall installed by default
[neutral]	[05:48]	<Krige^>	poningru: already done that and checked
[neutral]	[05:48]	<tmgomez>	morning all
[negative]	[05:48]	<debaser>	Krige^: then it's surely an iptables problem or local firewall, not router
[neutral]	[05:49]	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: tall it to me
[neutral]	[05:49]	<poningru>	Krige^: can you try deluge and see if that works?

[positive]	[05:50]	<Krige^>	poningru: ah, I thought it was a verb :) why should I use deluge in place of Azureus? Is that the advised torrent application in Ubuntu?

[negative]	[06:31]	<darnell>	 You need to have CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER compiled either into the kernel, or as a module, in your kernel config. Located in Device Drivers -> USB support -> USB Gadget support -> Ethernet Gadget

[positive]	[06:31]	<void^>	kbrooks: for example: if you have a system with only 256mb memory it might make the system faster to swap out firefox when you don't use it right now, but it means you'll have to live with a delay when you switch back to firefox. swappiness allows you to control that.

[positive]	[07:24]	<debaser>	VoX: if anyone here can help you look in the documentation at the proftpd homepage, as well as the documentation provided with it.
[neutral]	[07:24]	<ffm>	Hi, I think my PASSIVE FTP is not working...
[neutral]	[07:24]	<rbs-tito>	Dante123: the driver are probably not installed properly, try theNDISwrapper route.
[neutral]	[07:24]	<Artemis3>	Alexiel, /usr/bin/mozilla-thunderbird
[positive]	[07:24]	<qebab>	antidrugue: it's more that I wanted to use what I'm already familiar with if it wouldn't be hard to set up :) I've got no problem using another IDE if I have to
[positive]	[07:25]	<Alexiel>	Thanks Artemis3
[negative]	[07:25]	<delire>	Dante123: is it the WG111v2?
[neutral]	[07:25]	<qebab>	delire: Kdevelop is good?
[negative]	[07:25]	<noelferreira>	how can i undo ldconfig comand?
[neutral]	[07:25]	<joeamined>	hi
[negative]	[07:25]	<joeamined>	i have a very annoying problem
[neutral]	[07:25]	<Dante123>	yes delire...it is
[neutral]	[07:25]	<qebab>	I'll take a look at it
[neutral]	[07:25]	<joeamined>	i installed ubuntu feisty from the live cd
[negative]	[07:25]	<andi5>	noelferreira: i do not think that is possible
[positive]	[07:25]	<joeyj>	andi5: thanks.
[neutral]	[07:25]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:25]	<joeamined>	and i get the error failed to set locale
[neutral]	[07:25]	<Dante123>	any suggestions?
[negative]	[07:25]	<delire>	qebab: i use Vim but have heard VS users say that it's the closest to a replacement in Linux.
[positive]	[07:25]	<antidrugue>	qebab: eclipse is quite nice, please very popular in enterprise
[neutral]	[07:26]	<root___>	hi
[neutral]	[07:26]	<alej82>	pano.org
[neutral]	[07:26]	<rbs-tito>	Does anyone know of some good photo printing software?
[negative]	[07:26]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: are you sure there wasn't any problem with the installation of feisty
[neutral]	[07:26]	<debaser>	?
[negative]	[07:26]	<mirak>	I have a problem with feisty on ppc, X server fail to start with my radeon8500
[negative]	[07:26]	<delire>	qebab: true, Eclipse is another option. i develop in Python, C and C++ for Linux and use Vim, but it's not for everyone :/
[negative]	[07:26]	<joeyj>	qebab: what kind of development are you doing?
[positive]	[07:26]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, interesting, btw never use wep, its as unsafe as using no encryption ;)
[neutral]	[07:26]	<Dante123>	i don't want to use ndiswrapper....if the card was working fine under edgy....with native stuff
[negative]	[07:26]	<tuna>	does anyone have problems with sound on an imac?
[negative]	[07:26]	<noelferreira>	andi5: are you sure andi5? so all the links outside /usr/lib are broken isn't it?
[negative]	[07:26]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, no problems :S
[neutral]	[07:26]	<mirak>	delire: there cdt a plugin for eclipse to edit c and c++
[negative]	[07:27]	<qebab>	joeyj: nothing in specific (haskell, python, learning c++) as a hobby
[negative]	[07:27]	<andi5>	noelferreira: huh? why that?
[negative]	[07:27]	<mirak>	I have a problem with feisty on ppc, X server fail to start with my radeon8500
[neutral]	[07:27]	<antidrugue>	exactly, eclipse-cdt
[negative]	[07:27]	<Aiwuu>	"debaser, maybe this line: root		(hd1,0) ?"
[negative]	[07:27]	<delire>	mirak: yes i've heard. i just don't like Eclipse
[neutral]	[07:27]	<qebab>	so it's not an 'enteprise' need or anything like that
[neutral]	[07:27]	<mirak>	delire: how dare you ?
[positive]	[07:27]	<Dante123>	Artemis3.....like a padlock.....it keeps the honest crooks out.........that's about all I expect from it.
[positive]	[07:27]	<Faolchu>	Is there a way to have a list of users available in a drop-down menu at the login window?
[negative]	[07:27]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, maybe if i change to (sd2,0)?
[positive]	[07:27]	<delire>	mirak: hehe, i've been using Vim for around 8 years now. you can pry it from my cold dead hands.
[neutral]	[07:27]	<antidrugue>	delire: blasphemy
[neutral]	[07:27]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, not really, check the proggies to crack into a wep wifi...
[positive]	[07:27]	<qebab>	and you are quite right delire, emacs and vim don't seem to be my thing :) a bit too strange for me still
[negative]	[07:27]	<noelferreira>	because i do that and know i can't run some programs that need some librarys files andi5
[positive]	[07:27]	<oo_seven>	can somebody suggest an easy to configure, lightweight http proxy server & dns server (that will just forward the dns requests) ?
[neutral]	[07:27]	<sigfever>	i need a recommendation for a good firewall
[neutral]	[07:27]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: grub doesn't manage the disks the same as linux
[neutral]	[07:27]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[neutral]	[07:27]	<mirak>	delire: vim is for cavemans
[negative]	[07:28]	<joeyj>	qebab: in that case, i agree with the others... i think eclipse (+cdt) would be good for you
[negative]	[07:28]	<MoxJet>	i'm installing vmware server but I get an error doing /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl about not having a vmmon module... this is what i get @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:28]	<rbs-tito>	sigfever: firestarter?
[positive]	[07:28]	<qebab>	though I am sure they are very good when you get used to it
[negative]	[07:28]	<qebab>	okay
[negative]	[07:28]	<Dante123>	delire.....what do you know about netgear wg111v2?
[negative]	[07:28]	<qebab>	I'll try that
[negative]	[07:28]	<delire>	mirak: antidrugue i tried Eclipse, but found it too bulky and unneccessarily confusing.
[neutral]	[07:28]	<qebab>	thanks guys
[negative]	[07:28]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, :/
[negative]	[07:28]	<ffm>	HOW CAN I tell if my camera works w/ linux>?
[negative]	[07:28]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can try it, but first make sure it's correct
[negative]	[07:28]	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
[negative]	[07:28]	<sizzam>	if you add something to hosts.deny, do you have to source the file or something for it to go into effect?
[positive]	[07:28]	<sigfever>	thanks
[neutral]	[07:28]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: surely it is.
[positive]	[07:28]	<andi5>	noelferreira: i think that typically every installation of a library ends with running `ldconfig', so i do not understand that :)
[negative]	[07:28]	<delire>	Dante123: i know that people have problems with this particular model. is it the same as yours?
[positive]	[07:28]	<antidrugue>	delire: just joking, i like VIM too, but i believe it many not be very efficient for large project
[neutral]	[07:29]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can check the documentation of GRUB.
[neutral]	[07:29]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[negative]	[07:29]	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
[neutral]	[07:29]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:29]	<neilther1>	delire: after unning that command, my computer isn booting anymore
[positive]	[07:29]	<delire>	antidrugue: i've coded a few biggish projects in Vim and found it fine with a good code browser, like ctags.
[positive]	[07:29]	<Faolchu>	Is there a way to have a list of users available in a drop-down menu at the login window?
[negative]	[07:29]	<MonsieurBon>	can i remove laptop-detect and laptop-mode-tools on a desktop??
[negative]	[07:29]	<joeamined>	how can i fix that ?
[positive]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: what command?
[neutral]	[07:29]	<Artemis3>	harris, cron?
[negative]	[07:29]	<Crav>	has anyone tried the mozilla calender program (sunbird)?
[negative]	[07:29]	<Dante123>	Artemis3...you are missing my point......I put wep simply to keep my neighbour from using my wifi.......you know......as for some hacking neighbour....well.....they'd probably crack anything anyway....and there are few if any like that in my hood....now what about netgear usb
[negative]	[07:29]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but I think that if the problem was with that, it should then appear another error (at least that happened to me).
[negative]	[07:29]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you sure your CD is good?
[positive]	[07:29]	<neilther1>	touch /forcefsck
[positive]	[07:29]	<qebab>	antidrugue: one of my friend usually says that Vim is for sys admin kinds of people, emacs is for crazy people and always adds as an afterthought that he uses emacs :)
[negative]	[07:29]	<dor>	Crav, I did
[neutral]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: i never told you to run that.
[neutral]	[07:29]	<ffm>	Crav: I reccomend Thunderbird w/ sunbird addon. Or GoogleCal.
[negative]	[07:29]	<delire>	neilther1: read the backlog
[negative]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	whats that.
[neutral]	[07:30]	<Faolchu>	v_v
[neutral]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<harris>	how?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<harris>	Artemis3: how?
[positive]	[07:30]	<andi5>	harris: do you need precision? ... while true; do do_upload ; sleep 10 ; done loop might work as well
[neutral]	[07:30]	<antidrugue>	ouak, emacs, euhhh
[negative]	[07:30]	<Crav>	ffm: is the addon like a plugin, or a wholly seperate program?
[negative]	[07:30]	<delire>	neilther1: all i told you was to install libnewt. you're confused with someone else.
[negative]	[07:30]	<abtinf>	can someone point me in the right direction... i have a fresh install of fiesty. During boot, it reaches the screen where the filling bar indicates boot progress. Every time, it reaches about a third of the way and becomes non-responsive. I can then make it move by pressing ctrl+alt+del (other keys seem to have no effect). Is there a way i can turn on logging or get rid of the graphical screen to see what is actually happening?
[positive]	[07:30]	<andi5>	harris: i mean 600, of course :)
[positive]	[07:30]	<ffm>	Crav: It is an extention.
[negative]	[07:30]	<harris>	I don't need precision
[negative]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	delire: do u know what to do now?
[positive]	[07:30]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but it works with windows doesn't it?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<Crav>	ffm: alright, thanks a lot, i'll check out both options
[negative]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, but i only get: Error 17: cannot mount selected partition :S and please hit any key.... and then im in grub again :S
[neutral]	[07:30]	<neilther1>	why its not booting after i ran that?
[negative]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, nope
[neutral]	[07:30]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, your neighbour can use your wep as if you had used no encryption, determined people will have very hard time with wap/wap2 (psk or not) if you use a decent password
[positive]	[07:30]	<ffm>	Crav: They will be able to help you better at irc.mozilla.org #firefox or #thunderbird.
[neutral]	[07:30]	<harris>	Could you repeat that command?
[negative]	[07:30]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, i load windows from the hd
[negative]	[07:31]	<Dante123>	i have another usb wifi adapter.....I ll try it.....it uses zyxes or something like that....
[neutral]	[07:31]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, and linux from de sd
[neutral]	[07:31]	<Tarkus>	anyone know how if helix player can read all the media types that VLC can?
[negative]	[07:31]	<Pitel_laptop>	what's the name of the packeg for psi ssl support?
[neutral]	[07:31]	<andi5>	harris: while true; do do_upload ; sleep 600 ; done
[positive]	[07:31]	<harris>	Thank you.
[negative]	[07:31]	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
[negative]	[07:31]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, just an advise, don't worry if you don't mind
[neutral]	[07:31]	<antidrugue>	abtinf: perhaps you can try the alternate CD
[neutral]	[07:31]	<joeamined>	please can you help ???
[negative]	[07:31]	<naknomik>	I am trying ekiga. Can a windows user talk to me over Ekiga? Is Ekiga or other Windows application available for Ekiga?
[negative]	[07:31]	<abtinf>	antidrugue: you mean install from the alt-cd?
[positive]	[07:31]	<grayman>	abtinf, you can disable splash by editing the entry in grub
[neutral]	[07:32]	<wireless_trouble>	Is there a tool in the ubuntu which shows all availeble wirless networks
[positive]	[07:32]	<Dante123>	I may get around to using WAP......but at the time I was setting things up......WEP was only option with my particular adapter and linux.......now that has changed..........however......to the best of my knowledge......WEP has kept innocent people out......
[positive]	[07:32]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: GRUB is very powerful and lets you change boot configuration withouth changing configuration files. Thus, you can test boot configs withouth having to reboot to the live CD, edit the file and reboot.
[negative]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: i have no idea what you're doing sorry. you haven't given any information or responded to what i was asking.
[neutral]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	abting: yaya
[positive]	[07:32]	<abtinf>	grayman: ok, i'll check it out
[neutral]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	am i invisible ??
[neutral]	[07:32]	<Faolchu>	Anyone? =(
[negative]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	no one wants to help ??
[neutral]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: yes invisible mode
[neutral]	[07:32]	<andi5>	!networkmanager > wireless_trouble
[negative]	[07:32]	<grayman>	abo, i assume that the system is installed
[negative]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: as i said earlier, i don't know what your problem is, you're not giving any information. first you said you can't get into X, that libnewt was missing, that you have an IO error trying to isntall it, that you moved it manually, that the file is now corrupted and now your system is corrupted.
[negative]	[07:32]	<ffm>	joeamined: Yes, I cannot see you.
[negative]	[07:32]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: what was your question again?
[negative]	[07:32]	<grayman>	abtinf, i assume that the system is installed
[neutral]	[07:32]	<abo>	grayman, pardon?
[negative]	[07:32]	<delire>	neilther1: frankly i have no idea what you're upto there.
[neutral]	[07:32]	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
[neutral]	[07:33]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: if you think that it could be solved by changing hd to sd, then reboot and, once in GRUB, press 'e', and edit the configuration. Is very straighforward.
[positive]	[07:33]	<grayman>	abo, wrong person :)
[neutral]	[07:33]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i will do?xd
[positive]	[07:33]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, try one of the cracking programs and youll see how terribly easy is to fool a wep wifi.
[positive]	[07:33]	<Jabop>	Hi, what is a good tool to record a desktop?
[negative]	[07:33]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: i already answered: are you use the CD is fine? are you installing from the live CD or alternate CD ?
[neutral]	[07:33]	<abo>	grayman, no prob
[neutral]	[07:33]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, so, i will change hd for sd, and if it doesnt work i will back to the livecd and edit it to hd agian
[neutral]	[07:33]	<omaar>	joeamined: maybe the system is not yet completely translated to french
[negative]	[07:33]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: that's exactly what you shouldn't do, its too much time.,
[positive]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, aff XD
[neutral]	[07:34]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you trying to install in french ?
[negative]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i can do then?
[negative]	[07:34]	<Dante123>	"i'm not into hacking....but I believe you Artemis3.....its just that until now...it has been a low priority to change....and I figured WEP at least kept some ""innocent users"" from hitching a ride on my wifi......at some point I should ""upgrade"" my security...."
[negative]	[07:34]	<bliz0r>	Anyone got experience with akamaru? I got problems with dragging launchers to the bar/removing them
[neutral]	[07:34]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can reboot, and once in GRUB, press 'e' and edit the boot configuration.
[negative]	[07:34]	<CheesyJedi>	"how do I edit the settings for ubuntu's new ""desktop effects""?"
[neutral]	[07:34]	<joeamined>	antidrugue, yes
[negative]	[07:34]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: there you can test without loosing much time.
[negative]	[07:34]	<colbert>	How do I completely remove a package?
[negative]	[07:34]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ok ok
[negative]	[07:34]	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
[negative]	[07:35]	<antidrugue>	bliz0r: yes it doesn't work very well, you are better off editing the file populate-dock.sh and rerun it
[neutral]	[07:35]	<joeamined>	i'm using the live cd
[neutral]	[07:35]	<delire>	colbert: sudo dpkg -P packagename
[positive]	[07:35]	<chrispche>	Hello can anyone help me. I've been using Gnome on Ubuntu for 3 months and have just installed KDE. But it is at a higher resolution. How do you change the res?
[positive]	[07:35]	<chrispche>	Thanks.
[neutral]	[07:35]	<andi5>	colbert: --purge it
[negative]	[07:35]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, it is a very bad surprise, wep gives a false sense of security, it should be removed...
[neutral]	[07:35]	<antidrugue>	joeamined: i haven't try the installation in french unfortunately
[negative]	[07:35]	<delire>	colbert: or, sudo apt-get remove packagename --purge
[neutral]	[07:35]	<Dante123>	"netgear can be bastards....they give one name and number to cards with up to three different chipsents etc.   like russian roulette....you hope you didn't get the ""bad"" one....."
[neutral]	[07:35]	<antidrugue>	perhaps you can try #ubuntu-fr
[neutral]	[07:35]	<antidrugue>	!fr
[neutral]	[07:35]	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[negative]	[07:35]	<ffm>	Artemis3: But what about legacy devices that support WEP only?
[negative]	[07:35]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: meanwhile, I'll search for some documentation ok?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<omaar>	joeamined: ubuntu is not yet completely translated to french
[neutral]	[07:35]	<^marcus^>	anyone have some info on how to get side buttons on mice working.. like thumb buttons on mx518 for example.. in ubuntu 7.04
[negative]	[07:35]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ok
[neutral]	[07:36]	<Aiwuu>	debaser, brb
[positive]	[07:36]	<colbert>	delire: thanks !
[neutral]	[07:36]	<delire>	colbert: np
[positive]	[07:36]	<Artemis3>	ffm, yeah, thats a problem... maybe use them for public wifi only? ;)
[negative]	[07:36]	<ffm>	hod do i COMPLETLY DISABLE root login except by sudo?
[positive]	[07:36]	<Dante123>	ffm.....exactly what my issue was when I first setup my wifi.......Artemis3 must have all brand new and shiny HW......while we plebians have to deal with legacy stuff...... ;-)
[negative]	[07:36]	<kkathman>	Is there any other chat client for gnome besides X-Chat ?
[neutral]	[07:36]	<antidrugue>	ffm: it is disabled by default
[positive]	[07:36]	<surviver>	^marcus^, if u know that you help me 2 alot :p i have mx518 but they said logitech didnt make any drivers for linux...
[positive]	[07:36]	<ffm>	Artemis3: Well, my DS only works with WEB
[neutral]	[07:36]	<delire>	ffm: you shouldn't have a root login
[neutral]	[07:36]	<xeshm>	D:

[neutral]	[07:36]	<xeshm>	help
[neutral]	[07:36]	<ffm>	Artemis3: WEP
[negative]	[07:37]	<sebrock>	no hint on how to create a mouseclick with a script?
[negative]	[07:37]	<andi5>	ffm: are you able to login as root somewhere?
[negative]	[07:37]	<Dante123>	So are you using WEP...Artemis3?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<xeshm>	sudo su?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<omaar>	joeamined: vous pouvez poser votre question l-bas: #ubuntu-fr
[neutral]	[07:37]	<ffm>	antidrugue: But my RKCHECKER says it is.
[negative]	[07:37]	<ffm>	andi5: antidrugue:    Checking for allowed root login... Watch out Root login possible. Possible risk!
[neutral]	[07:37]	<delire>	sebrock: you could probably jack into the gnome input events stream somehow.
[positive]	[07:37]	<Artemis3>	Dante123, no, i simply read how the wep exploit works, its sad; worse than css ;)
[negative]	[07:37]	<andi5>	ffm: sounds like sshd configuration?
[negative]	[07:37]	<xeshm>	ubuntu does not recognice speedstep in my lap D:
[neutral]	[07:37]	<ffm>	"antidrugue:  andi5:     info: ""PermitRootLogin yes"" found in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config"

[neutral]	[07:37]	<delire>	sebrock: simulate it using SDL for a project using SDL (like games). depends on the API.
[negative]	[07:37]	<Dante123>	So you run no security at all?
[neutral]	[07:38]	<antidrugue>	ffm: try to log as root, and see for yourself
[neutral]	[07:38]	<antidrugue>	"ffm: ""su"""
[negative]	[07:38]	<ramirand>	Hi all. I'm switching from Mandriva to 7.04 - I currently run a small website, as well as use it for a desktop. Is it better to start with server and add the desktop packages, or start with desktop and add the web stuff?
[neutral]	[07:38]	<antidrugue>	you won't be able too, the password is unset by default
[negative]	[07:38]	<taggie>	Artemis3, wide open wifi is fine, as long as it's firewalled from your wired network, it adds a certain amount of plausible deniability in case of bad things happening on(or from) your network.
[negative]	[07:38]	<sebrock>	SDL, your going overkill here, Im just wanna create one click on the desktop upon boot

[negative]	[07:39]	<Artemis3>	simply put, if you use wep, anyone can join your wifi, just remember that. Maybe filter with mac address or something.

[negative]	[07:39]	<xeshm>	hi, i need help my lap is over heating on feisty cant use the speedstep thing fr cpu the cpu meter says its not supported but 3 days ago was ok
[positive]	[07:39]	<delire>	wireless_trouble: you should purge network manager and just use the normal gnome network tools.
[neutral]	[07:39]	<mirak>	Artemis3: apt-get install spoofmac
[neutral]	[07:39]	<Dante123>	Anyone that know how to.......and that eliminates a good 98% of my neighbourhood.....maybe even more....
[negative]	[07:39]	<triceratops>	Any hint how files in /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-lowlatency/volatile/ are created (esp. fglrx.ko). Due to dpkg-query they don't belong to a package.

[negative]	[07:40]	<wireless_trouble>	delire how can i start them .. I am new to linux
[negative]	[07:40]	<mikere>	ramirand: I would generally say start with server and then add - since that ends up with the least amount of extra stuff installed.  Probably won't make all that much difference in the end but can avoid having some vulnerable desktop apps installed on a server.  Maybe....
[neutral]	[07:40]	<ramirand>	mikere: Thx.

[positive]	[07:40]	<delire>	wireless_trouble: this is a known problem with realtek cards: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:40]	<Dante123>	so my argmument is not that WEP is so good.....I'm sure your hack info is right....just that it is better than leaving it wide open.....
[negative]	[07:40]	<mirak>	andi5: hum that's not the good name, but there is mac spoofer, I already used it
[negative]	[07:40]	<antidrugue>	things are going to fast here
[negative]	[07:40]	<igge>	surviver: how can I make that happen automatically?
[negative]	[07:40]	<Dante123>	Certainly there are better alternatives.....though....so your point is well taken.
[neutral]	[07:40]	<xeshm>	hello?
[neutral]	[07:40]	<xeshm>	pls
[neutral]	[07:40]	<abtinf>	grayman: i disabled the splash in grub and the boot worked flawlessly. Do you have any suggestion for how I can figure out while the splash screen is on, so that I can submit a bug report?
[positive]	[07:40]	<wireless_trouble>	delire . thanks I will have a look there
[positive]	[07:41]	<Selenolycus>	I need some help. I selected the Human List login theme, as well as enabled Remote Login - and now X keeps crashing at startup.

[neutral]	[07:41]	<ffm>	Dante123: But, it provides newbies w/ false sence of security
[positive]	[07:41]	<ramirand>	Dante123: I've had WEP on for years... no hacks that I can report. But then again, my neighbor operates wide open -- who'd bother hacking me? :)
[negative]	[07:41]	<mikere>	Dante123: you are correct - even broken WEP is better than nothing at all
[negative]	[07:41]	<grayman>	abtinf, you say that it stops at 1/3 of the way?
[neutral]	[07:41]	<abtinf>	grayman: yes
[negative]	[07:41]	<bongo_boy>	ummm hi guys... does anyone how to fix the 3D cube desktop effect thing? It worked once, but never again - I have a mobility ATI 9600, using the Xorg driver...
[negative]	[07:41]	<delire>	wireless_trouble: this should sort it out. gnome's network-admin can be found in system->preferences i think.
[neutral]	[07:41]	<ffm>	kemik: Yes.
[positive]	[07:41]	<taggie>	Dante123; i'd say wide-open is fine. you shouldn't be using cleartext protocols, and you shouldn't bridge directly to your private network, but sharing is nice :)
[neutral]	[07:41]	<ffm>	kemik: Sudo apt-get install ddd

[negative]	[07:45]	<Kazol>	What is the normal idle load average? I'm getting ~0.5 with all applets and widgets running on a 500Mhz. CPU.
[neutral]	[07:45]	<debaser>	Aiwuu: I'm happy for u.
[negative]	[07:45]	<delire>	nameless`: perhaps see #vnc if it exists..
[positive]	[07:45]	<surviver>	igge, i know it is possible maybe somewhere in fstab?
[negative]	[07:45]	<nameless`>	nobody in vnc :(
[negative]	[07:45]	<surviver>	igge, yes thats possible
[negative]	[07:45]	<Selenolycus>	installing kdm seems to have fixed it.
[positive]	[07:45]	<Selenolycus>	thanks all the help guys
[negative]	[07:45]	<delire>	Crav: AFAIK thunderbird stores mail in the mbox format, so you can just import it into whatever client you're using in Linux.
[negative]	[07:45]	<taggie>	"Kazol, there really isn't a ""normal"" idle load average. That said, .5 is low enough you shouldn't be waiting on much."
[neutral]	[07:46]	<nameless`>	delire i followed that howto on the ubuntu webby but i keep walking in that error :s
[negative]	[07:46]	<FrankX>	i use a headless box and VNCserver to view the desktop but can only get 800x600 resolution, how do i increase this to 1024x768 or 1280x1024?
[neutral]	[07:46]	<Lcarsdata>	1kl
[negative]	[07:46]	<andi5>	Crav: you might be able to copy your whole profile directory

[negative]	[07:46]	<delire>	nameless`: i don't know anything about VNC. i'm really a Linux only guy.
[neutral]	[07:46]	<nameless`>	FRanKo edit the xvnc config file
[positive]	[07:46]	<ffm>	does folding@home negitably affect machine performance?
[negative]	[07:46]	<larson999>	i share the same thunderbird dir for windows and linux.  was just a matter of telling windows which profile to use.
[negative]	[07:46]	<igge>	surviver: but it doesn't get mounted through fstab... it gets mounted by some newer mechanism which I'm not sure how it works
[neutral]	[07:46]	<surviver>	igge, u can open fstab with root edit the usb drive set it to ro and done
[neutral]	[07:46]	<delire>	nameless`: a little OS X (though regretfully)
[negative]	[07:46]	<Crav>	andi5: i can't seem to find where thunderbird is saving my mail (in ubuntu)
[negative]	[07:47]	<RobbieCrash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
[negative]	[07:47]	<nameless`>	delire i'm not even a linux guy <o> i'm already quite happy everything was running till i wanted a lil more hehe
[neutral]	[07:47]	<antidrugue>	Frank: the resolution is defined on the server side, so make sure you start your VNC server with the correct resolution
[neutral]	[07:47]	<debaser>	J^zon: do you have a router? how are you connecting both computers?
[positive]	[07:47]	<surviver>	igge, mzz quiet odd cause i've got here my usb drive and i set it in fstab to read only save it and it works ...
[negative]	[07:47]	<igge>	surviver: i mean if I insert a usb stick (or camera or whatever) it gets mounted, but not using fstab
[neutral]	[07:47]	<delire>	nameless`: hehe you glutton!
[positive]	[07:47]	<Shaffox>	in what language are the apps in linux here written ? for example xchat or network manager or whatver
[neutral]	[07:47]	<ffm>	RobbieCrash: Sure your ports are forwarded correctly?
[neutral]	[07:47]	<J^zon>	I have a router
[neutral]	[07:47]	<surviver>	igge, mzz oke
[positive]	[07:47]	<taggie>	Kazol, if you have speed issues, and are running standard ubuntu, you may want to try xfce instead of gnome. you can install with: sudo apt-get install xubuntu and then you'll be able to switch back and forth between both. xfce tends to be nicer to slow procs.
[negative]	[07:47]	<andi5>	Crav: you may need to show hidden files.... it is either in ~/.thunderbird or ~/.mozilla/thunderbird (sorry, i am using evolution)

[neutral]	[07:52]	<delire>	sorcerer: to search for a package first: apt-cache search keyword
[neutral]	[07:52]	<debaser>	madman91: you must set the correct privileges. If I'm not wrong, check system > administration
[negative]	[07:52]	<debaser>	madman91: there must be something there

[negative]	[07:53]	<sorcerer>	delire:  i did a apt-cache search vlc and it spat out alot of stroings or lines you guys call it
[neutral]	[07:53]	<J^zon>	no
[negative]	[07:53]	<andi5>	madman91: you can check what groups these users belong to with `id myusername' ... there should be a difference, you can then use `adduser myname mygroup' (or use the gui somehow) ... maybe group 'admin'?
[negative]	[07:53]	<teethdood>	I want to uninstall certain apps like wvdial (PPP dialer) which I'll never use. Why is it telling me ubuntu-desktop needs it?
[neutral]	[07:53]	<madman91>	debaser: i dont know what to look for...
[neutral]	[07:53]	<J^zon>	Debaser: no
[neutral]	[07:53]	<debaser>	madman91: well, technically they are not privileges, they are groups

[negative]	[07:53]	<sorcerer>	delire: so does this mean vlc is available .. or what other info does it give like .. other repos i need to install ?
[neutral]	[07:54]	<debaser>	madman91: look for a user administration program.
[neutral]	[07:54]	<klo8>	i've got a problem when performing apt-get update; bzip2 returns with an error: @HLINK

[positive]	[07:54]	<Stig>	Hi all. Is there a program or any way to help configure my battery on my laptop? I am new to Ubuntu and have noticed my battery does not last as long as it did on XP. Any idea's why?
[positive]	[07:54]	<antidrugue>	teethdood: ubuntu-desktop is big meta packages on which depends most of the components of your system, it is mostly present for upgrade purpose
[negative]	[07:54]	<trol0s>	I'm going mad.. how do I disable touchpad tap-to-click :S
[negative]	[07:54]	<KrakensDen>	this is on a laptop, so it's fairly annoying
[negative]	[07:54]	<wireless_trouble>	delire -> i cleaned the network intefces file and rebooted. In the network diagnose I do see, that packts are going out and comming in ... but i am not sure if the ip works ... it seems to run under ip6 ... and I am not aware my router can handle this ...

[negative]	[07:55]	<Zenerek>	hello, I have been trying to install ubuntu on a machine with a promise fastrak tx2000, i had been told before here to look for a certain driver in the live cd and i found it, the problem is that the raid is not working right it looks at two individual disks instead of the combined total you're supposed to get in raid, i did some checking with the lspci command and  saw the fasttrak listed but it's subsystem was listed as unknown
[positive]	[07:55]	<KrakensDen>	 pci=ro quiet splash  <- end of my kernel line

[negative]	[07:55]	<rellik>	anyone know of a good system monitoring program?  something like monit (but that will use a mail server with TLS)
[negative]	[07:55]	<andi5>	madman91: maybe 'adm' then
[negative]	[07:55]	<sharperguy>	ok wtfreck just happened?
[negative]	[07:55]	<debaser>	J^zon: that's the IP of the computer with ubuntu, the one you are using.
[neutral]	[07:56]	<madman91>	andi5: ?
[negative]	[07:56]	<Stig>	kemik: How do I enable energy saving options? and can I possibly set different profiles that I can switch to when using battery power? It would be quite annoying having to change the settings everytime I switch to battery power.
[negative]	[07:56]	<sharperguy>	nautilus died, then gnome toolbar, and no report from ubuntu just weird stuff happening

[negative]	[07:56]	<sorcerer>	delire: mate i do have real player why does it error out for me
[negative]	[07:56]	<debaser>	madman91: I'm not sitting in an Ubuntu machine, so I can precissely tell you what groups they are or how is the program named, but there must be something in system > administration
[neutral]	[07:56]	<safrus>	ubuntu does not detect the OS on reboot after install
[neutral]	[07:56]	<madman91>	debaser: regarding priveleges?

[negative]	[07:57]	<madman91>	debaser: i have to look at group permissions to solve my suspend problem?
[negative]	[07:57]	<taggie>	Zenerek, you should get into the bios menu of the FastTrak and setup your raid volume there.

[neutral]	[07:59]	<Delco2>	he debaser
[negative]	[07:59]	<taggie>	Zenerek, if the OS sees two disks separately, then the raid isn't setup correctly. the card should only be reporting a single target
[negative]	[07:59]	<debaser>	Delco2: yep?
[neutral]	[07:59]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, when I boot up, I get no usplash

[negative]	[08:00]	<KrakensDen>	bebaser, I do get a prompt for entering my root password for 'maintenance'
[neutral]	[08:00]	<debaser>	it could help

[negative]	[08:00]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: how much ram do you have?
[neutral]	[08:01]	<debaser>	KrakenDens: try to select the correct entrance
[negative]	[08:01]	<rmd_>	Delco2, why are you trying to boot such an old version and how much ram are you working with/
[neutral]	[08:01]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, the default is 3
[neutral]	[08:01]	<Crav>	!perl
[negative]	[08:01]	<safrus>	can someone please look at my problem here @HLINK and help me get ubuntu to boot up.
[neutral]	[08:01]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, the third kernel is the generic kernel, not the generic recovery mode kernel
[negative]	[08:01]	<sorcerer>	coudl any one tell me iam in edy .. should i upgrade and is it .. unstable or buggy the new ubuntu
[negative]	[08:01]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about perl - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[08:01]	<Stig>	trol0s: How do I open gnome-power-manager? I press alt+F2 and type it in their, but nothing happeneds.
[negative]	[08:01]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, or does it count from zero?
[neutral]	[08:01]	<Delco2>	why: because its what I have available atm. 256K of memory available.
[negative]	[08:01]	<ed12>	antidrugue - thx.. that's what I had thought... But that was a long time ago.. I was thinking things have changed.
[negative]	[08:01]	<debaser>	KrakenDens: there should be a message before the password ask
[negative]	[08:01]	<Zenerek>	taggie just to see if it was the card or not i used my windows 2000 disk and the floppy with the promise drivers, it saw one single mass not two drives
[negative]	[08:02]	<Crav>	how do i run a prgm in perl (in windows, i'm used to C:\perl\bin\perl PRGMNAME)
[positive]	[08:02]	<DShepherd>	sorcerer, i am upgraded and it seemed to work fine.. so i would recommend it
[positive]	[08:02]	<taggie>	Stig, System-> preferences-> Power settings
[negative]	[08:02]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, there isn't
[negative]	[08:02]	<debaser>	KrakenDens: it counts beginning from 0
[neutral]	[08:02]	<antidrugue>	ed12: yes, things are better, but i386 is still less trouble
[neutral]	[08:02]	<J^zon>	debaser: do YOU need the IP?
[negative]	[08:02]	<trol0s>	Stig: I have no idea.. I just saw it in the link you got
[neutral]	[08:02]	<debaser>	J^zon: you need it.
[positive]	[08:02]	<trol0s>	Alt+F2? nice.. learned something new..
[neutral]	[08:02]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, brb then
[neutral]	[08:02]	<surviver>	safrus, u controled ur /boot/grub/menu.lst file?
[neutral]	[08:02]	<Delco2>	rmd_, why: because its what I have available atm. 256K of memory available.
[neutral]	[08:02]	<ed12>	antidrugue - How much of a speed increase do you get by going to 64 bit...?   any rough estimate?  20% maybe??
[neutral]	[08:02]	<J^zon>	debaser: I got it.. what next?
[negative]	[08:02]	<debaser>	J^zon: go to the other computer and ping the computer you are using by running ping IP
[neutral]	[08:03]	<kiersie>	less i think
[neutral]	[08:03]	<safrus>	i posted the menu.lst at that link
[neutral]	[08:03]	<safrus>	but i didnt control it
[positive]	[08:03]	<DShepherd>	Crav, @HLINK -- google works
[negative]	[08:03]	<taggie>	Zenerek, that's odd. is it possible that you're seeing the correct one (with proper size), and another fake lun that's used for configuration?
[negative]	[08:03]	<naknomik>	how do i play a vcd on ubuntu?
[negative]	[08:03]	<safrus>	i just let ubuntu install itself
[negative]	[08:03]	<antidrugue>	ed12: certainly less than 10%, maybe less, nothing worth the trouble
[negative]	[08:03]	<Stig>	taggie, thanks, I have already looked in there but it hasn't got any options to change CPU power, GFX power, etc. I have a 2Ghz dual core processor, and on Windows I was able to use only half of the CPU, which saved alot of battery power.
[negative]	[08:03]	<debaser>	J^zon: the other computer is running windows or linux?
[negative]	[08:03]	<antidrugue>	ed12: use a custom kernel if you want real speed improvements
[neutral]	[08:03]	<J^zon>	debaser: the other puter is running windows
[negative]	[08:03]	<sorcerer>	DShepherd: i mean is it known to be buggy
[neutral]	[08:03]	<DShepherd>	sorcerer, i dont think so..
[positive]	[08:03]	<debaser>	J^zon: xp?
[negative]	[08:03]	<taggie>	stig, there's a gnome widget that lets you choose CPU throttling settings. let me see where it's at...
[neutral]	[08:04]	<antidrugue>	Stif: yes, you can do that in Linux too
[positive]	[08:04]	<J^zon>	debaser: the other puter is running windows XP
[neutral]	[08:04]	<ed12>	antidrugue - .. d/ling the 32bit fiesty now... thx...
[negative]	[08:04]	<antidrugue>	Stig: did you read the tutorial i linked?
[negative]	[08:04]	<antidrugue>	ed12: ok cool
[negative]	[08:04]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: w/ less than 192MB ram, the livecd doesnt boot, but that obviously isnt your problem.  Have you tried booting into safe graphics mode?
[positive]	[08:04]	<Stig>	antidrugue, yes, I'm reading it now thanks :)
[negative]	[08:04]	<antidrugue>	Stig: ok
[neutral]	[08:04]	<surviver>	safrus, mzz looks fine
[negative]	[08:04]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes I have tried safe graph mode.
[positive]	[08:04]	<antidrugue>	Stig: there is a part about CPU power management
[negative]	[08:04]	<stellaras>	"hi there, i have ubuntu 7.04 installed but i can't save,delete etc.. my external usb (i can see and use files but won't let me do anything) also i can see a partition with the name ""Filesystem""(In Places-> Computer) which i think that is the partition that ubuntu is installed i want to save files there is it possible? it also don't let me"
[negative]	[08:04]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: what video card do you have
[negative]	[08:05]	<debaser>	J^zon: in the other computer go to Start > Execute and type cmd
[negative]	[08:05]	<DShepherd>	naknomik, what player are you using?
[positive]	[08:05]	<Stig>	yeah I just clicked on the tutorial :)
[positive]	[08:05]	<debaser>	J^zon: inside the command line type ping IP
[neutral]	[08:05]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, its an onboard Intel
[negative]	[08:05]	<taggie>	"Stig; right click on your panel at top, click ""at to panel"" in the resulting dialog box, find the entry listed ""CPU Frequency scaling monitor"" it will tell you how the cpu is running, and let you set how you want it used (high power, as needed, low power, etc.)"
[neutral]	[08:05]	<kiersie>	try format it to fat32
[negative]	[08:05]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: ok well first select the option to check disk for errors
[negative]	[08:05]	<naknomik>	DShepherd:  what do you mean? I just have a regular computer with CD driver.
[neutral]	[08:05]	<stellaras>	kiersie: was the answer for me?
[negative]	[08:05]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes i've tried that and it freezes.
[negative]	[08:06]	<DShepherd>	naknomik, have you tried to play the VCD?
[neutral]	[08:06]	<J^zon>	debaser: that worked
[neutral]	[08:06]	<kiersie>	stellaras
[negative]	[08:06]	<safrus>	whenever i reboot it straight doesn't detect ubuntu at all
[neutral]	[08:06]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: if there are no errors, try 6.10 or 7.04 and see if that livecd works.  if not, download the alternate cd which is a text  based installer.
[negative]	[08:06]	<trol0s>	antidrugue: do you know why these sort of things aren't integrated in the power management menu already..?
[negative]	[08:06]	<debaser>	now type ipconfig in the command line
[neutral]	[08:06]	<surviver>	safrus, u have installed grub? when u boot u see the grub menu?
[neutral]	[08:06]	<Stig>	taggie, oh nice! thanks
[negative]	[08:06]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: oh well if you try the check disk and it freezes then your burn is messed up
[neutral]	[08:06]	<safrus>	i dont see grub
[negative]	[08:06]	<alrex021>	i try to install the ubuntu 7.04 on my PS3, but it stops on 15% every time. Could anyone pls shed some light my direction.
[neutral]	[08:06]	<taggie>	Stig; no problem
[positive]	[08:06]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: for most people it works out of the box
[positive]	[08:06]	<stellaras>	kiersie: but i have all of my works in the external
[negative]	[08:06]	<stellaras>	i can't format it
[neutral]	[08:06]	<grogoreo>	hi
[negative]	[08:06]	<Zenerek>	taggie: i'm not sure what you mean but there are no other drives seen only the two seagates, i turned of the primary ide channel that had a fat 32 drive on it, anyway i tried both oem and graphical mode, have not tried text, oh and i'm on dapper here
[negative]	[08:06]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
[negative]	[08:06]	<debaser>	"J^zon:  it worked by saying repeteadly ""64 bytes from...""?"
[negative]	[08:07]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: You need to do an md5sum on your downloaded iso and see if it matches the md5sum on ubuntu's website. if they dont match, your download failed. if they do match, just reburn the cd and try again
[neutral]	[08:07]	<Flannel>	alrex021: did you verify the cd?
[negative]	[08:07]	<safrus>	i dont see anything when i boot, just a message saying no OS was detected
[positive]	[08:07]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... ahhhhh. that may be it. one moment. will try that again.
[neutral]	[08:07]	<surviver>	safrus, mzz thats quiet a prob cause the grub let u chose what u boot up so u didnt install it or its buggy
[neutral]	[08:07]	<J^zon>	debaser: repeatedly... four times
[negative]	[08:07]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: the things I mentioned here: @HLINK  are really just details
[neutral]	[08:07]	<debaser>	J^zon: good
[negative]	[08:07]	<alrex021>	Flannel: yes I did verify
[negative]	[08:07]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
[negative]	[08:07]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i would try the supergrubdisk, and manually install grub, and point it at Ubuntu.
[neutral]	[08:07]	<J^zon>	debaser: next?
[neutral]	[08:07]	<sam__>	hey
[negative]	[08:07]	<grogoreo>	I've just backed up my /var/log folder and doing du -hs on the folder says it's 24M but when I tar it with bz2 it goes down to 5.9M. Is this right? It seems a lot lower than I thought
[neutral]	[08:07]	<sam__>	anyone know how to chagne the port for the apache server
[neutral]	[08:07]	<debaser>	J^zon: now do the same but inversely. ping the win computer from the ubuntu computer, with the same command but the correct ip
[neutral]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i have it set on port 80
[neutral]	[08:08]	<sam__>	but...
[negative]	[08:08]	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
[neutral]	[08:08]	<sam__>	it aint workin
[neutral]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i need to set it to port 81
[negative]	[08:08]	<debaser>	J^zon: to know the ip of the win computer use 'ipconfig' in the command line
[negative]	[08:08]	<kiersie>	Hum ok ntfs is that inside 7.04
[neutral]	[08:08]	<sam__>	i opened the port on my router firewall
[neutral]	[08:08]	<safrus>	hmmmm
[negative]	[08:08]	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid adapter shouldn't be presenting anything other than the logical volumes you've told it to. the OS shouldn't magically have access to the disks directly. if it does, i don't know what to suggest.
[negative]	[08:08]	<alrex021>	Flannel: its asks about some NewWorld partition
[positive]	[08:08]	<trol0s>	antidrugue: thanks, the Add To Panel thing taggie mention was something incredible I didn't know so that'll sort it out :)
[negative]	[08:08]	<sam__>	but how do i change the apache server so it runs off that port....
[negative]	[08:08]	<surviver>	safrus, u remember when u installed u saw in the overview what u was going to install the grub stand in it? normally its easy to see u got then a choice where u want to install grub
[negative]	[08:08]	<J^zon>	debaser: ok.. brb
[negative]	[08:08]	<xange>	how do I mount my hfs+ external usb drive?
[negative]	[08:09]	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
[neutral]	[08:09]	<grogoreo>	sam__:  look in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and in your virtual machine file in /etc/apache2/sites-available
[negative]	[08:09]	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up?????????????/
[negative]	[08:09]	<sam__>	ok in the conf
[neutral]	[08:09]	<sam__>	wht do i change
[negative]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: what does brb means?
[positive]	[08:09]	<Flannel>	sam__: it's in sites-available, theres some ports at the top
[positive]	[08:09]	<safrus>	it gives you an option to pick by clicking advanced
[neutral]	[08:09]	<sam__>	change it to 81
[neutral]	[08:09]	<kiersie>	hummm....
[neutral]	[08:09]	<surviver>	debaser, be right back
[neutral]	[08:09]	<IndyGunFreak>	debaser: be right back.
[negative]	[08:09]	<safrus>	first try i didn't touch it
[neutral]	[08:09]	<sam__>	site avalibe port
[neutral]	[08:09]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: in some distro the CPU frequency monitor applet is there by default (like in Fedora)
[negative]	[08:09]	<Jack313>	How do i get to system>preferences>sessions???????/
[neutral]	[08:09]	<tatters>	/jon #mythtv-users
[negative]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: anyway, if it worked we're one step closer
[negative]	[08:09]	<safrus>	2nd i tried sdb2 and then i got a message saying grub failed to install
[positive]	[08:09]	<Flannel>	sam__: also, you'll need to add those ports to ports.conf
[negative]	[08:09]	<debaser>	J^zon: are you trying to use samba?
[neutral]	[08:09]	<Kazol>	Where do I get Konversation themes?
[negative]	[08:10]	<taggie>	Stig and trol0s; one thing you should know about that widget on laptops, when i resume from suspend, it seems to lock my cpu into full throttle mode until i restart X, i've reported it as a bug, and i don't know if it happens for other people, just something to watch.
[neutral]	[08:10]	<antidrugue>	trol0s: but still CPU frequency management is enabled by default in Ubuntu (for most people), it is just the applet that isn't there by default
[negative]	[08:10]	<sam__>	where is that??
[neutral]	[08:10]	<sam__>	ports.conf
[neutral]	[08:10]	<surviver>	safrus maybe try to install it and try to set the grub at some place else then maybe it works cause ur os is installed only the grub wont work
[negative]	[08:10]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: usually the Live CD, jsut installs Grub, it doesn't give you a choice where to install it.
[negative]	[08:10]	<sam__>	where is ports .conf
[neutral]	[08:10]	<Flannel>	sam__: in /etc/apache2
[negative]	[08:10]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you booting off two hard drives.
[positive]	[08:10]	<Shacker6363>	Hrmm, can anyone in here recommend me a good uTorrent alternative besides Azureus that is Gnome native?
[positive]	[08:10]	<debaser>	surviver: thanks
[negative]	[08:10]	<J^zon>	debaser: I don't think so.. what is samba?
[negative]	[08:10]	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, over here i had i could choce between 2 or 3 palces
[negative]	[08:10]	<teethdood>	"AmaroK is saying ""No MP3 support"" what do I do?"
[positive]	[08:10]	<Woody_>	hi people, what is the command line to get Picasa?

[neutral]	[08:10]	<sam__>	which files do i change
[negative]	[08:10]	<safrus>	i have 2 hard drives
[neutral]	[08:10]	<sam__>	again
[negative]	[08:10]	<Zenerek>	taggie: so you're saying that the raid card should in fact be seeing a whole mass and not two drives, well in gparted i see to disks, so i guess i'm screwed
[neutral]	[08:10]	<sam__>	ports.conf
[neutral]	[08:10]	<debaser>	!samba > J^zon
[neutral]	[08:10]	<sam__>	wht else>??
[neutral]	[08:10]	<Flannel>	sam__: all apache2 config stuff will be in /etc/apache2/conf

[negative]	[08:10]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i don't know, last 3x I've installed Ubuntu, it just installed automatically, w/o giving a choice
[neutral]	[08:11]	<antidrugue>	!mp3

[neutral]	[08:11]	<debaser>	J^zon: are you trying to share files?
[negative]	[08:11]	<GionnyBoss>	Shacker6363: deluge is gnome native. Personally, I prefere azureus, but just give deluge a try!
[positive]	[08:11]	<KrakensDen>	debaser, thank you, that was definitely a PEBKAC issue
[negative]	[08:11]	<safrus>	then other drive is just media storage
[negative]	[08:11]	<Flannel>	sam__: ports.conf and then your virtualhost, in sites-available
[negative]	[08:11]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried changing the boot sequence in your bios?
[neutral]	[08:11]	<antidrugue>	!mp3 > teethdood
[positive]	[08:11]	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. i would like to share files
[negative]	[08:11]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
[positive]	[08:11]	<debaser>	KrakensDen: great!
[positive]	[08:11]	<safrus>	i checked the boot sequence and it showed my sata drive being first still
[negative]	[08:11]	<debaser>	J^zon: do you know now what samba is?
[negative]	[08:11]	<sam__>	ok it says listen on port 81
[neutral]	[08:11]	<sam__>	so ...
[negative]	[08:11]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats not what i meant
[negative]	[08:11]	<Kazol>	Konversation is slowing down my whole computer. How can I reduce its resource usage?
[neutral]	[08:11]	<sam__>	it should now...
[positive]	[08:11]	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. thank you
[negative]	[08:11]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, try to install with u choice partitions option maybe u can set a partition for grub
[neutral]	[08:11]	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
[neutral]	[08:12]	<sam__>	if itype in my ip adress then:91
[neutral]	[08:12]	<sam__>	:81
[neutral]	[08:12]	<sam__>	it should work??
[positive]	[08:12]	<Shacker6363>	thanks GionnyBoss
[negative]	[08:12]	<Flannel>	sam__: please stop using the enter key as punctuation
[positive]	[08:12]	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid card should see both disks, like, when your computer first does power on self test, it should display a message offering to let you configure the promise card. in that menu, you should see both disks and be able to setup a logical volume. once linux boots, you should only see that volume, not the disks behind the volume.
[negative]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried CHANGING your boot sequence, to boot the other drive first...to see if grub was put on the other drive.
[neutral]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up samba in the ubuntu machine?
[positive]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: ur welcome
[neutral]	[08:12]	<J^zon>	Debaser: no I haven,t
[positive]	[08:12]	<Flannel>	sam__: you need to restart apache, `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart` for those changes to go into effect
[negative]	[08:12]	<Stig>	taggie, on the CPU frequency monitor. Is it possible to change the CPU power settings? I can only see it tell me what speed it is running at, but can;t see how to change it;s power settings, etc.
[neutral]	[08:12]	<safrus>	 no i havent
[neutral]	[08:12]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, still here?
[neutral]	[08:12]	<safrus>	the other drive is ntfs though
[negative]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: be a good thing to try, i8'm guessing its on the other drive.
[negative]	[08:12]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: it doesn't matter
[negative]	[08:12]	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up the windows machine? (which doesn't need samba)
[negative]	[08:13]	<Kazol>	Any ideas on reducing Konversation's resource usage and where to get themes?
[negative]	[08:13]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, he installed the os its on his machine only the grub is wrong placed or configured
[negative]	[08:13]	<taggie>	Stig, just click on it, it should have 4 entries: Conservative, Ondemand, Performance, Powersave
[negative]	[08:13]	<Stig>	taggie: Also, do you know if I need to have two instances of CPU frequency monitor running if I have a dual core processor?
[negative]	[08:13]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: yeah but im laggy
[neutral]	[08:13]	<delire>	Woody_: i think you have to download and install Picassa
[neutral]	[08:13]	<Delco2>	k
[negative]	[08:13]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i know that, but if he's booting the second hard drive first.. and grub isn't loading, its probably not there.
[negative]	[08:13]	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
[neutral]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
[neutral]	[08:13]	<IndyGunFreak>	so odds are, its on the other drive.
[negative]	[08:13]	<safrus>	how would i tell grub to install on the sata drive if i reinstall again?
[positive]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	thanks delire
[negative]	[08:13]	<taggie>	Stig, no the freq is the same between cores.
[neutral]	[08:13]	<delire>	Woody_: eg manually.. the way Windows and OS X users do.
[negative]	[08:13]	<J^zon>	debaser: i had set it up previously... when the other computer was running windows
[neutral]	[08:13]	<infidel>	i'm having trouble upgrading is there a way to boot of the cd and upgrade?
[positive]	[08:13]	<craigbass1976>	"Ok, I have efax set up with an external modem and it works fine.  How do I receive ""voice"" faxes.  These might not be any different than voicemails, but the lady I'm setting this up for has win95 and some fax program that accepts such voice faxes."
[negative]	[08:13]	<Woody_>	okay
[neutral]	[08:13]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: hmmm not sure about nomda
[positive]	[08:13]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, jup that can explain it he can also try to reinstall and set choice of grub to hd0
[negative]	[08:14]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: if i were you, i would reboot, and set whatever drive is set to boot second, to boot first, and see what hapens
[negative]	[08:14]	<J^zon>	debaser: i am attempting to migrate over
[neutral]	[08:14]	<|ringo|>	"Delco2: sure its not ""noDMA""?"
[negative]	[08:14]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: again, several ubuntu installs, and i've never been given a choice where to install grub.
[neutral]	[08:14]	<Stig>	"taggie, nothing happeneds when I left click, when I right click I see the normal taskbar options of ""preferences, help, about, remove from panel"" etc... :O"
[positive]	[08:14]	<debaser>	J^zon: good. There are several ways to setup samba, the faster is to edit config files.
[neutral]	[08:14]	<amro>	Middle mouse button won't work, but it worked fine under 6.10
[neutral]	[08:14]	<debaser>	J^zon: a good decision.
[neutral]	[08:14]	<infidel>	!upgrade
[neutral]	[08:14]	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[negative]	[08:14]	<markus_>	on edgy i had to run sox to make my intel hda soundcard capture line-in for watching tv. now with the feisty upgrade things just stopped working. no more sound in tv (btw: my iremote stopped working also)
[neutral]	[08:14]	<safrus>	when i look at the other drive shouldn't i see grub installed there?
[negative]	[08:14]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes. but its command line was nodma. probably the same thing
[negative]	[08:14]	<surviver>	IndygunFreak, lol strange i've got 2 choices :s
[negative]	[08:14]	<taggie>	Stig, no sure why, what kind of laptop/processor?
[positive]	[08:14]	<delire>	Woody_: you might want to take a look at f-spot. in many ways it's better than Picassa. sudo apt-get install f-spot
[negative]	[08:14]	<J^zon>	debaser: so.. what do i do next?
[negative]	[08:15]	<debaser>	J^zon: I can explain you how to configure samba with commandline, or you can look for a manual in internet. What do you prefer?
[negative]	[08:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no... listen.. restart your computer, go into your bios, and set your secondary drive, to boot first.... save changes and exit.
[negative]	[08:15]	<Woody_>	ah okay delire
[neutral]	[08:15]	<safrus>	hd0 or hd1?
[neutral]	[08:15]	<Stig>	Dell inspiron 9400, it's a intel T7200 Core 2 duo 2Ghz CPU I think...
[positive]	[08:15]	<Woody_>	thanks delire
[neutral]	[08:15]	<blanky>	!java
[neutral]	[08:15]	<ubotu>	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at @HLINK - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
[neutral]	[08:15]	<delire>	Woody_: @HLINK
[negative]	[08:15]	<craigbass1976>	The other thing I'm wondering is how come I set up dial up on a box and got an ip but no dns assignment?
[neutral]	[08:15]	<Stig>	taggie: Dell inspiron 9400, it's a intel T7200 Core 2 duo 2Ghz CPU I think...
[neutral]	[08:15]	<J^zon>	debaser: will the manual be clear?
[negative]	[08:15]	<scott_>	hey, can anyone point me to a feisty guide on manually installing the nvidia drivers through nvidia installer? since new beta drivers just came out and i want to try them
[neutral]	[08:15]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
[neutral]	[08:15]	<safrus>	indy i have to reinstall regardless cause i fubared the last install
[negative]	[08:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: well, i don't see how you did that, but ok, whatever you want to do, but i would see if grub is working first.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<danieltellez_>	hi!
[neutral]	[08:16]	<debaser>	J^zon: it will be surely more clear than me, and explained better.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: that way if there is a problem, we can address it now before you reinstall.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<debaser>	*clearer
[negative]	[08:16]	<taggie>	Stig, i don't know, it's possible there's no throttling support for the 7200 yet, but i don't know why that would be. what does the display say? 100% all the time?
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Stig>	It says it is running at 1Ghz in the CPU frequency monitor
[negative]	[08:16]	<safrus>	because i told grub to install to sdb2 which isn't a valid location apparantly
[neutral]	[08:16]	<taggie>	stig, that's odd.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Stig>	60%
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Stig>	50%
[neutral]	[08:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you using the alternate install cd, or the live CD?
[negative]	[08:16]	<J^zon>	debaser: I will try the manual... and ask you if i need help
[negative]	[08:16]	<danieltellez_>	i've got a problem trying to connect to a wireless network in feisty
[neutral]	[08:16]	<quaal>	@HLINK
[negative]	[08:16]	<xange>	I see my USB drive but I can't change filenames? is the because I don't have write permission to it? how do I change that?
[negative]	[08:16]	<safrus>	im using the live cd i think, i running off the cd right now
[negative]	[08:16]	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, maybe in his grub file there are this # marks in front so they dont show ? possible?
[negative]	[08:16]	<debaser>	J^zon: ok
[neutral]	[08:17]	<debaser>	J^zon: luck
[neutral]	[08:17]	<ratmtattat>	exit
[neutral]	[08:17]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
[neutral]	[08:17]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: no..
[negative]	[08:17]	<Stig>	taggie: When I open an application or something, it goes up to 100% :O
[negative]	[08:17]	<kiersie>	kiersie: when i install ubuntu 7.04 AMD64 i get an led flickering on the display and no screen does any to oplossen
[negative]	[08:17]	<taggie>	stig, ah, well, then it's definitely throttling. just not giving you control. dunno what to suggest beyond posting a question to the forum.
[positive]	[08:17]	<surviver>	IndyGunfreak, oke :)
[negative]	[08:17]	<Zenerek>	taggie: i have already setup the array from the fasttrak menu, that'ss why i was asking about only seeing two disks and not a whole mass in gparted,does it matter if ubuntu is installed already or not?
[negative]	[08:17]	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: he has grub, its on the other drive, why he's not restarted like i todl him to, i don't know.
[positive]	[08:17]	<debaser>	J^zon: brb XD
[negative]	[08:17]	<|ringo|>	Delco2: sorry, im lagging.  I dont know what switch to use thats comparable to your other distro
[negative]	[08:17]	<Stig>	taggie: when I am idle it's 50%, pretty cool I guess. But I would like it to be 50% all the time when in battery power!
[negative]	[08:17]	<kahrytan>	Houston, We have a problem.
[neutral]	[08:17]	<Delco2>	|ringo|, ok. thanks
[negative]	[08:17]	<Woody_>	so f-spot is better than Picasa delire?
[negative]	[08:17]	<taggie>	Zenerek, it shouldn't matter if it's installed yet or not. i'm not sure why gparted would see two disks
[negative]	[08:17]	<Morget>	"I'm getting ""/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"" on booting the desktop CD.  I googled, and a ton of people have been having the same problem, since Ubuntu v6!  Any solution?"

[negative]	[08:18]	<safrus>	i'll re-install and then change boot sequence if it doesnt work

[negative]	[08:19]	<Stig>	taggie: Oh wait, I just switched to battery power and it's at 50% all the time now. So I guess it automatically changes the CPU settings. I don't know, I will ask on the forums. Thanks for the help anyway.
[positive]	[08:19]	<Woody_>	ardchoille: yes sir
[negative]	[08:19]	<frojnd>	why is my soudn all weired when I connect headphones ???? plase help? If I have speakers sound is OK, but when swich the cables sound is all weird.. any ideas??
[neutral]	[08:19]	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, that explains much
[negative]	[08:19]	<delire>	mrcreativity: we got it working together. let me guess, you rebooted and it doesn't work?
[negative]	[08:19]	<Delco2>	anyone? what command line is needed to run the live cd, totally in RAM and noMDA???  eg. boot: live ram noMDA ???

[negative]	[08:49]	<ricmik>	but why does kubuntu exist anyway?
[neutral]	[08:49]	<delire>	bjoern_: perhaps you should look into Envy. i know that's not a popular thing to say around here, but given the Ubuntu Way is currently broken..
[neutral]	[08:50]	<Flannel>	ricmik: because some people prefer KDE
[negative]	[08:50]	<Drk_Guy>	64 bits is a technology that is so new

[negative]	[09:02]	<braveheartlion>	"Has anyone hin here tried the ""verify CD"" or ""check CD for defects"" on the ubuntu 7.04 install CD? When I tried it, my screen blanked out."
[positive]	[09:02]	<Delco2>	Flannel. I think it that its not recognising my CD Rom drive when it starts to install
[negative]	[09:02]	<goodman>	"mrcreativity: i think so.  try right-clicking the desktop icon in the bottom right and add more desktops.  then reenable the cube effect from the ""Desktop Effects"" settings window"
[neutral]	[09:02]	<IndyGunFreak>	lol
[negative]	[09:02]	<talisein>	lilrayray: right, but since it appears that everything goes into 1 directory, I'm wondering where /usr/lib/hxplayer came from
[negative]	[09:02]	<Meshezabeel>	wow, so Edgy's system requirements were only 128MB, whereas Feisty is 256MB???
[negative]	[09:02]	<papatwilight>	i know i sead this the other day but i' much inpressed with feisty over edgy
[neutral]	[09:03]	<thenetduck>	does anyone know how to tabb through windows?
[neutral]	[09:03]	<kowal>	hi
[negative]	[09:03]	<concept10>	thenetduck: thats on by default
[negative]	[09:03]	<mrcreativity>	woah...i think i just saw it
[negative]	[09:03]	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: Did you verify the md5 of the ISO before burning?  Did you burn at 4x?
[neutral]	[09:03]	<mrcreativity>	damn
[neutral]	[09:03]	<_ac3_>	nobody here using git?
[negative]	[09:03]	<kkathman>	thenetduck,  what do you mean Tab through to windows ?
[neutral]	[09:03]	<TECH_1>	Opera took right off and runs fine...thanks Indy.
[negative]	[09:03]	<digiterata>	Flannel, I'm off to look for my sources.list - any idea where I should look?
[negative]	[09:03]	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: Okay, goto System->Administration->Printing, click on add a new printer. Select the printer that is connected (hopefully it at least sees it). Then when it asks you to select a driver push the Install Driver button
[positive]	[09:03]	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: yes, i verified md5sum, and it was a match
[neutral]	[09:03]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: no.  That 256 is memory required to install via liveCD (which is up from 192 in edgy), Alt CD still installs on stuff with tiny memories.
[neutral]	[09:03]	<rob-west>	im using Virtual Machine stuff to try the new Ubuntu
[neutral]	[09:03]	<thenetduck>	concept10, how do I tab then? and how do I edit the short cuts to tabb?
[negative]	[09:03]	<lilrayray>	talisein, I beleive it contains the symbolic link, wait, unless banshee has something to do with it?
[negative]	[09:03]	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: I tried burning 4 or 5 x.
[neutral]	[09:03]	<Flannel>	digiterata: /etc/apt/sources.list
[neutral]	[09:03]	<Drk_Guy>	I ahve done that already, the file is not recognized
[neutral]	[09:04]	<concept10>	thenetduck: alt+tab
[negative]	[09:04]	<braveheartlion>	4 or 5 times. Sometimes at 4x speed, once at 20x speed or something like that
[neutral]	[09:04]	<canas>	does anyone installed beryl on ati radeon??
[positive]	[09:04]	<goodman>	mrcreativity: ^_^    there's a better compiz-settings manager than the default one... lemme find it...
[negative]	[09:04]	<concept10>	thenetduck: thats left alt
[negative]	[09:04]	<Delco2>	Flannel. do you know the command line parameters for full RAM install (no swap) and noMDA?
[negative]	[09:04]	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: Not four times.  burn at 4x speed.
[neutral]	[09:04]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: it says here that it is 256MB ... @HLINK
[negative]	[09:04]	<thenetduck>	oh... right
[neutral]	[09:04]	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: i understood your question
[positive]	[09:04]	<thenetduck>	thanks
[neutral]	[09:04]	<hendaus>	back
[neutral]	[09:04]	<concept10>	thenetduck: does it work?
[negative]	[09:04]	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: can you give me a link where you got this driver from?
[negative]	[09:05]	<braveheartlion>	I burned 4 or 5 times because every time i did, it was a failure
[neutral]	[09:05]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: right.  That's for the liveCD installer.
[negative]	[09:05]	<hendaus>	helpers~ how can i see my hard disk space?
[negative]	[09:05]	<Drk_Guy>	Ok
[neutral]	[09:05]	<Drk_Guy>	Here it is
[neutral]	[09:05]	<Drk_Guy>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[09:05]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: where can I find requirements for standard install then?
[neutral]	[09:05]	<goodman>	mrcreativity: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:05]	<braveheartlion>	has anybody here burned the 64bit ubuntu desktop iso?
[neutral]	[09:05]	<goodman>	install it with dpkg -i ...
[positive]	[09:05]	<talisein>	lilrayray: 'ls -l' on that file to see if it is a sym link, and where it points to
[negative]	[09:05]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: everywhere still seems to say 256MB, but maybe I'm missing something
[positive]	[09:06]	<eXcAliBuR>	how to create an email address using webmin ?
[neutral]	[09:06]	<Flannel>	!webmin | eXcAliBuR

[neutral]	[09:06]	<eXcAliBuR>	what...
[negative]	[09:06]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: The alternate CD can install on stuff with lower memory.  How much memory do you have?
[negative]	[09:07]	<eXcAliBuR>	i reinstalled my server just to have it
[negative]	[09:07]	<hendaus>	helpers!! how can i see my hard disk space
[neutral]	[09:07]	<ferret_0567>	Does Feisty include nm-applet/knetworkmanager and madwifi?
[neutral]	[09:07]	<Flannel>	eXcAliBuR: It hasn't been supported since dapper.
[neutral]	[09:07]	<papatwilight>	sysem moneiter
[neutral]	[09:07]	<kkathman>	hendaus,  sudo fdisk -l
[neutral]	[09:07]	<eXcAliBuR>	i have dapper
[positive]	[09:07]	<eXcAliBuR>	:D
[negative]	[09:07]	<papatwilight>	god i can't spell today :(
[negative]	[09:07]	<Flannel>	eXcAliBuR: Right.  Dapper doesn't support it.  Which is why, for instance, it's no longer in the repositories.
[positive]	[09:07]	<kahrytan>	 Someone please help me. I am having issues loading X/Gnome. When I log in, either admin or user, It just hangs before splash screen.  It works when I reboot fresh.

[negative]	[09:08]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: well I want to buy some used computers to give away with Ubuntu on them, I just need to know what the minimum I should be looking at is. I can get a 128MB 450Mhz PIII for $15.
[neutral]	[09:08]	<Woody1>	guys, whats the command to know the temperature of the CPU?
[negative]	[09:08]	<eXcAliBuR>	Flannel: so how to get my email working for my domain ?
[neutral]	[09:08]	<goodman>	So can anyone help me with the login issue?
[negative]	[09:08]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: you might look into installing Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu.
[neutral]	[09:08]	<ferret_0567>	Woody1
[neutral]	[09:08]	<CarlFK>	Meshezabeel: get them.
[neutral]	[09:08]	<Woody1>	yes ferret_0567
[neutral]	[09:09]	<kahrytan>	Mshezabeel: or just build them.
[neutral]	[09:09]	<ferret_0567>	look in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM

[neutral]	[09:09]	<kahrytan>	meshezabeel: buy some old components for Socket A/478 boards.
[negative]	[09:09]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel, CarlFK, this will be to give to people that aren't used to linux too, so would like something eye catchy, so would prefer ubuntu to xubuntu.
[positive]	[09:09]	<kahrytan>	 Someone please help me. I am having issues loading X/Gnome. When I log in, either admin or user, It just hangs before splash screen.  It works when I reboot fresh.

[neutral]	[09:09]	<talisein>	lilrayray: leave it alone
[negative]	[09:09]	<CarlFK>	128 is right on the lowest I would go.  96 works, but totaly sucks (slow), 128 is OK, 196 is 'nice' - 256 is also nice (I can hardly tell the difference)
[negative]	[09:09]	<ariks>	i'm trying to submit a bug to launchpad, but i keep getting 1 error: If your bug hasn't been reported before, please describe your problem more in detail.
[negative]	[09:10]	<lilrayray>	talisein, ok, Ill just get rid of the other folder

[neutral]	[09:10]	<Drk_Guy>	talisein, have you checked the link
[negative]	[09:10]	<talisein>	lilrayray: yeah
[negative]	[09:10]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: Well, even thought the minimum isn't 256, with lower than 256, you probably won't be too happy with the performance.  And you won't be able to run the eyecandy
[negative]	[09:10]	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: yeah I'm checking it out right now
[negative]	[09:10]	<Woody1>	ferret_0567: what is the exact command that i should put in the terminal to know the temperature of my CPU?

[negative]	[09:11]	<ferret_0567>	Woody1, you could try GKrellm too
[negative]	[09:11]	<kahrytan>	Did I stump everyone with my problem?
[positive]	[09:12]	<Meshezabeel>	lol, carlfk, people just selling them on a linux list. But it is in Canada :) I guess it would be closer to $12 american :)
[neutral]	[09:12]	<CarlFK>	Meshezabeel: the 'real' minimum is like 48 or 64mb, but that totaly sux

[negative]	[09:21]	<Pelo>	braveheartlion,  check your documentation,  mobo booklet,  waranty card,  bill of sale, or you could try and read the bios data when you boot your comp
[positive]	[09:21]	<BlackDesign>	thought so... won't download it today... My connection here sucks... it would take 50 hours :p

[negative]	[09:23]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: You mean like Ctrl-Alt-f1 does?
[negative]	[09:23]	<ferret_0567>	Darwich: copy and paste your xorg.conf to pastebin
[neutral]	[09:23]	<papatwilight>	slow typist
[negative]	[09:23]	<strixy>	Is this the proper place to ask for help setting up a server?
[negative]	[09:23]	<braveheartlion>	and if i find out that my video card is not ATI or nvidia, then what do we conclude?
[neutral]	[09:23]	<ferret_0567>	That you don't need the ATI/NVIDIA drivers
[negative]	[09:24]	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: yeah, that's for the CD install though, the regular requirements seem to be nowhere to be found
[negative]	[09:24]	<Flannel>	ariks: try this one, it's only one step: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:24]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, no.
[negative]	[09:24]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i don't know why you'd ahve that much trouble though, doesn't make much sense.
[positive]	[09:24]	<Darwich>	what is the command to xorg.conf?
[negative]	[09:24]	<Pelo>	strixy,  provided this is an ubuntu server yes,  but there is no warranty that someone will be able to help you at this time
[negative]	[09:24]	<wiking>	i have a problem of upgrading to feisty .... with udev package... i'm getting the error of (find: arithmetic overflow while converting +49394 days to a number of seconds)
[positive]	[09:24]	<ivoks>	anyone has an idea how to get glchess in 3d? :)
[neutral]	[09:24]	<strixy>	Theank you Pelo. it is.
[neutral]	[09:24]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: the Xubuntu page is a *little* more helpful: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:24]	<apo>	While we're talking about the menu.lst... I've edited it to include vga=0x0317, for framebuffer support, but when I reboot a second time, it's not there anymore...
[negative]	[09:24]	<apo>	Does anybody know what program causes this?
[neutral]	[09:24]	<strixy>	I'm having trouble getting MySQL to work under Ubuntu 7.04.
[neutral]	[09:24]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: it says 128Mb to run from cd, 192 to install
[negative]	[09:24]	<osirisx11>	help request: the mute button on my laptop does not light up when muted
[negative]	[09:24]	<Flannel>	apo: Where did you add it?
[neutral]	[09:24]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, it starts X11 with a terminal
[negative]	[09:24]	<safrus>	im sure i was doing something wrong
[positive]	[09:24]	<Darwich>	ferret_0567: what is the command to xorg.conf?
[negative]	[09:25]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: I will tell you that whatever the problem also prevents Firestarter from loading completely. I only get Metacity theme and blank window.
[negative]	[09:25]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: maybe.., are you editing menu.lst?
[neutral]	[09:25]	<apo>	Flannel: One second
[negative]	[09:25]	<strixy>	I can connect to MySQL on the command line, but not through the web. I have php-mysql mod installed.
[negative]	[09:25]	<safrus>	i just edited now
[negative]	[09:25]	<safrus>	before i wasn't because i didnt have access to it from live cd
[negative]	[09:25]	<goodman>	(and that's the lite version.... for regular Ubuntu I think you'd need at least 256Mb to run well.. but like others said, you *can* run it on less.... it is just slow)
[negative]	[09:25]	<aro>	Does Linux allow root partitions to be installed on USB drives?
[positive]	[09:25]	<kkathman>	Darwich,  its at /etc/X11/xorg.conf I believe
[positive]	[09:25]	<apo>	kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=bfcce436-74d6-4169-a9b8-e6ae0d115c96 ro quiet splash
[neutral]	[09:25]	<apo>	After that.
[negative]	[09:25]	<safrus>	i have one other messed up problem
[negative]	[09:25]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: you changed the ones that didn't have the # sign in front of it, right?
[neutral]	[09:25]	<apo>	And framebuffer *does* work
[neutral]	[09:25]	<safrus>	yes indy
[negative]	[09:25]	<apo>	But only for one boot.
[negative]	[09:25]	<nakor>	hello. I have a quick question. How can I tell what version of ubuntu I have installed? Thanks.
[neutral]	[09:25]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: what else/
[neutral]	[09:25]	<safrus>	i have to disconnect and reconnect my mouse every reboot
[positive]	[09:25]	<Darwich>	kkathman: permission denied ?
[negative]	[09:25]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB I assume you want me to do X11 to narrow it down to Gnome or X?
[positive]	[09:26]	<safrus>	its a razer copperhead
[negative]	[09:26]	<Flannel>	apo: righ.  You want to add it up at the top, there's some commented lines.  Add it there.  kopt= for one
[neutral]	[09:26]	<Hattori>	any pureftpd user?
[negative]	[09:26]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: that doesn't make any sense.
[neutral]	[09:26]	<kkathman>	Darwich,  edit with your favorite editor at root
[neutral]	[09:26]	<AndreasB>	not exactly
[positive]	[09:26]	<qsu>	what is the new version for ubuntu
[negative]	[09:26]	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: yeah, but still is talking about running and installing from the live CD, absolutely no mention of the requirments of it just being run on your hard drive
[neutral]	[09:26]	<CokeNCode>	What proggie would you guys recommend for editing audio files ?
[negative]	[09:26]	<AndreasB>	you start X11 with a plain xsession
[neutral]	[09:26]	<IndyGunFreak>	qsu: 7.04
[negative]	[09:26]	<safrus>	on google i see other people have that problem too

[neutral]	[09:26]	<kkathman>	darich,  ie.e  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     but back up first
[negative]	[09:26]	<braveheartlion>	"ferret_0567: i meant, if i findou out that my video card is not ATI or nvidia, can i conclude that the problem with ""Check CD  for defects"" blanking out my computer is not related to my video card?"

[neutral]	[09:26]	<IndyGunFreak>	qsu: gutsy gibbon.. 7.10
[negative]	[09:26]	<CokeNCode>	platman, audacity does that ... thanks , didn't even know
[negative]	[09:27]	<safrus>	i had the problem intermittently with windows as well though so i dont think its linux specific
[negative]	[09:27]	<nakor>	I should mention, I don't have GUI access - it's a headless server.
[neutral]	[09:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: doesn't sound it.
[neutral]	[09:27]	<raccoonsounds>	Has anyone found problems with their wireless cards and Ndiswrapper after upgrading to Fiesty Fawn?
[negative]	[09:27]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: if it's really a big deal, you can get ram from newegg for like $20/256Mb (i guess that'd be around $25 canadian)
[negative]	[09:27]	<safrus>	its just consistent with linux
[neutral]	[09:27]	<kkathman>	Darwich,  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     but back up first
[neutral]	[09:27]	<ctothej>	this is slightly off-topic, but is there a Z-notation editor available?

[neutral]	[09:27]	<safrus>	i'll use my sons computer to try and update the firmware
[positive]	[09:27]	<kkathman>	or use your favorite editor
[neutral]	[09:27]	<eternaljoy>	does anyone know of a newsreader for Ubuntu that is good, and which is also supports SSL?
[negative]	[09:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i have no idea, doesn't make sense.. is it a PS2 mouse, or a USB mouse/
[negative]	[09:27]	<aro>	Does Linux allow root partitions to be installed on USB drives?
[negative]	[09:27]	<Flannel>	ariks: Nice.  Well, That's a bug in launchpad I guess.  Theyve changed the UI... in the past few days even.  Seem to be infected by web two point oh.   Do you have javascript enabled?  Since, theres been bugs reported... even two minutes ago.
[neutral]	[09:27]	<safrus>	usb
[negative]	[09:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no idea.
[neutral]	[09:28]	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: k, thanks, still think it strange that the actual running requirements aren't listed on @HLINK
[negative]	[09:28]	<eternaljoy>	aro, im running Ubunu off a USB drive
[positive]	[09:28]	<safrus>	its a gaming mouse, not really standard
[positive]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,   does pan support ssh ?  its a good news aggregator
[positive]	[09:28]	<aro>	Thanks eternaljoy
[neutral]	[09:28]	<safrus>	since it operates at 2000 dpi
[positive]	[09:28]	<wiking>	any ideas? :)
[negative]	[09:28]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, whats aggregator mean?
[negative]	[09:28]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: yeah it might do them some good to put that on there
[negative]	[09:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats probably part of the prob... i've got a cheap best buy brand 2 buttons and wheel mouse.. 12 bucks, works fine.
[negative]	[09:28]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: with all linux, there really aren't 'minimums' per sey.  You just get a sliding scale of responsiveness and stuff.
[neutral]	[09:28]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, and no, it doesnt support SSL.
[neutral]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  news reader and organizer
[negative]	[09:28]	<kahrytan>	andreas: that worked somewhat. No titlebars.  and xterm is in the bottom right. half covered up.
[negative]	[09:28]	<nakor>	so I guess my question really is, how can I tell what version of ubuntu is installed from the command line. Thanks.
[neutral]	[09:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you sure you edited your menu correctly, so it will work when you reboot?
[negative]	[09:28]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  ahh ok  didnt know - I use pan
[negative]	[09:29]	<safrus>	im gonna reboot now and see
[negative]	[09:29]	<Lolita>	Hello anyone tell me how to fix problem with punkbuster on PB enabled servers[ COD2 ]  error
[neutral]	[09:29]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, i heard theres a way to get it run SSL, but im not sure
[negative]	[09:29]	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: ok, good luck./.
[neutral]	[09:29]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, from the xterm you start gnome-session
[neutral]	[09:29]	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: well, there are minimums, but the minimum is so astronomically low (and gives you crappy quality) that most people wouldnt have that issue
[neutral]	[09:29]	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, may I pls PM you for 2secs?
[negative]	[09:29]	<leroi_>	when i have gdesklets running and i open firefox it takes me to www.%n.com instead of my home page
[neutral]	[09:29]	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: actually, that alien -i command needs to be run through sudo
[positive]	[09:29]	<safrus>	thanks for help, its appreciated
[neutral]	[09:29]	<leroi_>	anyone know how to fix that
[positive]	[09:29]	<apo>	Flannel: Thanks.
[negative]	[09:29]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, this should give you loads of usefull trace messages
[neutral]	[09:29]	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  sure
[negative]	[09:29]	<Drk_Gu1>	Ok, i am tring
[neutral]	[09:29]	<apo>	Should work now... I hope
[positive]	[09:29]	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: also, here it is for 6.10: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:29]	<antidrugue>	leroi_: what is your shortcut to firefox?
[negative]	[09:29]	<goodman>	dunno where the 7.04 one is though
[negative]	[09:29]	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: yeah I know this is the same with any OS, but still good to see suggested requirements nonetheless
[negative]	[09:29]	<antidrugue>	"leroi_: is it just ""firefox"" or ""firefox %n"" ?"
[neutral]	[09:30]	<leroi_>	i dragged the icon into the gdesklet bar
[neutral]	[09:30]	<goodman>	(probably not out yet)
[neutral]	[09:30]	<_StefanS_>	Anyone aware of a thunderbird 2.0 deb for feisty ?
[negative]	[09:30]	<antidrugue>	"leroi_: right click on it and make sure it is just ""firefox"""
[negative]	[09:30]	<h4wk_>	E: Couldn't find package beryl-ubuntu
[negative]	[09:30]	<h4wk_>	:(
[positive]	[09:30]	<Meshezabeel>	k, thanks again goodman
[negative]	[09:30]	<leroi_>	antidrugue: thanks alot dude that was teh problem
[negative]	[09:31]	<sc0tch>	In Feisty, is the linux-386 package JUST the generic kernel without SMP support or is it something else?
[neutral]	[09:31]	<antidrugue>	leroi_: no problem
[neutral]	[09:31]	<antidrugue>	"h4wk_: do you have the ""universe"" repository enabled?"
[negative]	[09:31]	<h4wk>	thought i did
[negative]	[09:31]	<Kensey>	I've got Beryl running and having two issues: 1) Terminal Server *really* hates it when I change a setting, so much so that the entire box locks up.  2) Somehow my cube is no longer a cube - when I hit Ctrl-Alt-[arrow]  I just get a flat set of thumbnail icons and the desktop flips.  Any ideas?
[neutral]	[09:31]	<h4wk>	Ahh
[neutral]	[09:31]	<antidrugue>	h4wk_: make sure in System->Administration->Software Repositories
[negative]	[09:31]	<Flannel>	sc0tch: No.  Its a lot different than generic.  Dont believe it contains any of the optional optomizations (that get detected and used), it's there incase your processor doesn't like those detections
[positive]	[09:31]	<talisein>	sc0tch: the kernel is adaptive. If your system supports SMP, it will include SMP support. If not, it will automatically delete the SMP from itself
[neutral]	[09:32]	<braveheartlion>	will the alternate cd be a quicker install
[neutral]	[09:32]	<braveheartlion>	?
[neutral]	[09:32]	<nakor>	Can someone tell me how to determine the installed version of ubuntu from the command line? Thanks.

[neutral]	[09:33]	<braveheartlion>	?
[negative]	[09:33]	<kkathman>	Darwich,  dont mess with xorg.conf unless you know what you are doing, and back up your current version before making any changes
[positive]	[09:33]	<rainwalker>	Can someone recommend what they think would be the best way to back up one's home directory?

[positive]	[09:33]	<apo>	Backups are for cowards! :P
[positive]	[09:33]	<antidrugue>	braveheartlion: no more then a bit, but it is a more complex installation, with a bit more options
[negative]	[09:34]	<defjux_>	hi id like to set up an http server can anyone tell me how to do this?
[negative]	[09:34]	<rainwalker>	apo: Aye, but I've borked up waayyy too many things and regretted not being able to go back and fix them
[neutral]	[09:34]	<defjux_>	or the best way, i should say.

[positive]	[09:34]	<antidrugue>	i personnaly prefer it (the alternate CD), as it is a bit more reliable (specialy compared to the Xubuntu & Kubuntu install)
[positive]	[09:34]	<kane77>	defjux_, apache (or lamp...) :)
[negative]	[09:34]	<Flannel>	defjux_: that URL.  If you *just* want apache, only do the apache parts (not php/sql)

[negative]	[09:48]	<Puppy_>	talisein: Thank's for you help. I got  firefox to work in another account, so it looks like any problems I might have are limited to one account. My big concern was firefox's password storing feature being compromised... Anyway, thanks for your time.

[neutral]	[09:49]	<mwe>	!beryl | Darwich
[negative]	[09:49]	<braveheartlionWi>	ok. but first things first. When I run CHeck CD for defects on my ubuntu7.04 64bit desktop iso burned onto a cd, the monitor blanks out.
[positive]	[09:49]	<ubotu>	Darwich: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[neutral]	[09:49]	<eternaljoy>	debaser, its good according to your opinion. Its relative
[neutral]	[09:49]	<braveheartlionWi>	should'nt I first confirm that the CD has NO defects?

[negative]	[09:49]	<georges>	antidrugue: do you know if ubuntu has a search engine to search for a file in the complete repository. I think debian has something like that
[positive]	[09:49]	<sacater>	is there a command i can use to turn down volume, a single-use command in terminal, i.e one notch

[neutral]	[09:50]	<vox754>	braveheartlionWi, so do most of us, but not all applications work correctly in 64 bit environment, not all packages have been ported
[negative]	[09:50]	<PriceChild>	sacater, what's wrong with alsamixer?
[neutral]	[09:50]	<debaser>	eternaljoy: or the one from KDE
[negative]	[09:51]	<sacater>	delire: im trying to configure my keyboard, but xfce-keyboard-settings only lets me assign one command to a hotkey, so i need a once control

[positive]	[09:52]	<eternaljoy>	Kensey, doesnt support SSL
[negative]	[09:52]	<vox754>	braveheartlionWi, 64 bit are okay for servers who manage lots of files and need a lot of memory and don't need fancy gui desktops
[neutral]	[09:52]	<debaser>	scienceboy: you can do that by pressing 'e' when GRUB comes up

[neutral]	[09:52]	<eck>	NemesisD: then I think the error message is printed by the windows bootloader (which is chainloaded after grub)

[neutral]	[09:53]	<kkathman>	braveheartlionXP  well you can, but just keep in mind there are thngs that are still challenging - codecs, audio, etc in some cases
[negative]	[09:53]	<Gecko>	or possibly a lart
[negative]	[09:53]	<sacater>	delire: let me see...
[negative]	[09:53]	<NemesisD>	oh dear
[neutral]	[09:53]	<debaser>	scienceboy: we must know what we must change
[neutral]	[09:53]	<rainwalker>	so what other ways of backing up a home directory are there besides tarballing it?
[negative]	[09:53]	<scienceboy>	debaser: pressing 'e' didn't do anything, but pressing 'esc' did
[negative]	[09:53]	<braveheartlionXP>	kkathman: really? i didn't know that
[positive]	[09:53]	<antidrugue>	georges: is that the right one?
[negative]	[09:53]	<eck>	NemesisD: i'm sure you can find something in the forums
[negative]	[09:53]	<debaser>	scienceboy: please repeat me the error (the kernel panic)
[negative]	[09:53]	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, you won't see much of a performance increase in 64bit ubuntu unless you do heavy opensshd or a couple of other apps.
[negative]	[09:53]	<braveheartlionXP>	so why should anyone want to use 64 bit ubuntu, then?

[neutral]	[09:54]	<kerik>	anybody here with experience on the Canon Pixma IP4000 in Feisty?

[positive]	[09:55]	<braveheartlionXP>	PriceChild: I was planning on insntalling 64bit ubuntu on my 64bit computer, which i plan on using for websurfing, gimp, ipod syncing (gtkpod), basic stuff
[positive]	[09:55]	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, there are many apps which aren't on 64bit like flash which you'll probably want.
[neutral]	[09:55]	<eck>	mrcreativity: you need the pam keyring package
[neutral]	[09:55]	<debaser>	scienceboy: what happened when you pressed esc?
[neutral]	[09:55]	<scotty>	Is there any easy way to make Firefox open a new tab when you middle click a link in Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[09:55]	<mrcreativity>	eck: the pam keyring package?
[positive]	[09:55]	<tbuss>	to configure 5.1 you need alsa /sound card driver and you need to configure ~/.asoundrc? is this correct
[negative]	[09:55]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: No.  I just know both started acting up at the sametime.
[neutral]	[09:55]	<debaser>	scotty: use opera
[neutral]	[09:55]	<braveheartlionXP>	PriceChild: i see. and now I'm very discouraged from using 64 bit ubuntu
[neutral]	[09:55]	<scotty>	Debaser: No

[positive]	[09:55]	<Kensey>	and still work even after cracking skulls!
[neutral]	[09:55]	<Crav>	scotty: get the tabbrowser preferences extension, than it'll be in the extension options
[negative]	[09:55]	<blazemonger>	how do i use flashplayer in gnewsense
[negative]	[09:55]	<eck>	mrcreativity: download libpam-keyring and read this: @HLINK
[positive]	[09:55]	<Armageddon00>	scotty: i believe there is an option in firefox for opening new links
[negative]	[09:55]	<mrcreativity>	scotty: thats happens by default, use an addon called tab mix plus
[neutral]	[09:55]	<stinger05>	is there a visual program that comes with feisty fawn to show me the built-in programs ?
[positive]	[09:55]	<aubade>	scotty: No, but you should be able to have it so when left-clicking on links outside of firefox they'll always open in a new tab.

[positive]	[09:56]	<antidrugue>	georges: no problem, the files are in the package
[positive]	[09:56]	<Kensey>	stinger05, System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
[negative]	[09:56]	<adaptr>	stinger05 if you mean every installed executable, no - just press tab twice in a console
[negative]	[09:56]	<manitoba98>	Is there a simple way to type international/accented characters in Ubuntu? On Mac OS X, for instance, I can just do Option+E, E and I'll get an E with a forward accent. I just need a simple way to do this. Any ideas?
[neutral]	[09:56]	<blazemonger>	PC juust aint cuttin it
[neutral]	[09:56]	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, info is in the faq in the main Ubuntu domain, although not everybody reads it until they've got problems.  I guess 64 bit CPU are cheap to manufacture nowadays even if you don't use them in 64 environments
[positive]	[09:56]	<debaser>	scienceboy: when GRUB comes up you must go to the Ubuntu entrance and press e
[negative]	[09:56]	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, try a lower speed
[neutral]	[09:56]	<braveheartlionXP>	so my question is then: what's the use of someone buying a more expensive 64 bit computer if the performance will be the same?
[positive]	[09:56]	<antidrugue>	georges i just verifyed
[positive]	[09:56]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Loads fine when I reboot.
[negative]	[09:56]	<georges>	antidrugue: ok, give me your download link

[neutral]	[09:56]	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, well it isn't if everything you use is written for 64bit... but its not....
[negative]	[09:56]	<fuzzy_logic>	keithg: what errors do you get?
[negative]	[09:57]	<blazemonger>	and then have everything be over

[negative]	[09:57]	<scienceboy>	debaser: and how do we figure that out
[neutral]	[09:57]	<scienceboy>	?

[negative]	[09:58]	<Armageddon00>	When i try to burn the Ubuntu ISO with K3b it gives me an unknown error (code 254), does anyone know how to fix this, or if there is a channel for K3b/cdrecord?
[positive]	[09:58]	<eck>	mrcreativity: PAM is the system that ubuntu uses for authentication. It does the authentication when you login, when you ssh in, when you unlock the screen, etc.
[negative]	[09:58]	<arooni>	can i change the commands that get sent to alsamxer when i do the volume up keys on my sony laptop's keyboard (feisty)?  (i want the front channel to stay muted if it already is)
[neutral]	[09:58]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: It doesn't hang. It only hangs when I log back out. and log back in.
[negative]	[09:58]	<debaser>	scienceboy: and what does the kernel root option say (in the kernel line)?
[negative]	[09:58]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan,  because I think the firewall settings went Bad
[positive]	[09:58]	<ferret_0567>	WindblozeStinkz: are you still there?

[negative]	[09:58]	<antidrugue>	za: everyone here i guess
[negative]	[09:58]	<eck>	mrcreativity: this adds some instructions to the GDM component of PAM to ask it to try to authenticate your gnome keyring with your login password as you login

[negative]	[09:58]	<scotty>	It must have something to do with the fact that I'm using a USB mouse.
[negative]	[09:58]	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: yeah I had the same problem
[neutral]	[09:58]	<za>	Can anyone help me with it?
[neutral]	[09:58]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, did you purge it too?
[neutral]	[09:59]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, solve it?

[neutral]	[09:59]	<debaser>	*what's happening
[neutral]	[09:59]	<kerik>	!printer
[neutral]	[09:59]	<kahrytan>	Andreas: doesn't Complete Removal do that?
[neutral]	[09:59]	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, don't worry, I've downloaded 64 bit distros too, and now I know I'm on the safe side with 32 bit.  Supposedly, best distro for 64 bit is Gentoo, where you compile everything, and you still have to set a few programs to run in 32 bit
[positive]	[09:59]	<ubotu>	Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - Printer sharing: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:59]	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, because when you just deinstall the settings remain

[positive]	[09:59]	<ferret_0567>	RTL8139 based ethernet cards work really well
[negative]	[09:59]	<eck>	mrcreativity: i think the idea is that down the road this will just be part of the default pam policy, but for now you have to do it manually
[negative]	[09:59]	<za>	Nothing I am on the wired network and I am trying to install my network card.  It is for my laptop
[neutral]	[09:59]	<ferret_0567>	For Wireless, you should get Atheros
[negative]	[09:59]	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok
[negative]	[09:59]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, well, I've tried compiling it too...and that fails
[positive]	[10:00]	<NemesisD>	ok guys so these guides are saying boot from xp cd, run recovery console and do fdisk /mbr, but doesn't this make grub go away?
[negative]	[10:00]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	AndreasB, which version are you using truecrypt with?
[negative]	[10:00]	<debaser>	scienceboy: go to the root line and press 'e'
[negative]	[10:00]	<keithg>	fuzzy_logic: @HLINK  There it is, and that solution on that page doesn't work.  I tried it out.
[negative]	[10:00]	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: yeah, that's what I did... there was no package when I tried
[negative]	[10:00]	<tbuss>	how is it possible to configure sb audigy for 5.1? I have installed alsa and ran speaker-test -c 6 -D surround51 Is there anything else I need to do
[negative]	[10:00]	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok, what now?
[negative]	[10:00]	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: It got purged. Wizard came back as if it was the first time. when I tried it a minute ago.
[neutral]	[10:00]	<mstevens>	anyone help with NetworkManager? It's refusing to talk to my access point. Worked in edgy pre-nm.
[negative]	[10:00]	<mystread>	Just a question - can 64bit Ubuntu run 32bit processes?
[neutral]	[10:00]	<ferret_0567>	za: try 'lspci | grep -i eth', without quotes, in Applications > Accessories > Terminal
[neutral]	[10:00]	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: I don't want to leave ubuntu. It's the first linux i've ever used, and I've fallen in love over it.
[negative]	[10:00]	<blazemonger>	i want something where i don't have to do alot of reading tech manuals too
[positive]	[10:00]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	NemesisD, then grub is not in the MBR...perhaps in its own partition
[neutral]	[10:00]	<debaser>	scienceboy: there should be a prompt, and you should be able to edit that line.
[neutral]	[10:00]	<eck>	mystread: yes
[neutral]	[10:00]	<scienceboy>	debaser: yes, i can
[neutral]	[10:00]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, but it compiled for you?
[positive]	[10:00]	<antidrugue>	mstevens: so this is a system you upgraded, or a clean installation?
[positive]	[10:01]	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, then we strongly recommend the 32 bit version
[neutral]	[10:01]	<mstevens>	anti: upgrade
[negative]	[10:01]	<blazemonger>	something i can connect my synths to and have sequencer record midi/audio data
[neutral]	[10:01]	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: yes, just couldnt inject itself into the kernel
[negative]	[10:01]	<NemesisD>	"SpaceBassLaptop, so will fdisk /mbr fix my ""a disk read error occurred"" error when booting windows but it won't touch GRUB?"
[positive]	[10:01]	<braveheartlionXP>	is there a way to install Ubuntu from hard drive (as opposed to a CD)?
[neutral]	[10:01]	<debaser>	scienceboy:  you must change (hd0,0) for the correct one
[neutral]	[10:01]	<eck>	mystread: by default though all the packages and whatnot that you download will be compiled as 64 bit, however
[negative]	[10:01]	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: ok.
[negative]	[10:01]	<fuzzy_logic>	hmm i dont know keithg.. sorry
[negative]	[10:01]	<antidrugue>	mstevens: does it just not connect, does it give you any error?
[negative]	[10:01]	<mstevens>	anti: I got as far as deleting my interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces so networkmanager would take them over
[negative]	[10:01]	<scienceboy>	debaser: whats the correct one?
[positive]	[10:01]	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, its a real bummer
[negative]	[10:01]	<debaser>	scienceboy: you have ubuntu in the first master disk, don't you?
[neutral]	[10:01]	<salaah>	why doesnt the shutdown buttong show restart and shutdown?
[positive]	[10:01]	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: maybe one day, ubuntu64bit will be as good as ubuntu32bit
[negative]	[10:01]	<mstevens>	it sees the list of APs, I can enter the key, then it whirls a bit and fails to connect
[negative]	[10:01]	<scienceboy>	debaser: what do you mean?
[neutral]	[10:02]	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: not sure why someone hasn't packaged it
[positive]	[10:02]	<kahrytan>	braveheart: that will happen when everyone has 64bit
[negative]	[10:02]	<keithg>	fuzzy_logic: OK, thanks. I'll keep googling for a solution.
[positive]	[10:02]	<talisein>	omg, suspend works on my computer
[negative]	[10:02]	<antidrugue>	mstevens : that's good, did you happen to read my tutorial (@HLINK ?
[positive]	[10:02]	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: it is a nice program

[neutral]	[10:02]	<salaah>	so...
[positive]	[10:02]	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, it will, it all depends on compilation and using the 64 bit properly
[positive]	[10:02]	<fuzzy_logic>	keithg: good luck :)
[negative]	[10:02]	<salaah>	i dont want to reinstall
[neutral]	[10:02]	<h4wk_>	humm

[negative]	[10:03]	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok, then you must change the second 0 for 1 and, if that doesn't work, change it for 2
[negative]	[10:03]	<ferret_0567>	h4wk_: paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file into pastebin
[negative]	[10:03]	<surviver>	salaah, u can do this then with sudo shutdown -h or sudo reboot ... maybe make a link to the buttons ...

[negative]	[10:07]	<debaser>	scienceboy: that error means the root in the kernel line is not correct, but since ubuntu manages the partitions with UIDs I don't know how to do it
[negative]	[10:07]	<benlake>	BadaR: also, if you are trying to setup a real server, use the server version and there is an option on boot that says install LAMP server

[positive]	[10:09]	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: it's probably loading the bcm43xx driver but you need to run the util to grab the firmware which makes it work

[negative]	[10:22]	<brunoUT>	how did he do that?
[negative]	[10:22]	<kahrytan>	soundray:  And errors related to the fact I am logged in as a user.
[negative]	[10:22]	<debaser>	jeffwheeler that's surely not a simple task, but you can look for scripts in google or a manual maybe
[negative]	[10:22]	<Enselic__>	From what I understand, rsync only transmits changes to files over the network. I assume this implies that sensitive information e.g. stuff in ~/.ssh won't be transmitted unless for those files that change, e.g. known_hosts?

[negative]	[10:37]	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: well. I have bad news for you. linux-printing.org classifies your printer as a paperweight. It doesn't look like you will be able to use that printer in linux. To be sure though, I recommend you go to the ubuntu forums and request support there. It might attract the attention of someone who knows specifically about this printer
[negative]	[10:37]	<debaser>	Armageddon00: is it a reader or writer?
[negative]	[10:37]	<busfahrer>	talisein: It seems that argument can only change resolution but not refresh rate... any other idea?

[positive]	[10:39]	<sphynx>	delire: Normal gnome network-admin dosen't support WPA encyption
[neutral]	[10:39]	<debaser>	Armageddon00: then search for a CD/DVD writer support linux database, there should be something
[neutral]	[10:39]	<kahrytan>	soundray: Yes, it is complete.
[negative]	[10:39]	<mstevens>	woo! I'm not sure what I changed, but at least for the moment it's working.
[negative]	[10:40]	<Armageddon00>	debaser, ok will do
[negative]	[10:40]	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: just after booting... but it doesn't say it anymore, looks like I messed up the partition table while trying to rescue from the LiveCD
[neutral]	[10:40]	<speedy1276>	Anyone know about configuring WPA with static IP address ?
[negative]	[10:40]	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: 1.8.5 comes with ubuntu, you should probably use that, do you need .6?
[neutral]	[10:40]	<debaser>	scienceboy: mount /dev/hdnx /mount
[neutral]	[10:40]	<soundray>	kahrytan: how long have you waited at the hanging stage?
[negative]	[10:40]	<Seb3DGE>	if I use the liveCD and do sudo gparted I see an empty disk, however I can navigate into it and see all the files in nautilus
[neutral]	[10:40]	<debaser>	scienceboy: you must know what hardrive you must use
[negative]	[10:40]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I only let it sit for minute or two.
[negative]	[10:41]	<delire>	elsni: i don't know what's happening with sound on your system. you'd do well to search in the forums. i see this bug: @HLINK

[positive]	[10:41]	<Seb3DGE>	all I see now is a blinking cursor on a black screen :P
[positive]	[10:41]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: after booting which one of the three, Ubuntu, Vista or XP? or before that?
[neutral]	[10:41]	<arooni>	chernobylrpgfree: yes!  breakpoint() is broken in 1.8.5
[negative]	[10:41]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I'll try again and wait bit longer.
[negative]	[10:41]	<soundray>	kahrytan: no, that should be enough.

[neutral]	[10:41]	<scienceboy>	cya
[negative]	[10:41]	<debaser>	scienceboy: you should try to mount /dev/hda1 /media/somedirectory
[negative]	[10:41]	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: ah.  You'll have to uninstall the ubuntu-supported version and get it yourself.
[negative]	[10:42]	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I set it up like the tutorial said, so I had the Vista menu that allowed to boot to ubuntu
[neutral]	[10:42]	<elsni>	delire: ok thank you
[neutral]	[10:42]	<delire>	sphynx: you'll have to use another tool for that.
[negative]	[10:42]	<arooni>	chernobylrpgfree: bwah ;(
[negative]	[10:42]	<delire>	elsni: sorry i can't help. many people are having problems with this card in Feisty.
[negative]	[10:42]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: oh... that's different
[positive]	[10:42]	<Seb3DGE>	after I upgraded XP to SP2 I could still boot in XP and Vista, but after choosing Ubuntu I had the error
[neutral]	[10:42]	<delire>	elsni: this problem should be fixed soon. it's important you report a bug in that page.

[neutral]	[10:43]	<Journeyman>	Flannel: yes I do
[negative]	[10:44]	<Flannel>	Seb3DGE: it means something like your kernel, or whatever, isn't found.
[neutral]	[10:44]	<Seb3DGE>	but I think my major problem now is somehow rescuing the partiton table
[neutral]	[10:44]	<ejm>	augh! I installed ubuntu 7.04, and I have a grub error 17.
[neutral]	[10:44]	<Dazz>	!nvidia
[neutral]	[10:44]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:44]	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: Good, that means bcm43xx is working.

[neutral]	[10:44]	<ferret_0567>	@HLINK
[negative]	[10:44]	<Flannel>	Seb3DGE: if it's getting past the grub menu, then it's not menu.lst, its somethig that the menu.lst calls, like your kernel file
[neutral]	[10:44]	<snap>	how can i switch back and forth between KDE and gnome?
[positive]	[10:44]	<ferret_0567>	For all of you people not using Kubuntu because you think KDE is slow
[neutral]	[10:44]	<kiersie>	arooni: try @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:44]	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: Is it an on-board sound, or a card?
[negative]	[10:44]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: can you repeat the error please?
[negative]	[10:44]	<Seb3DGE>	is it possible to rescue a partition table that has been overwritten?
[positive]	[10:44]	<Flannel>	Journeyman: oh, in samba.  Hah.  Well, there you go ;)  that's what you get for using two lines for your question

[negative]	[10:45]	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: iwlist is showing eth0 eth1 but no wlan1, is this a problem?
[negative]	[10:45]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: a overwritten partition table means that the disk partitions have changed of distribution (size, number, type, etc), I don't think there's a way
[positive]	[10:45]	<keeganx>	Thank you Flannel
[negative]	[10:45]	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: urgh... not sure what to say then.

[positive]	[10:46]	<delire>	elsni: good for you my friend. be a little patient and all will be well. the Ubuntu devs have to work hard to try to get things working on every configuration.
[neutral]	[10:46]	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: I keep mine at 50% to reduce interference, but it's related to my speakers in my case.

[negative]	[10:48]	<soundray>	kahrytan: oh
[negative]	[10:48]	<soundray>	kahrytan: what did you do after that?
[negative]	[10:48]	<sam__>	hey guys im back
[negative]	[10:48]	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: that's pretty odd.  I wish I had more information for you.
[neutral]	[10:48]	<ferret_0567>	You must not have the Kubuntu KDM theme installed if your using KDM
[neutral]	[10:48]	<kahrytan>	soundray: rebooted X.
[neutral]	[10:48]	<ferret_0567>	For GDM, you changed the settings
[negative]	[10:48]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: I'm not a guru and I don't know what you're talking about, what I know is that a partition is, in linux, a device node in /dev directory. Gnome and KDE abstract that and represent the disks, but I don't think they give access to partition tables, mostly gnome.
[neutral]	[10:48]	<knoppix_>	hi
[negative]	[10:48]	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: I may have been messing with my network and card settings way to much, is there a way to reset all those settings, without reinstalling the OS?
[positive]	[10:48]	<sam__>	got a question, how do run a program like ventrilo, i downloaded the tar.gz now... i unzipped it, and it has the config file, program file, and everything all in a folder
[negative]	[10:48]	<sam__>	wht do i do to run the program??
[neutral]	[10:48]	<knoppix_>	jemand hier?
[negative]	[10:49]	<sam__>	start the server service i guess you could say
[negative]	[10:49]	<elsni>	delire: yes, i can imagine. I was just impressed that nearly everything else worked out of the box, even wlan!
[neutral]	[10:49]	<debaser>	sam__: you must surely compile it
[negative]	[10:49]	<soundray>	kahrytan: the problem is most likely not your gnome or gtk installation, but the config settings in your home directory.
[neutral]	[10:49]	<sam__>	how?
[negative]	[10:49]	<Dextorion>	snap: Then i dont know. The default login panel for gdm comes with options for that. I dont know if your running gdm though..  Might be kde's manager peharps. No idea.
[negative]	[10:49]	<sam__>	how do i compile it
[positive]	[10:49]	<chernobylrpgfree>	"FeistyFlamer7: Not to my knowledge.  You could try cleaning out the changes to /etc/network/interfaces, then ""sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0"""
[negative]	[10:49]	<safrus>	how do i get root permission to a file to edit it?
[negative]	[10:49]	<LightHammer>	can somebody help me with my problem of changing menu icons?
[neutral]	[10:49]	<Sjimmie>	sam__: type: less INSTALL
[negative]	[10:49]	<Seb3DGE>	what I mean is that a partition should be invisible if the partition table is erased... but perhaps it's not, since I can navigate the disk...
[negative]	[10:49]	<debaser>	sam__: pastebin the content of the directory please
[positive]	[10:49]	<Sjimmie>	or something :)
[neutral]	[10:49]	<soundray>	kahrytan: I would create a new user and work with that for now, and see if it throws up the same problem.
[negative]	[10:49]	<kahrytan>	"Soundray: thats error log when it actually hangs. On session when it doesn't (after system restart) I get Window manager warning: """" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding ""toggle_shaded"" in addition"
[neutral]	[10:49]	<adaptr>	safrus use sudo

[positive]	[10:49]	<chernobylrpgfree>	"LightHammer: It's a real process.  Google ""gnome menu icon""."
[negative]	[10:49]	<Seb3DGE>	well, I think I don't have much choice other than reinstalling everything again... *sign*
[positive]	[10:49]	<delire>	elsni: yes there's a high hit rate with this release. still a few rough edges though. with some help from driver developers we'll get there..
[negative]	[10:50]	<LightHammer>	ok
[negative]	[10:50]	<sam__>	there is not
[negative]	[10:50]	<debaser>	sam__. the common and fast method is ./configure && make and then make install
[neutral]	[10:50]	<Sjimmie>	README ?
[neutral]	[10:50]	<sam__>	it is already like unziipped and compiled
[neutral]	[10:50]	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
[negative]	[10:50]	<sam__>	but how do i run the service??
[negative]	[10:50]	<soundray>	kahrytan: that's just a warning, it's not likely related to the hanging issue
[neutral]	[10:50]	<safrus>	sudo what?
[negative]	[10:50]	<Sp4cedOut>	Is there any way to get inux-headers-'uname -r' and build-essential from the Edgy live CD, since I don't have an interent connection
[negative]	[10:50]	<snap>	hmmmmok well I should be able to change from gnome to kde on the fly .......most other flavor of linux ive tried will doo that
[neutral]	[10:50]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: try checking the kernel image is there

[neutral]	[10:50]	<horohe>	how to work my keys fn in ubuntu  ? any peolple help me ?
[negative]	[10:50]	<adaptr>	safrus sudo whatever it is you want to do as root
[negative]	[10:50]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: and the init ram disk
[neutral]	[10:50]	<kahrytan>	soundray: what if new user doesn't fix it?
[negative]	[10:50]	<Seb3DGE>	wait, I'll boot the machine with the livecd
[neutral]	[10:50]	<ryanpg>	is there a specific linux image that enables power management of the P4?
[neutral]	[10:50]	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
[neutral]	[10:50]	<sam__>	because it has the files
[neutral]	[10:51]	<Dextorion>	"snap: how do you mean ""on the fly""?"
[neutral]	[10:51]	<sam__>	like the conf, ventrilo_srv
[negative]	[10:51]	<soundray>	kahrytan: only then would I consider a complete reinstall.
[negative]	[10:51]	<sam__>	that is the file i need to run ventilo_srv, but how do i start it or run it
[negative]	[10:51]	<LightHammer>	chernobylrpgfree: i don't mean the icons in the menu, i mean the icon from the menu
[negative]	[10:51]	<ferret_0567>	This is cool, a screenshot of Pidgin IM (which is Gaim, except they had to change the name), this version has new features: @HLINK
[negative]	[10:51]	<debaser>	chmod +x ventrilo_srv and then ./ventrilo_srv
[negative]	[10:51]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I can't use  User settings gui tool. Window doesnt load.
[neutral]	[10:51]	<ferret_0567>	brb
[neutral]	[10:51]	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
[negative]	[10:51]	<Sp4cedOut>	Is there any way to get inux-headers-'uname -r' and build-essential from the Edgy live CD, since I don't have an interent connection
[positive]	[10:51]	<soundray>	kahrytan: you have to add the new user to the admin group
[negative]	[10:51]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yeah.  You'll have to figure out what image you want for your icon, and make a change to gconf (dont know off the top of my head)
[negative]	[10:51]	<kahrytan>	Soundray: I just get Metacity theme and blank box inside.
[positive]	[10:52]	<snap>	my memory might not be correct but SuSe i could flip from different x-windows managers w/ reloging
[neutral]	[10:52]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: I did for a while.
[negative]	[10:52]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: I've done it myself, it took over an hour.
[negative]	[10:52]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: do u have a clue on how to change settings?
[negative]	[10:52]	<kahrytan>	soundray: And I am logged in as such. Just in case I needed to edit a file.
[neutral]	[10:52]	<soundray>	kahrytan: I take it back
[neutral]	[10:52]	<LightHammer>	i would replace the ubuntu logo with the gnome food
[negative]	[10:52]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: it boot at startup so i dunno how to change some setting..
[neutral]	[10:52]	<soundray>	kahrytan: do you have a terminal for entering commands?
[positive]	[10:52]	<Cosmo_>	on several games when I start them they are off kilter between my 2 monitors, is there a way I can force them into a window that can be moved betweem the monitors?
[neutral]	[10:52]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: like changing default umask
[neutral]	[10:52]	<LightHammer>	can i do thios with the gconf editor?
[negative]	[10:52]	<safrus>	im trying to save over  the xorg.conf file
[positive]	[10:52]	<Dextorion>	snap: never heard about that. :p sorry
[neutral]	[10:52]	<defjux_>	how do i restart gnome? i used to be able to go alt-ctrl-backspace to reboot shell.. it doesnt work anymore though
[positive]	[10:52]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: check for the kernel images and then change the boot configuration with 'e'
[negative]	[10:52]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yes.  I just don't remember what setting to change.
[negative]	[10:52]	<sam__>	is there anyway to integrate it??
[negative]	[10:53]	<defjux_>	how can i restart my shell?
[neutral]	[10:53]	<debaser>	(in grub)
[negative]	[10:53]	<kahrytan>	soundray: Wouldn't the fact window doesn't load be related to gnome hanging?
[negative]	[10:53]	<elsni>	delire: yes, I only dicovered one more issue: wake up does not work after suspend to ram. And going to suspend mode takes very long time. But I dont use this normally, so I dont care.
[negative]	[10:53]	<sam__>	is there anyway to make the linux server do taht on start up
[neutral]	[10:53]	<sam__>	run a program like taht??
[neutral]	[10:53]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: I know that pure-ftpd have start flags for almost everything. I remembering doing somthing quite uggly to get those settings at boot. heh
[negative]	[10:53]	<LightHammer>	ok thanks, another question do you know where i can get a gnome-food icon? a real icon not a picture from it?
[positive]	[10:53]	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: could you please tell me what to type in terminal to do so, since I'm a newbie? :P :D
[negative]	[10:53]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: like setting them in directly in the start script or something like that.
[negative]	[10:53]	<soundray>	kahrytan: probably, but the problem could still be in the config files in your home dir.
[negative]	[10:53]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: how? editing the script?
[neutral]	[10:54]	<Jove``>	sam__: Section 3 of ventrilo_srv.htm tells you quite explicitly how to do it.
[neutral]	[10:54]	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Google Image Search is your friend?  You could check gnome's homepage?  Not sure.
[neutral]	[10:54]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I am thinking GTK+ because it is the window manager. Whats the command for term?
[negative]	[10:54]	<sam__>	ok thanxs
[neutral]	[10:54]	<sam__>	...
[positive]	[10:54]	<elsni>	delire: so thank you again, I must reboot ;-)
[negative]	[10:54]	<sam__>	if i were to do teamspeak
[negative]	[10:54]	<LightHammer>	hmm ok thanks
[neutral]	[10:54]	<sam__>	would the principles be the same...
[neutral]	[10:54]	<Jove``>	Yup
[negative]	[10:54]	<soundray>	kahrytan: gtk isn't the window manager. The wm is called metacity
[negative]	[10:54]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: yeah.  /etc/init.d/whatever.. or something like that.
[neutral]	[10:54]	<sam__>	kk thxs
[neutral]	[10:54]	<Dextorion>	Hattori: not sure mate.
[negative]	[10:54]	<starz>	!paste

[negative]	[10:54]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: @HLINK is the /etc/init.d/pure-ftpd script
[negative]	[10:54]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you're with a liveCD in the affected computer, aren't you?
[neutral]	[10:54]	<Hattori>	Dextorion: u know how to add -U switch?
[positive]	[10:55]	<kahrytan>	soundray: I thought one controled title bars and other the controls

[negative]	[10:55]	<soundray>	kahrytan: replace kahrytan2 with the name you want the new user to have
[neutral]	[10:56]	<atlantis>	in fedora there is a package that adds a lot of tab completions, like for different services, likes 'ssh <tab>' would look though /etc/hosts... does anyone know if there is a package that adds that functionality for ubuntu?
[neutral]	[10:56]	<soundray>	cherva: just 'date'
[positive]	[10:56]	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you must gain access to the affected machine or move the hard disk to another one (much more complicated)
[neutral]	[10:56]	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I booted the other machine with the livecd
[negative]	[10:56]	<Seb3DGE>	I can type there as I write here

[positive]	[10:57]	<delire>	AaronMT: according to the best developers in the world, Vim.

[neutral]	[10:58]	<debaser>	delire: emacs!
[positive]	[10:58]	<soundray>	AaronMT: there's nothing similar to VisualStudio, sorry. Linux has some bad software, but not *that* bad ;)

[negative]	[11:25]	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: yeah run it on the linux box
[neutral]	[11:25]	<soundray>	deep: you need very little computational power for that. Any old Pentium will do. Even a 486, but those are rare now...
[negative]	[11:25]	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: I don't think gparted can find lost partitions
[negative]	[11:25]	<boojit>	deep: you're just routing stuff between two interfaces, with probably a dhcp server thrown in for good measure. As soundray said, you can do that with a pentium.
[neutral]	[11:25]	<boojit>	lesser hardware does exactly that on linux-based network appliances

[negative]	[11:26]	<soundray>	deep: you might actually consider buying a cheap router such as a Linksys WRT54GL, because it uses much less energy than a standard PC

[negative]	[11:27]	<atrus>	Seb3DGE: you can read the man page for parted and see if that helps, but you probabbly want to make sure you've got somebody familiar to help when you do it.
[negative]	[11:27]	<safrus>	can i get some assistance with fixing my  resolution please?
[neutral]	[11:27]	<boojit>	although soundray is right about the cheap linksys, there's a lot to be said for what you'll learn setting up your own router
[negative]	[11:27]	<deep>	soundray, i am using a router now. But it is buggy as hell. ;(
[negative]	[11:28]	<soundray>	cotton: identify the names of the packages you want to get rid of. Then run 'sudo apt-get --purge remove package1 package2' etc.

[negative]	[11:51]	<jrib>	fiction: what do you want to do with it?
[negative]	[11:51]	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: OK, well that's ruled out.  The next step is troublesome; does it work when you turn off WEP?
[negative]	[11:51]	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: It should be named BCMWL5.SYS or BCMWL5A.SYS
[negative]	[11:51]	<jrib>	cables: maybe /etc/acpi/ somewhere, but just a guess
[negative]	[11:51]	<chowmeined>	frolle: If you want something to download those, check out klibido

[negative]	[11:59]	<soundray>	weltschmerz: where did you find your music in the end?
[negative]	[11:59]	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: I thought wifi0 might be the driver in that case.  Check /etc/network/interfaces for an ath0 and a wifi0 entries.

[neutral]	[12:00]	<mwe>	!automatix
[negative]	[12:00]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[positive]	[12:00]	<DoctorOwl>	I have XP on hda and a free disk on hdc.  When I install ubuntu onto hdc on the reboot grub says stage 1.5 error 16 and hangs.  I can booted from my xp cd to do fixmbr and then boot into windows fine.  But how do I make things so I can boot into ubuntu / select between the two?
[negative]	[12:00]	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: should i ?
[negative]	[12:00]	<weltschmerz>	soundray it actually was in /usr/share/AUDIO but somehow the backup /backup/AUDIO was just ...gone.
[neutral]	[12:00]	<coal>	um
[neutral]	[12:00]	<soundray>	Tom_g: you could run firefox in a vncserver and use konqueror to connect to that screen
[negative]	[12:00]	<coal>	i can't find it on the box
[neutral]	[12:01]	<kylecasey>	mwe i have the error from the log file here but i dont know where pastebin is
[negative]	[12:01]	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: nope.  But that means wifi0 probably was the driver?

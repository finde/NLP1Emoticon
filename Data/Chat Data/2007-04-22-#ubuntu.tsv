12:16	<ardchoille>	Derek_Russo: Xine
12:16	<BHSPitMonkey>	though I can do most of what I need to do
12:16	<avb>	agnivesh: as i told, try bluefish
12:16	<LegoLinux>	My X server still won't start

12:17	<ardchoille>	Gunrun: I don't know, but usually those types of pages have a fix.
12:17	<Derek_Russo>	ardchoille: Xine gives me all sorts of problems, the movie blacks out every few seconds, etc, and it doesn't always recognize the dvd in the drive
12:17	<agnivesh>	avb: ok then, thank for your help.
12:17	<BHSPitMonkey>	you actually have to "trick" the Gnome "send to" bluetooth target into working.
12:17	<avb>	np

12:17	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, not sure what that's about either, it's where corrupt files go? or fiels not in the journaling system? either way you don't need it if the drives new
12:17	<ardchoille>	Derek_Russo: I do't use vlc because it doesn't support closed captions
12:17	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, lol ok, what is that from? Also ..... how would I go about moving my home directory to the new drive?
12:17	<LegoLinux>	I guess nobody knows how to fix the X server then

12:18	<LegoLinux>	I just posted it about a min ago
12:18	<randomwalker>	Derek_Russo: probably due to sony Arccos

12:25	<greg_g>	avb, I just read some stuff on the forums about them being tough (intel) but they are open source, so it should in theory be better than ATI or nVidia right?
12:25	<zcat[1] >	OatTop, somewhere under schreensaver / power management iirc...
12:25	<raquen>	i ve a problem with the grub list
12:25	<Ademan_>	raquen: what's your native language?

12:26	<ghostkernel>	thats weird
12:26	<wastrel>	!italian | raquen
12:26	<zcat[1] >	OatTop, you probably want it to turn off the screen, just not ask for PW when it opens again..

12:30	<ziadoz>	so its not just me
12:30	<randomwalker>	what's wrong with nm?
12:30	<teethdood>	Ichijin, read this article to get your wireless working : http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130923-page,1-c,linux/article.html
12:30	<Fylk>	What issues?
12:30	<zcat[1] >	not my machine so I only had a few days playing with it
12:30	<Horscht>	I never like DHCP anyways
12:30	<a8514>	I have that pain y some computers
12:30	<yigal>	randomwalker: it depends on what wifi card you have
12:30	<sacater>	ajehuk: thats fine mate,
12:30	<Ichijin>	thx
12:30	<hhlp>	hi, anyone kwnow why mi hards disk in feisty are recognize like scsi (sda1,sda2,sdb1) all of then are ata
12:30	<enyc>	hhlp: new ATA drivers... this is not a fault...
12:30	<yigal>	hhlp: they used a different file stack no worries
12:31	<Gigi>	Hi again!  Do you guys know if it is possible to make the Mad Dog case (for laptop hard drives) with Feisty (it never worked before, I was wondering if it is possible to make it work now)
12:31	<Fylk>	What exactly are you asking Gigi?
12:31	<ardchoille>	cotton: Her eis my sources.list, it may help you: http://ardchoille.pastebin.us/27156
12:31	<Shauny>	How can i join the ubuntu beginner team?
12:31	<enyc>	hhlp: feisty uses the "libata" stack for most PATA chipsets by default  in kernel 2.6.02  which makes the drives appear via  scsi layer  ...  this i the same framework used for SATA disks...
12:31	<Gigi>	A hard drive USB case (for 2.5'' drives) the brand is Mad Dog
12:31	<dannydrifffft>	is the nvidia geforce 7800GT supported by ubuntu 7.04?
12:32	<Fylk>	And what was the issue?
12:32	<zerro>	done that but the problem is that when i try to play videos at video.google.com i just get black screen and not more and firefox is not saying that it is missing plugins
12:32	<hhlp>	i understand thx
12:32	<Fylk>	And its not for laptop drives, just a smaller form factor.
12:32	<LegoLinux>	Thank you soooo much! My X server is running again, and is 3D-enabled!
12:32	<enyc>	hhlp: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks
12:32	<Goldy>	dannydrift: i think so, if not you can download the nvidia drivers easily :)
12:32	<LegoLinux>	Thanks again!
12:33	<Gigi>	mine too :)
12:33	<teethdood>	Ichijin, at the very end it tells you how to get wireless up
12:33	<Moosejaw>	i knew i shouldnt have upgraded to fesity yet
12:33	<dannydrifffft>	goldy, i have a problem at the beginning of installing ubuntu
12:33	<Moosejaw>	geeze,
12:33	<deserteagle>	LeoLinux: everything's good?
12:33	<LegoLinux>	what would I do without IRC?
12:33	<Fylk>	Moose, what is your issue?
12:33	<dannydrifffft>	goldy, and im guessing it's a video problem
12:33	<LegoLinux>	Yup!
12:33	<OatTop>	zcat[1] , yeah I want the screen off still... just no password prompt afterwards
12:33	<deserteagle>	i wish my X could get fixed :(
12:33	<enyc>	hhlp: but this is likely to cause some problems SOMEWHERE... jsut hopefully lal the most important problems have been either fixed... or had the "use libata for this chipset" switched-off before feisty released!
12:33	<Shauny>	how do i join the ubuntu beginner team?
12:33	<krokodyl>	hi
12:33	<Ichijin>	teethdood u got pm
12:34	<yigal>	moose: you keep complaining but give us the why then maybe we can help
12:34	<Moosejaw>	Fylk: I got my broadcom wireless to work, but it doesnt connect consistently unless i am close to the router...otherwise it wont connect from upstairs, which it ALWAYS did seemlessly with edgy
12:34	<LegoLinux>	I did: apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy, and that fixed it
12:34	<NobleCOmmerce>	Hey, I know its busy in here, but can anyone help me with nvtv? Its segfaulting aftera new install on 7.04 geforce mx440
12:34	<ghostkernel>	Dannydrift your computer is wacko!
12:34	<yigal>	moose: are you using networkmanager to connect?
12:34	<whileimhere>	will fiesty packages work with Eft?
12:34	<Fylk>	So, your issue is with signal strength.
12:34	<Tim02>	HEY GUYS,  when I run IWCONFIG it shows my adapter is conected to a network, how to I disconnect it from automaticly connecting to networks!!!\
12:34	<enyc>	**** I would like to know how to switch to older PATA drivers under feisty's kernel / initrd / system....  if needed to test  workaround  a problem... / write bugreport and all ;-) -- how do I make the older drivers take over anyway?
12:34	<ghostkernel>	maybe your graphic card is not supported
12:34	<enyc>	whileimhere: maybe
12:34	<Moosejaw>	i am using nm-applet
=== ivar is now known as ivarref
12:34	<dannydrifffft>	ghost, haha i know. i have no idea why it's doing that
12:34	<Moosejaw>	using wpa
12:34	<zerro>	try glxifo | grep rendering if it says yes you got 3d
12:34	<duress->	oi has anyone managed to get a prism54 based wnic to work with kismet?
12:34	<jikanter>	How are the UIDs in /etc/fstab generated?
12:34	<enyc>	whileimhere: best to avoid... you really need a "backport" (compile the package on edgy-eft)
12:34	<dannydrifffft>	ghost, i have a geforce 7800GT
12:34	<duress->	i keep on getting this error
12:34	<jcmcbeth>	I just upgraded from Ubuntu 6.06 to 6.10, and now the disk manager is gone and I don't know how to mount a disk.  Can someone tell me what to do?
12:35	<yigal>	moosejaw: this could easily have something to do with it, what card exactly do you have?
12:35	<krokodyl>	bye
12:35	<whileimhere>	Okay I was hoping to avoid compiling myself but oh well
12:35	<NobleCOmmerce>	jcmcbeth: man mount
12:35	<ghostkernel>	linux should have the driver for almos any nvidia graphic card
12:35	<Goldy>	danny drift, PM please
12:35	<duress->	FATAL: SetIFFlags: Unknown interface wlan0: Operation not permitted
12:35	<jikanter>	jcmcbeth: mount your disk manually with mount
12:35	<idefixx>	jikanter: on fs creation

12:35	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: in which directory did the drive use to be mounted on?
12:35	<rene->	guys i hate windows as much as every other folk, but i have to use a windows application, which is the easiest way to do it in 6.10?
12:35	<deserteagle>	rene-: try wine
12:35	<jcmcbeth>	deserteagle: /media/Storage
12:35	<yigal>	rene: what application?
12:35	<Moosejaw>	i have a broadcom card and i had to use bcm43xx-fwcutter to get it working
12:35	<zcat[1] >	rene-, dual-boot :)
12:35	<Moosejaw>	at all
12:35	<jikanter>	idefixx: thanks
12:36	<aftermath>	how do I view files on a DVD?
12:36	<Moosejaw>	yigal: I cant use the normal connection manager since it only allows wep as an option
12:36	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: ok, just type sudo mount /media/storage and see if it works
12:36	<zerro>	yea but i think since i'am new to ubuntu that there is no 3d rendering on the default driver
12:36	<rene->	zcat[1]  please god no
12:36	<ardchoille>	!3d
12:36	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about 3d - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
12:36	<Goldy>	danny dirft, can you boot in to the desktop from cd?
12:36	<rene->	deserteagle: can i apt get it?
12:37	<deserteagle>	is there anyone here who could help me with NVIDIA driver issues?
12:37	<zerro>	nvidia driver ??
12:37	<atbnet>	Any idea when I run beryl why my taskbar disappears?
12:37	<^benz^>	i installed feisty on a core 2 duo laptop with the intel ipw3945 chipset... i believe the wireless config is setup properly but during bootup it says cannot bring up eth1... however after login, i can do a /etc/init.d/networking restart and get eth1 up... i am using the 64-bit version... is this a known issue?
12:37	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: huh?
12:37	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: just type sudo mount /media/Storage
12:37	<kernel06>	avb: yes after re-login i could see my fonts
12:37	<zcat[1] >	rene-, you wanted the easiest way; I've never found wine to be easy. I guess it depends what you're trying to run.
12:37	<OatTop>	what's the preferred methods for getting emacs 22 on feisty?
12:37	<kernel06>	avb: which font do you use in application?
12:37	<Moosejaw>	fylk or yigal any idea what i can do to fix the issue?
12:37	<avb>	kernel06: congratulations :)
12:37	<soweto76>	I upgraded from Edgy to Feisty.  I read in the announcement of the new release that there  was a "wizard" of some sort to install nasty codecs.  I don't know how to access this program.
12:37	<kernel06>	avb: thanks
12:37	<rene->	what i am trying to run is a simple net application, it does uses threads and network
12:38	<jikanter>	idefixx: can I generate them again if I have my disks mounted literally?
12:38	<rene->	s/net/.NET/
12:38	<avb>	kernel06: Verdana 8
12:38	<DM|>	How does one change a root password
12:38	<willytell_>	aftermath,  what are you trying to do? playing a dvd or just view files from a dvd?
12:38	<zcat[1] >	soweto76, I think you just go ahead and try to play a 'nasty' video
12:38	<deserteagle>	DM|: you dont
12:38	<avb>	kernel06: its for 1024x768
12:38	<jcmcbeth>	deserteagle: that didn't work because I didn't tell it what device to use, and I don't know what the name of my harddrive is
12:38	<dannydrifffft>	Goldy, no i cant. also check your pm
12:38	<idefixx>	DM|: sudo passwd
12:38	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to remove all traces of a program that i installed from a binary (.bin)? it doesnt show up in synaptic, i installed it in a folder in /usr/lib/. do i just delete the folder that i installed it to?
12:38	<ardchoille>	DM|: You shouldn't have root enabled at all.
12:38	<kernel06>	avb: thanks much let me try verdana 8 to see on my desktop and resolution is same like urs.
12:38	<jupdike>	I am trying to find a way to tell Ubuntu that I have a Dell m991 monitor. How to?
12:38	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: how many hard drives do you have?
12:38	<ardchoille>	idefixx: Please don't tell people how to enable rot.
12:38	<Moosejaw>	yigal: the thing is, i am connected right now wirelessly but only 10 feet away from the router...if i go upstairs it wont connect or stay connected
12:38	<aftermath>	willytell_: view, but I just put it in my old windows to view
12:38	<jcmcbeth>	deserteagle: two
12:39	<idefixx>	DM|: on second thought no so sure.. 'sudo -i' and then passwd will work tough ;)
12:39	<zerro>	hey look at this: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty this guide can help you much ...
12:39	<jikanter>	jupdike: check the ubuntu hardware database
12:39	<giosva>	hi
12:39	<zerro>	hi
12:39	<willytell_>	aftermath, ok.
12:39	<jikanter>	jupdike: type in "lshw" to see if it is properly detected
12:39	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: how many cdroms?
12:39	<Moosejaw>	anyone else having problems with network manager and wpa?
12:39	<Derek_Russo>	Hi, I"m trying to get world of warcraft running in compiz and when I try to launch it with wine, it tells me wow couldn't start 3d acceleration
12:40	<deadcats>	to enable the root account, goto System>Administration>Users and Groups and change the root password to whatever you want
12:40	<jcmcbeth>	deserteagle: one
12:40	<soweto76>	zcat[1] , I suppose there are some nasty ones but the ones that I probably need seem to need access via web browser.
12:40	<ardchoille>	deadcats: Please do not tell people how to enable the root account. It's not recommended and makes the system less secure.
12:40	<aftermath>	How do I tar a group of folders each into their own archives?
12:40	<deserteagle>	jcmcbeth: type mount, you should have /dev/hda and /dev/hdb showing up, if so then type sudo mount -t auto /dev/hdc /media/Storage
12:41	<deadcats>	ardchoille, why? do you not believe in having control of your own machine?
12:41	<corevette>	!tar.gz
12:41	<ubotu>	Files with extensions .tar, .gz, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .7z, .ace and other archive file formats can be opened with file-roller (GNOME) or Ark (KDE) - Also see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression
12:41	<kernel06>	avb: i did change verdana 8. looks good for that resolution. do you use in all like desktop font, document font......
12:41	<TheIronChef>	FIEEESTAAA
12:41	<ghostkernel>	people need to know how to change there root password for several reasons
12:41	<ardchoille>	deadcats: If I wanted to hack into your machine, I know you have a root account and I can sit all day and try to brute force it, can't do that if root is disabled.
12:41	<deserteagle>	can someone help me with NVIDIA drivers issues PLEASE?
12:41	<cecko>	Hi all, please help me with Beryl, I have it running but there are no window borders and even some buttons miss
12:41	<aftermath>	most of the time, you can just use sudo -i for everything you need to do
12:41	<aftermath>	I can't think of a case where you'd need root
12:41	<giosva>	ghost: su passwd
12:42	<deadcats>	ardchoille, baloney
12:42	<Hor|zon>	Derek_Russo, just turn off compiz whilst you play? as a more permanent solution you could look into launching it in a new x screen
12:42	<ghostkernel>	giosva,bare with me, im new to ubuntu
12:42	<avb>	kernel06: i use verdana bold  for windows titles, and andale mono for fixed width font
12:42	<ghostkernel>	lol
12:42	<digin4>	so banshee is like rythmbox but better?
12:42	<NobleCOmmerce>	can anyone help,nvtv is segfaulting after a fresh install on 7.04, geforece mx440 using nvidia nonfree drivers
12:42	<Hor|zon>	yup...but less stable
12:42	<Hor|zon>	way less stable
12:42	<digin4>	:)
12:42	<kernel06>	avb: thanks
12:42	<randomwalker>	ardchoille, even so, if people want to be less secure it's up to them
12:43	<digin4>	does ipod work on rythmbox though?
12:43	<avb>	kernel06: u will like andale mono in terminal
12:43	<giosva>	ghost: in the terminal u can type:    su passwd
12:43	<Hor|zon>	digin4: yup
12:43	<carlhempel>	banshee is a C# app ... so if you hate everything from MS .. you may want to steer clear ... jk :)
12:43	<ardchoille>	randomwalker: True, but in this channel it is not recommended, and when in rome..
12:43	<giosva>	and after the return u can type the password
12:43	<selinuxium>	Hi all, I have a broken upgrade one my laptop. There was a power out during the install. TO complicate things further, i do not have a cd rom drive at home as docking station at work but I do have the ISO on the HD.

12:44	<carlhempel>	deserteagle: what's the issue?
12:44	<kitche>	carlhempel: well considering that MS is being sued for their .Net technology anyways but this is offtopic anywho
12:44	<ghostkernel>	yeah i know,but when i had to install jre i had to paste some files located in /opt/ /usr/share/java and i needed to log on as root
12:44	<NobleCOmmerce>	selinuxium, boot from usb?

12:44	<deserteagle>	i cant see your nick, whoever responded
12:44	<carlhempel>	kitche, really? is it about the ECMA stuff ?
12:44	<avb>	selinuxium: u need to boot from somewhere first
12:44	<Tim02>	HEY GUYS,  when I run IWCONFIG it shows my adapter is conected to a network, how to I disconnect it from automaticly connecting to networks!!!\
12:44	<eck>	selinuxium: you can boot off the .iso but it will need to be on another partition
12:44	<aftermath>	How do I exit out of root after sudo-i?
12:44	<deserteagle>	but in any case, im trying to install the nvidia drivers from the restricted drivers but it wont

12:45	<kernel06>	avb: i'm using the same :) thanks
12:45	<Hor|zon>	Tim02: what you're looking for is the auto line for it in /etc/network/interfaces
12:45	<carlhempel>	i think you have you're client set weird
12:45	<avb>	kernel06: np
12:45	<giosva>	gosth: u must modify the login window preferences and enable "allow local system administrator to login"
12:45	<krichie>	www.krichie.extra.hu
12:46	<avb>	selinuxium: so u need just to make package upgrade
12:46	<avb>	selinuxium: right?
12:46	<deserteagle>	tsactuo: ok so i tried installing the restricted-drivers manager one, but it gave horrible colors
12:46	<PurpZeY>	I understand some people have difficulty getting the device drivers to work for wireless cards, would this apply to an on-board wireless card in a laptop?
12:46	<Gunrun>	I would really really appreciate some help with this problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=417548
12:46	<Moosejaw>	geeze...get this...here are my up and down wireless speeds since installing feisty: 187 / 113 whats going on???
12:46	<eck>	PurpZeY: it depends what chipset
12:46	<ffm>	Help!
12:46	<aftermath>	think I can overburn 1GB?
12:46	<ffm>	 My FTP hates me
12:46	<deserteagle>	tsactuo: so i tried installing the ones from the nvidia site, still looked crappy
12:46	<selinuxium>	avb, yes but I have the iso on the HD. I do not have another internet connection at home.
12:46	<shawn34>	lol

12:47	<[ithaycu] >	Wifi works like a champ
12:47	<avb>	selinuxium: mount -o loop /path/to/iso/myiso.iso /cdrom/

12:47	<deserteagle>	tsactuo: all in all, i think it was an issue with the refresh rate
12:47	<ghostkernel>	thanxs eck

12:47	<Moosejaw>	ithaycu what are u using network manager?

12:47	<ghostkernel>	goodbye,debian rocks
12:47	<PurpZeY>	Also, how would I install drivers for a device if I found the proper drivers?
12:47	<carlhempel>	Wireless stuff can be sketchy or it can be wonderful, just depends on the device
12:47	<deserteagle>	carlhempel: was i talking to the wrong person:
12:48	<deserteagle>	?
12:48	<yigal>	ghostkernel: debian is a good distro
12:48	<ffm>	eck: It says connection was reset or somthing. Yes, ports are forwarded.
12:48	<d0lph1nK1ng>	anyone know what driver to install for the ATI TV Wonder Elite tv tuner PCI card?
12:48	<Moosejaw>	carlhempel: it was awesome in edgy, now i dont know whats going on
12:48	<PurpZeY>	I've found on the forums where the driver is located...Says it should be included in the Kernel...How do I actually install them
12:48	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
12:48	<IncredibleHink>	can someone help me copy my home files to a new partition (hdd)...... the harddrive is formatted and mounted
12:48	<IncredibleHink>	i just need help with the cp command
12:48	<deserteagle>	tsactuo: you there?
12:48	<eck>	ffm: probably not corrrectly -- try running sudo nmap -A against the server
12:48	<carlhempel>	deserteagle: are you using Feisty?
12:48	<deserteagle>	yes
12:48	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: what are you trying to copy?
12:48	<biouser>	what up
12:49	<ffm>	eck: What is nmap?
12:49	<eck>	ffm: e.g. sudo nmap -A some.ftp.server.com
12:49	<avb>	selinuxium: first command will mount your iso to /cdrom
12:49	<carlhempel>	ffm: port scanner
12:49	<eck>	ffm: port scanner, you will need to grab it from the repos
12:49	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, /home to /mnt/newhome so that I can put my /home on the new hard drive
12:49	<avb>	selinuxium: second will add it as a source for apt
12:49	<eck>	ffm: it will let you see which ports are being forwarded properly
12:49	<randomwalker>	in my keyboard shortcuts dialog, i see a bunch of hex codes for search, email etc. how do i figure out what keys to press?
12:49	<avb>	selinuxium: and 3rd will update your system
12:49	<ffm>	eck:  sudo: nmap: command not found
12:49	<BlueScreenKid>	hi all ... just install 7.04 feisty for the first time ... but my ati 9600xt card is stuck in 800x600 ... go i need to move back to XGL from AIGLX ? ... thanks in advance ... :D
12:49	<eck>	ffm: yeah, you need to apt-get it first
12:49	<ffm>	also, cant I just run a sheildsup ?
12:49	<carlhempel>	I believe that System->Network Tools has a port scanner, gnome based
12:50	<eck>	what is it?
12:50	<NeoTheOne->	why i got low signal wifi whist chipset atheros at fiesty? Any one have same problem?
12:50	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, from what I understand there are linked files fotlinks harlinks and a bunch of other stuff I don' t know about
12:50	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: while you could use cp -r /home /mnt/home there are safer ways to make sure your home partition is kept intact
12:50	<ffm>	eck: web-based external port scanner
12:50	<velko>	randomwalker, just click with the mouse on the combination you want to change and press the key you want to associate
12:50	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: yes exactly right
12:50	<cox377>	i've just finished installing the new ubuntu, and after about a year of using kubuntu it just feels better, it all seems to work better and smoother
12:50	<Kazol>	What is the Linux equivelent of "My Documents"?
12:50	<eck>	ffm: that's fine, i prefer nmap but all you're doing is checking what ports are going through anyway
12:50	<randomwalker>	velko, yes i know how to create new shortcuts, just trying to find what the existing ones are
12:50	<BlueScreenKid>	Kazol ... /home/%username%
12:50	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/
12:51	<deserteagle>	Kazol: /home/<your username>
12:51	<eck>	Kazol: you just get a home directory, you can organize your files however you like
12:51	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: try that
12:51	<jughead>	Kazol, I guess /home/<yourusername>
12:51	<Kazol>	thx
12:51	<carlhempel>	Kazol, um its just your home folder ... you could make a "Documents" folder in your home folder if you want
12:51	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, ill check it out thanks man!
12:51	<carlhempel>	that;s what I do
12:51	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, actually i just came from there
12:51	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: what was wrong
12:51	<selinuxium>	avb: cheers, it is using the iso for the upgrade, Hopefully I can get past the broken package!
12:51	<hhlp>	hi, fsck is to slow when "cheking file system" in a sdb1 h.d (ata vfat fat32 200gb) every time i connected in bootup, splash desapeers adn i can see text process

12:51	<kernel06>	avb: i couldn't find times new roman in mozilla but i could find arial....i'm thinking to use ie4 do you think it would be better...
12:51	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, nothing is being copied
12:52	<BlueScreenKid>	Kazol ... you gotta realise your playing with a decent operating system .. that is built to let you do what you like .. and not what you are told to do ;)
12:52	<PurpZeY>	How do I install USB Drivers if I know which driver I am supposed to use?
12:52	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, im using the sudo command too
12:52	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: have you mounted your /dev/home ?
12:52	<seth_>	I have a listing in my grub menu.lst file that goes something along the lines of 'title "other drive" / rootnoverify (hd0) / chainloader +1 /boot,' but when I boot grub just does chainloader +1 / boot when I select 'other drive'
12:52	<IncredibleHink>	i mounted my /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/newhome
12:52	<seth_>	What's making it lose a menu entry like that?
12:52	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, i mounted my /dev/sdb1 to /mnt/newhome
12:53	<ffm>	eck: YEs, ftp is OPEN on port 25
12:53	<eck>	ffm: that's smtp, not ftp
12:53	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink: whats wrong with "sudo cp -aR /home /mnt/newhome" ?
12:53	<BlueScreenKid>	tnx seth . you just made me realise i need to edit my menu.lst to my wife can access windoze without any menu choices :))
12:53	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: can you copy anything to /mnt/newhome ?
12:53	<eobanb>	does anyone know if the init scripts in feisty have been finally rewritten to be optimised for upstart?
12:53	<seth_>	BlueScreenKid: haha, you're welcome
12:53	<ffm>	eck: Sorry, wrong port, but 21 is also OPEN.
12:53	<Hor|zon>	eobanb: I don't think they have
12:53	<Kazol>	BlueScreenKid: lol, I understand that. I just wanted to be sure I put it in a formal and common location.
12:54	<Hor|zon>	don't quote me though
12:54	<eck>	ffm: it's _open_, but is your ftp daemon listning on it?
12:54	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: for instance touch foo && sudo cp foo /mnt/newhome/foo ?
12:54	<eobanb>	Hor|zon, hm.  i know they weren't rewritten in 6.10 even though that's when upstart was intro'd
12:54	<AlTheHuman>	I can't get Xvnc working again after upgrading to feisty. Any suggestions?
12:54	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, let me try real quick
12:54	<ffm>	eck:  From locahost, I can ftp://localhost and brows my router.
12:54	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: cool
12:55	<PurpZeY>	How can I control USB Devices if Ubuntu is reading them correctly?
12:55	<eck>	ffm: why does localhost go to your router?
12:55	<yigal>	PurpZeY: read to do what? like lsusb?
12:55	<ffm>	eck: Uhh, it goes to my comp
12:55	<lando__>	Hello
12:55	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, yeah a simple jpg to the /mnt new home copies.... had to sudo it too
12:55	<PurpZeY>	yigal: Well I did lsusb and my device is listed (a quickcam) but I am wondering how I can control it now
12:56	<Morpheus_74>	Is this the Ubuntu room on the freenode server?
12:56	<lando__>	whenever i plug in a usb drive using new feisty install i cant write
12:56	<eck>	ffm: then why does it browse your router?
12:56	<lando__>	only root can write to it
12:56	<Gigi>	Hi!  A moment ago the cube efect when you switch a desktop, was working.  I'm wondering, why now it is not working if it is enabled
12:56	<ffm>	eck: ?
12:56	<kitche>	Morpheus_74: yep irc.ubuntu.com goes to freenode network
12:56	<eck>	ffm: you said ftp://localhost browses your router
12:56	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: so first so you don't have to use sudo you could, "sudo chown -R "username" /mnt/newhome"
12:56	<Kazol>	is anti-virus\spyware protection necessary for Linux? I don't think a 500Mhz processor will handle such a program.
12:56	<ardchoille>	Does't Feisty have a gui specifically for installing codecs?
12:56	<ffm>	eck: No, localhsot browses my FTP.
12:56	<Gigi>	When I click on effect.  All the workspace are decreased to one
12:56	<Moosejaw>	is there a way to NOT use keyring manager with nm-applet?
12:57	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: where "user" is you
12:57	<seth_>	Kazol: As far as I know, there's no reported viruses for Linux, and spyware is pretty damn tough to get
12:57	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, k... done
12:57	<kitche>	Kazol: if your doing windows file server then maybe
12:57	<eck>	ffm: so then 'ftp localhost' should also work
12:57	<randomwalker>	my volume up and volume down keys don't work, because they change the master volume instaed of the headphone volume
12:57	<randomwalker>	how do i fix this?
12:57	<Morpheus_74>	kitche: This is interesting.  I just installed Xchat on my fresh install of Xubuntu, and it brought me to this room!
12:57	<Kazol>	ok
12:57	<yigal>	IncredibleHink:  great now cp a file without sudo and see if it works?
12:57	<lando__>	any1 know why only root has acces to usb drive writing/
12:57	<ffm>	eck: localhost is my computer, ...
12:57	<lando__>	feisty install
12:58	<ffm>	eck: Oooooo.... sorry, I misstyped . I ment computer.
12:58	<ffm>	Sorry
12:58	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, : use -a with cp
12:58	<PurpZeY>	yigal: lsusb is recognizing my USB device, but I have no way of controlling it...It's a webcam, I am looking to see if I can't use it for AIMing....
12:58	<ardchoille>	lando__: Because the mountpoint is owned by root and is 755?
12:58	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: in fact you are getting permission denied in your ~ directory when you use find ? yes?
12:58	<BlueScreenKid>	am i the only one who find it annoying to have to so a sudo passwd root everytime i install ubuntu to make life easier ?
12:58	<lando__>	ardchoille: how can i change that?
12:58	<ardchoille>	lando__: use sudo ?
12:58	<Hor|zon>	BlueScreenKid, don't do that...unless you have to
12:58	<spikeb>	eventually you'll quit giving root a password and use sudo
12:58	<eck>	ffm: what about 'ftp localhost' ?
12:59	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: if this is the case you want to do the same chown command as above but on your home directory , "~"
12:59	<forQed>	Anyone have any idea when Pidgin (the re-named gaim project) will finally have a release?
12:59	<BlueScreenKid>	Hor|zon .. any reason why ? or have i lived in the dark ages to long :))
12:59	<grupis>	hello! I need help installing Feisty from Usb stick.
12:59	<IncredibleHink>	the cp -a worked
12:59	<Hor|zon>	dark ages, definitely
12:59	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, the cp - aworked
12:59	<eck>	forQed: i think the plan is soon, but of course it will probably not be in the repositories until gutsy
12:59	<Hor|zon>	:P
12:59	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
12:59	<grupis>	I'm following this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
12:59	<BlueScreenKid>	Hor|zon .. what are the benifits of not switching to root .. sorry i come from the debian age :)
01:00	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, i need to chown my home directory? Couldn't i just use sudo to keep that security intact?
01:00	<ardchoille>	BlueScreenKid: Do you have any idea how difficult it is to brute force a root account that is disabled?
01:00	<ffm>	eck: I know that ftp://localhost works on my computer to FTP to my computer. It doe s NOT go to my router.
01:00	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, my /home/<username>	directory is already -R'd obviously
01:00	<ffm>	that is 192.168.1.41
01:00	<Moosejaw>	man feisty screwed up my connection speeds
01:00	<Moosejaw>	geeze
01:00	<Moosejaw>	so lame.
01:00	<ffm>	192.168.1.1
01:00	<Morpheus_74>	I just did a fresh install of Xubuntu fiesty, and I'm having some issues with my display.  II set the Horiz and Vert  in xorg, but I I cannot get the refresh  rate to 85.  Any ideas?
01:00	<BlueScreenKid>	ard .. yes .. but i also now how much of a pain it is to have to do a sudo ... ;)
01:00	<Kazol>	I have a problem installing Limewire. When I follow these directions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=95793 , I cannot create a blank text file; I tried both the command and doing it manually.
01:00	<idefixx>	ffm: Are you trying to connect from one computer on your local network to another - one being the client the other one running the ftp server? if so why do you need to forward a port?
01:00	<eck>	ffm: i'm confused about what you are trying to do then
01:00	<ffm>	Morpheus_74: Go to #xubuntu, please
01:00	<BlueScreenKid>	ard .. but i get your point :D
01:00	<randomwalker>	does anyone know how to make volume keys change the headphone volume instead of master?
01:00	<ardchoille>	BlueScreenKid: Typing 4 extra chars is a pain?!?
01:00	<Hor|zon>	BlueScreenKid, well there's no reason you can't use root really if you completely trust yourself and disable root logins
01:00	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: you want to own your entire home directory, unless you have set it up differently, not obvisously when you build something or use sudo the ownership changes
01:00	<kitche>	BlueScreenKid: jsut sudo -i :)
01:01	<ardchoille>	Vluid_: :)
01:01	<ardchoille>	BlueScreenKid: :)
01:01	<BlueScreenKid>	sudo -i ? .. sorry i haven't come across that yet ?
01:01	<Hor|zon>	or rather, just don't login as root
01:01	<eck>	BlueScreenKid: it runs an interactive root shell
01:01	<ffm>	idefixx: eck :  I am trying to connect to myself from an external source, like being able to ftp MYIP
01:01	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, i have two users in my home directory, me and my wife
01:01	<eck>	i.e. a login shell
01:01	<BlueScreenKid>	eck .. ok thanks for that one i have learnt something :D .. cheers
01:01	<Kazol>	I cannot create a blank txt file using the cmd: sudo cp peerguardian.sh /usr/local/bin
01:01	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: not /home but /home/"user"
01:02	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: ~
01:02	<ffm>	idefixx: I own the domain intserverror.com
01:02	<ffm>	eck: I own the domain intserverror.com
01:02	<idefixx>	ffm: in that case im confused too :)
01:02	<Kazol>	I get the error msg: cp: cannot stat `peerguardian.sh': No such file or directory
01:02	<kitche>	Kazol: touch is used to create a blank txt file
01:02	<ffm>	idefixx: I want to be able to connect from OUTSIDE my network. but i _cant_
01:02	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: do you have http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/ open ?
01:02	<eolo__>	set irc_nick1 eolo999
01:02	<idefixx>	ffm: yes i understand i just wanted to be sure that was really the issue here
01:02	<kitche>	Kazol: sudo touch /usr/local/bin/peerguardian.sh
01:02	<eck>	ffm: then you need to be connecting to intserverror.com not localhost
01:03	<a8514>	Bye
01:03	<ffm>	like, although I can http://intserverror.com:8080 , i cannot ftp://intserverror.com
01:03	<billy>	what port does the BiTorrent tracker use?
01:03	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, yes
01:03	<ffm>	eck like, although I can http://intserverror.com:8080 , i cannot ftp://intserverror.com
01:03	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, /home/user is chowned
01:03	<ffm>	idefixx:  like, although I can http://intserverror.com:8080 , i cannot ftp://intserverror.com
01:03	<Kazol>	kitche: Thanks! The article had the wrong cmd then.
01:03	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, that's what the sudo cp -aR was for , it preserves permissions
01:03	<LabThug>	<insert appropriate time of day>
01:03	<kitche>	ffm: do you have a ftp daemon running
01:03	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: let us try  just the find command to see what type of files you might be having problems with "
01:03	<yigal>	"find . -depth -print0 "
01:03	<darnell>	why the hell cant i change the ports for my email in evolution?
01:04	<Hor|zon>	you can
01:04	<idefixx>	ffm: your port is open.. i can connect it
01:04	<kitche>	Kazol: probably right command but you probably didn't have the peerguardian.sh file int he directory you did sudo cp in
01:04	<darnell>	where?
01:04	<Hor|zon>	darnell, in the address part do smtp.domain.com:port
01:04	<BlueScreenKid>	so can anyone help me with my ati 9600xt resolution stuck at 800x600 ... i never had this problem on edgy ... only now for the first time on feisty
01:04	<ffm>	kitche: Yes.
01:04	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: are you getting permission denied?
01:04	<eck>	ffm: i can also connect to it -- it looks like it is working
01:04	<ffm>	idefixx: You can? Why cant i?
01:04	<idefixx>	ffm: just tired it with telnet (vsFTPd 2.0.5)
01:04	<yigal>	excuse me we have to put a filter on the above
01:04	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, let me try
01:04	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, on the home directory right?
01:04	<eck>	ffm: what command are you using to connect?
01:05	<yigal>	find . -depth -print0 | grep -i permission
01:05	<atlantia>	!nvidia
01:05	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
01:05	<ffm>	eck: FireFox ftp://user:pass@server
01:05	<LabThug>	ok, I have a GeForce2 card in this machine and was trying to get beryl working.  At some point I was told to install 'nvidia-glx-legacy' due to my card's age, so I did.  Now I get "NVRM: API mismatch" messages everytime I respawn X.  How do I fix?
01:05	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: yes
01:05	<underwatercow>	can someone tell me why I can't get Gparted to use the space before the partition? it only sees the space after.
01:05	<BlueScreenKid>	ubotu was that meant for me ?
01:05	<idefixx>	ffm: im guessing it has something to do with ur internal network do 'nslookup intserverror.com' what is the ip it resolves to?
01:05	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: if you & your wife are using /home you will have to use sudo
01:05	<eck>	ffm: try running the ftp command, i.e. 'ftp intserverror.com'
01:05	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: but it should work
01:05	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, from the /home directory i did this and recieved no errors  .........       sudo cp -aR . /mnt/newhome
01:06	<obz>	hello. I'm hoping someone can help... since upgrading to Fiesty my Internet is dead. I can't connect to anything, including my gateway. I have the same settings as before the upgarde which worked fine. any suggestions?
01:06	<ffm>	idefixx: My computer. intserverror.com:8080 works...
01:06	<kitche>	ffm: is the server near you or hosted someplace else your dns might not be resolving to the right ip yet
01:06	<ffm>	eck: That works
01:06	<voidmage>	Anyone know what I  can use to get the time in a shell?
01:06	<darnell>	my email wont send, i can receive but not send
01:06	<ffm>	kitche: My server is my own computer.
01:06	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: thats awesome, so thats it
01:06	<eck>	ffm: then everything is working
01:06	<darnell>	i've never had this problem before,
01:06	<ffm>	kitche: I can acces ftp, just not in FF
01:06	<BlueScreenKid>	voidmage ... date should do
01:06	<eck>	ffm: try it without the pass
01:06	<eck>	ffm: firefox will prompt you
01:06	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, did it preserver all the special softlinks etc?
01:06	<grupis>	I trying to mount a vfat usb stick in a shell of alternate cd installation (feisty) but the kernel seems to lack vfat module. what can I do?
01:06	<ffm>	eck: I get same issue both times
01:06	<underwatercow>	should gparted be able to resize into the space before a partition?
01:07	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: I don't think so
01:07	<kitche>	ffm: here is the guess does it know that it's that domain>? since my server is called hosting.kitchetech.com but the domain is kitchetech.com
01:07	<voidmage>	blue: thanks
01:07	<eck>	ffm: well whatever the problem is, it is a firefox issue, not an issue with your ftp daemon
01:07	<voidmage>	BlueScreenKid: even
01:07	<ffm>	eck: Ok.
01:07	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, k... how do we do that
01:07	<yigal>	  IncredibleHink:  unfortunately
01:07	<BlueScreenKid>	voidmage : your welcome

I will just go and buy that.
01:08	<PurpZeY>	Can someone direct me as to why my printer won't print a test-page? I installed the drivers, Ubuntu picked up the printer as directly-connected, but now I am unable to print anything.

01:11	<underwatercow>	I used to use it
01:11	<underwatercow>	peerguardian that is
01:11	<ffm>	Morpheus_74: Yes. Ubuntu = GNOME, Xubuntu = XFCE

01:12	<lmosher>	I'm running the 2.6.20-15-generic
01:12	<atlantia>	!nvidia
01:12	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
01:12	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, yes
01:12	<radar1976>	iain might not get a quick answer
01:12	<idefixx>	Rodya|Laptop: the update process asked me if I wanted to restart - so you should be able to keep using the 'old/new' system even though i wouldnt advise this.
01:12	<killerKlown>	i'm running 7.04 2.6.20-15-generic
01:12	<iain>	i'm getting an intermittent error on hybernation resume.
01:12	<iain>	It's fixed by rebooting the system
01:12	<iain>	well I've got it now
01:12	<iain>	but would rather not reboot
01:12	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
01:12	<yigal>	 IncredibleHink: good, so well I think it should work now, cross fingers
01:12	<iain>	does anyone know how to reboot the sound module? eg from consol
01:12	<underwatercow>	Does anyone know why Gparted won't let me resize into space before the partition?
01:12	<Kazol>	underwatercow: Does the default installation block all ranges of IPs? Just curious, why did you uninstall it? Is there a better program?
01:13	<darnell>	ok so this mail thing is obviously not a problem with my isp..
01:13	<iain>	I've tried using modprobe -r but I'm being told the module is in use
01:13	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to remove all traces of a program that i installed from a binary (.bin)? it doesnt show up in synaptic, i installed it in a folder in /usr/lib/. do i just delete the folder that i installed it to?
01:13	<darnell>	i used a different one and the same thing is happening
01:13	<darnell>	whats going on with evolution?
01:13	<Rodya|Laptop>	idefixx, i'm asking if the download process works the same as in synaptic, if a download gets messed up, can it be restarted later?
01:13	<what_if>	how large should a ubuntu /boot partition be ??
01:13	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, negative
01:13	<obz>	anyone have a minute to look at a networking problem? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414550
01:13	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, the only errors i see too are the ones from my wifes username
01:13	<sid>	iain: alsaconf ?
01:13	<maek>	randomwalker: thanks
01:14	<Ademan>	anyone know how to change the gtk+ theme from IceWM?
01:14	<randomwalker>	darnell, its totally going on, don't listen to the creationists
01:14	<underwatercow>	Kazol: to my knowledge It blocks ranges known to be used for certain purposes. I don't use it lately because I switched to Ubuntu and haven't bothered trying to get it again as it never seemed to do anything but be in the way anyway
01:14	<iain>	sid>	no such command over here....
01:14	<darnell>	fuck off.
01:14	<underwatercow>	so no one in here knows how to partition a hard drive? sad...
01:14	<IndyGunFreak>	darnell: ?..lol

=== wildschwein is now known as zoetrope666
01:14	<idefixx>	Rodya|Laptop: yes, but the updater starts installing the downloaded packages immediately once its finished
01:14	<eck>	Tarkus: delete that folder, and if you really want to get everything try to look at the shell script and see if it installed any files to other places (e.g. /etc)
01:14	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: what you could do, if you are not too uncomfortable with this is chown everything under your name for the copy and then chown her name back to her ~ directory when the copy is done
01:14	<Shaba1>	hello how do I adjust the time to start the default OS on grub?
01:14	<darnell>	yeah
01:14	<iain>	i've played with the alsamixer though and through the gui doesn't make a difference
01:15	<iain>	module needs to reload I think.
01:15	<iain>	for whatever reason
01:15	<eck>	Shaba1: it is the timeout option in the menu.lst file
01:15	<njal>	Can anyone help me get the rt73 driver working
01:15	<njal>	the Wiki DOESN'T work
01:15	<Rodya|Laptop>	idefixx, so it downloads package A, installs package A, downloads package B, installs package B, etc... instead of downloading A,B,...,Z then installing A,B,...Z?
01:15	<yigal>	 IncredibleHink: however this could be dangerous, and I am not sure about the home directory like soft links going to her home could now go to your home etc..?  but everything should be intact
01:15	<iain>	i thought there might be an /etc/init.d/alsa restart command or something
01:15	<stas>	on dapper drake I used to be able to log in as root with a regular GUI session, I upgraded to Fiery and now it won't let me log in as root.  Basically I need a graphical file manager with root privileges.
01:15	<Tarkus>	eck: alright, would deleting the folder also get rid of the launcher in my applications menu?
01:15	<darnell>	there is a problem ok..
01:16	<iain>	or a way to overide the 'this module is in use'
01:16	<iain>	with modprobe -r soundcore
01:16	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: don't do that
01:16	<wallydalla1>	partition a hard drive   easy.    download a cd image called  gparted    boot from that cd.   follow the GUI menus
01:16	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: found the answer !!
01:16	<darnell>	i cant send email, it just sits there saying sending message.
01:16	<ClayPigeon>	Toshiba Laptop M30 604. First time Linux OS (for me) and everything works. :) Thanks for a great OS!!!
01:16	<idefixx>	Rodya|Laptop: ahh sry, i just got what you mean... no it downloads them all then installs them - if internet connection fails u can resume.
01:16	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, whats that
01:16	<Rodya|Laptop>	alright, thanks idefixx
01:16	<kitche>	darnell: is this on a custom email server or though your ISP?
01:16	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: you have to use find . -depth -print0 | sudo cpio null sparse -pvd /mnt/newhome/
01:16	<eck>	Tarkus: I think there is a .desktop file for that, or something of that nature. Try running something like: find / -iname "*some_search_string*"
01:16	<njal>	stas: sudo nautilus
01:16	<yigal>	sudo cpio, so obvious
01:16	<darnell>	i have one email addy from earthlink..
01:16	<darnell>	another through godaddy for my own domain
01:16	<darnell>	neither work
01:16	<stas>	thanks
01:16	<stas>	I am new
01:16	<eck>	Tarkus: then scan the list of files that are found and delete the ones that seem to be associated with the application
01:16	<darnell>	receiving, yes
01:17	<darnell>	sending doesnt
01:17	<dts>	I just finished my upgrade and Sound stopped working, how do i know the system sees the card?
01:17	<darnell>	connection times out after 10 minutes or so
01:17	<IndyGunFreak>	darnell: then you probably haven't set it up correctly
01:17	<yigal>	you are using your permissions on the copy so you will get permission denied etc.
01:17	<kitche>	darnell: well for your domain maybe sendmail is not configured correctly
01:17	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, you're the man, man!!
01:17	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, thanks
01:17	<yigal>	thanks man!
01:17	<lmosher>	I have a T2500 processor and just installed feisty. I'm trying to get frequency scaling to work, but both the panel applet and powersaved say scaling is not supported. Any suggestions?
01:17	<darnell>	i've had these emails for a long time
01:17	<jamesm>	anyone here know how to extract passwords from /etc/passwords
01:17	<darnell>	they always work.
01:17	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
01:17	<underwatercow>	eck: are you familiar with partitioning and gparted?
01:17	<darnell>	now, they dont
01:17	<IndyGunFreak>	lol
01:17	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: thanks man!
01:17	<darnell>	its not being configured improperly, its just not working
01:17	<eck>	underwatercow: i think so
01:17	<iain>	no1 any idea? :-/
01:18	<Ademan>	jamesm: as far as i know you have to brute force it, since passwords are hashed
01:18	<Tarkus>	eck: alright, thanks
01:18	<randomwalker>	jamesm, man shadow
01:18	<Gigi>	Why when I select cube effect, all my work spaces disappear and appears only 1
01:18	<yigal>	IncredibleHink:  to me if that works?
01:18	<iain>	*rubs his eyes and looks upset
01:18	<darnell>	what is another good email client
01:18	<jamesm>	ty
01:18	<iain>	pretty please?
01:18	<underwatercow>	eck: do you know why gparted can't resize into the free space before the partition? it only resizes into free space that follows.
01:18	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: s/to/tell
01:18	<wallydalla1>	what is the rt73 driver?  network card?
01:18	<Ademan>	darnell: what are you using? i recomend evolution
01:18	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, like a charm
01:18	<iain>	whoever answers can use my sister?
01:18	<darnell>	i use evolution
01:18	<Ademan>	darnell: it works fine with my earthlink account, and my gmail account
01:18	<eck>	underwatercow: I believe it is a limitation of the filesystem, afaik there aren't any that you can resize from the "left"
01:19	<darnell>	the guys at earthlink told me that the ports are 25 and 587
01:19	<darnell>	no idea what 587 is
01:19	<eck>	underwatercow: for some filesystems you can snapshot them and then move them, but it is a bit of work
01:19	<sartan>	Still no native WPA support in the 7.04 huh.. I'm dissapointed.... (IPW2200)
01:19	<Ademan>	darnell: you might try thunderbird if you don't like evolution
01:19	<lmosher>	I have an intel T2500 and cpu frequency scaling is apparently disabled. How do I fix this?
01:19	<yigal>	darnell: smtp?
01:19	<darnell>	yes
01:19	<darnell>	the pop3 is fine
01:19	<ajehuk>	darnell - the correct client smtp port
01:19	<yigal>	darnell: google uses 587
01:19	<wallydalla1>	can anyone help me with installing a wireless card in my 6.06 computer?
01:19	<yigal>	darnell?
01:19	<underwatercow>	eck: so what do I do if I make a leading parition too small and need to resize? I won't be able to pull it from the next partition, will I?
01:19	<darnell>	ok, so i need port 25
01:19	<eck>	darnell: if you look at /etc/services it lists what services are associated with what ports
01:19	<obz>	sigh.
01:19	<Hor|zon>	iain: sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
01:20	<GenNMX>	lmosher: That's an issue for your BIOS. Hit F1, DELETE, ESC, F2, etc. to enter your BIOS immediatly after turning on your computer.
01:20	<lmosher>	GenNMX, Promise you it isn't. Works great in XP.
01:20	<Gunrun>	its normally delete
01:20	<PurpZeY>	Is there some reason my printer won't print a test page? Ubuntu shows it as recognized, and recognized as a proper device but it won't actually print anything.
01:20	<IceGuest_7>	anyone have a link to tutorial to drop gnome and add kde?  I don't feel like installing kubuntu just to get kde
01:20	<darnell>	25 is for mail
01:20	<wallydalla1>	BIOS setup can be   DEL key,  or f2   or F10
01:20	<lando__>	whats the name of the admins group
01:20	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
01:20	<lando__>	so i can add myself through the terminal
01:21	<ajehuk>	darnell - both are mail
01:21	<eck>	underwatercow: no, unfortunately not. If you were using lvm you could add more space, but ifyou are just doing a regular non-lvm setup you need to do it manually (i.e. back up everything, resize, restore everything)
01:21	<BlueScreenKid>	yuckity ... yuckity .. yuck ... to get my ati 9600xt to work properly i had to use non-open source drivers ... where on edgy i could use open source .. why this backwards step :(
01:21	<GenNMX>	I'd had plenty of motherboards with the BIOS as F1, it's up to the firmware manufacturer....
01:21	<wallydalla1>	I have read all the madwi documentation.
01:21	<Ademan>	anyone know how to set the gtk+ theme white you're using a different window manager? (such as iceWM or fluxbox)
01:21	<darnell>	right, but why wont it send
01:21	<underwatercow>	eck: that sucks, lol... thanks though... think 30Gib is enough for /?
01:21	<darnell>	its set correctly
01:21	<BlueScreenKid>	IceGuest ... install kunbuntu .. instead of ubuntu
01:21	<eck>	Ademan: I believe it is done by setting it in your .gtkrc
01:21	<ajehuk>	darnell - what is happening?
01:21	<GenNMX>	lmosher: Do you mean dynamic switching?
01:21	<eck>	underwatercow: that's plenty
01:21	<darnell>	earthlink tried to tell me that they dont support linux..
01:21	<Ademan>	eck: thanks, i'll try that
01:21	<Hor|zon>	underwatercow: if you have other partitions for music etc. then 15gb is enough

01:22	<d0lph1nK1ng>	anyone know which driver to install to get an ATI TV Wonder Elite tv tuner card working?
01:22	<darnell>	well, i can receive emails, but when i'm sending..
01:22	<eck>	underwatercow: I have 7.7 :-\
01:22	<darnell>	it just sits there.. and finally it times out
01:22	<iain>	oh dear .............
01:22	<ajehuk>	darnell - should make no difference if they do or not
01:22	<arooni>	how easy is it to upgrade to feisty from edgy ?
01:22	<wallydalla1>	6.06 shows me that madwifi is installed,  but the wifi card I purchased seems to be too new.  it is a new 802.11 G card  made in 2006
01:22	<IceGuest_7>	BlueScreenKid I'm running ubuntu server with my teamspeak server atm, plus webserver I dont wanna do a backup and resintall = (
01:22	<darnell>	i know
01:22	<darnell>	thats what i told them..
01:22	<ajehuk>	darnell - whats the problem?
01:22	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: I am making a home partition too
01:22	<Hor|zon>	iain, did you sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart ?
01:22	<iain>	i managed to restart alsa now (thanks to horijzon!) but it hasn't helped. I still ahve no sound.
01:22	<BlueScreenKid>	d0lph1nK1ng : i had to install a binary ati version just now to get my 9600xt to work .. don't know if this info might help ?
01:22	<darnell>	holdon..
01:22	<ajehuk>	iain - have you run alsaconf?
01:22	<Hor|zon>	lol underwatercow, then 10gigs should do...
01:22	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, how do i make it mount on every bootup now?
01:22	<darnell>	im going to delete the account and reenter it
01:23	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, i understand i have to edit the /etc/fstab file
01:23	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, but what do i put in it
01:23	<underwatercow>	Hor|zon: isn't it a good principle to leave half of the root/operating system free?
01:23	<darnell>	ok..
01:23	<d0lph1nK1ng>	BlueScreenKid, no it doesn't.  thanks, tho
01:23	<ajehuk>	iain (sudo alsaconf)
01:23	<darkram>	In 7.04 desktop effects is actually Compiz?
01:23	<darnell>	earthlinks pop3 is mail.earthlink.net
01:23	<errorlevel>	So...  Here I am, connected to IRC, obviously connected to the internet.  I click the "Upgrade" button in the Update Manager, and I get a dialog telling me "could not download the release notes, please check your internet connection."  Is this a known issue?  If it matters, I am using the United States server, and it should be able to connect since I just installed a package from it successfully, and I updated my package listing from it too.
01:23	<lando__>	when i run users i see 2 lando
01:23	<arooni>	hey folks... how should i upgrade to feisty from edgy?
01:23	<idefixx>	darnell: sad but true
01:23	<randomwalker>	darkram: yeah
01:23	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, just change the /etc/fstab line for /home to use /dev/sdb
01:23	<eck>	underwatercow: if the FS gets too full you will get fragmentation
01:23	<darnell>	username is darnell@earthlink.net
01:23	<darkram>	thanks
01:24	<Hor|zon>	and create a new line for the old partition if you want to use that for something else
01:24	<darnell>	for authentication do i need password or login?
01:24	<idefixx>	darnell: that wasnt for you
01:24	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: do programs install to the root partition typically?
01:24	<dts>	where would error logs for sound be?
01:24	<Gigi>	I'm changing configurations on Beryl  but I do not see no difference.  Why?
01:24	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, there is not one for home
01:24	<BlueScreenKid>	i'm gonna unplug my scanner .. it is making weird noise .. and i never use it .. lol
01:24	<locolbd>	arooni:
01:24	<yigal>	 IncredibleHink: I am not so good with fstab, you should use a udev id that you create, someone in here should know, but I am not sure exactly, you can always use /dev/sdb1 /home but udev is a better way to go so get some one who knows how to do it with udev
01:24	<Furthur>	arooni : http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
01:24	<Hor|zon>	underwatercow: they do unless you tell them not to, and the settings are stored on /home
01:24	<arooni>	logicecx: ok
01:24	<eck>	underwatercow: most of the files go in /usr, a few files go in other places. /var is where you would hold files that might change, so usually that would be email, a website, ftp, etc.
01:24	<Dimicus>	Anyone know any software that can help to make integrated software better ? i have the problem that i can only have 1 sound device on at the time. i use a integrated realtek sound card.
01:25	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, thx... ill ask around
01:25	<locolbd>	arooni: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
01:25	<eck>	underwatercow: apt also stores a bunch of stuff in /var you can clean out
01:25	<iain>	ajehuk>	 i don't have that command I don't think. As in it doesn't show up when pressing tab to saee available commands
01:25	<IncredibleHink>	Can someone help me have a partition get mounted on every bootup"?
01:25	<eck>	underwatercow: try du -sh /var/cache
01:25	<idefixx>	Gigi: have u selected the beryl window manager or are you still using metacity?
01:25	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, I can help with the udev rule, but is the drive going to be in that hot swap bay?
01:25	<rio>	where do i set up multiple displays?
01:25	<darnell>	ok, same thing
01:25	<Stormx2>	IncredibleHink: file system?
01:25	<Tarkus>	how do i remove a directory in a terminal? when i run "sudo rmdir *directory name*" it says "Directory not empty". i know its not empty, i want to remove everything in it. any ideas?
01:25	<Hor|zon>	if it is then yes you need the udev rule
01:25	<Gigi>	idefixx how do I know that?
01:25	<Stormx2>	Tarkus: rm -rf directoryname (use with care)
01:25	<ajehuk>	iain - you need to run it as root (sudo alsaconf), depending on your config users cannot normally see commands that only root can run
01:25	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, i ahvent got the hotswap bay yet,..... i just got my /home copied to the new internal
01:26	<BlueScreenKid>	IncredibleHink : sorry . missed what you asked before .. what partition is it ?
01:26	<eck>	underwatercow: nearly all the space reported by that command can be freed up by running apt-get clean
01:26	<arooni>	are there any apps that will be broken if i upgrade to feisty?
01:26	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, then you don't need the udev rule I wouldn't think...it should stay the same
01:26	<idefixx>	Gigi: do you have the beryl icon in your tray? the gem thingy next to the clock?
01:26	<Tarkus>	Stormx2: thanks
01:26	<IncredibleHink>	BlueScreenKid, /dev/sdb1
01:26	<billy>	what port does BitTorrent need to connect to peers?
01:26	<iain>	ajehun>	(nope already tried that)....sudo: alsaconf: command not found
01:26	<locolbd>	!wireless
01:26	<Stormx2>	arooni: Only ones you may have installed from alternate repos / .debs
01:26	<BlueScreenKid>	is that an actual scsi device or a USB one ?
01:26	<eck>	billy: it is configured in your client
01:26	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
01:26	<Gigi>	idefixx no next to the clock I do have the volume and then internet and then normal software such gaim.  How do I do that?
01:26	<eck>	billy: i.e. you can use any ports whatsoever
01:27	<Tarkus>	Stormx2: is it "rm -rf" or "rmdir irf"?
01:27	<ajehuk>	iain if you dont have it try installing the alsa-utils
01:27	<Stormx2>	Tarkus: rm
01:27	<arooni>	Stormx2: is there a way of knowing which ones those are
01:27	<rio>	installed a video card with svideo output.  how do i set it up to display to the tv?... i figured in under system... but cant find it
01:27	<Tarkus>	Stormx2: k
01:27	<billy>	eck, i've got outbound policy set for BitTorrent.  but can't connect to peers.
01:27	<Stormx2>	arooni: I'm not really sure >.< sorry
01:27	<seth_>	true
01:27	<seth_>	whoops, miss tell
01:27	<iain>	ajehuk>	returns 'already newest version'
01:27	<idefixx>	Gigi: Go to System Tool in the menu and start the beryl-manager.
01:27	<arooni>	does beryl work in feisty?
01:27	<ajehuk>	iain - let me just check again...
01:27	<iain>	ajehuk>	and I restarted it a few minutes ago so it's definately there and running
01:27	<eck>	billy: it is best not to use the ones in the 6881-6999 range since those are the "default" ports used by mainline andblocked by some ISPs
01:27	<idefixx>	arooni: yes
01:28	<seth_>	I have a listing in my grub menu.lst file that goes something along the lines of 'title "other drive" / rootnoverify (hd0) / chainloader +1 /boot,' but when I boot grub just does chainloader +1 / boot when I select 'other drive'. What's making it lose the rootnoverify command?
01:28	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: What do you guys do about storing documents and music, etc... do you put them in home? it kind of bothers me not having control of other things being saved there
01:28	<billy>	eck, thanks for that advise.
01:28	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points.

01:28	<BlueScreenKid>	and can someone answer me why my hdxx is being picked up as sdxx ??? this doesn't make any sense
01:28	<wallydalla1>	is there a URL with a simple FAQ on this UBUNTU chat.  I'm using GAIM on an ubunut box
01:28	<arooni>	does feisty help at all with my sony laptop... or laptops in general (trackpad issues, etc...)
01:28	<Hor|zon>	underwatercow, I create another seperate data partition for that
01:28	<lando__>	i took away my own permission to access administrationi settings :(
01:28	<lando__>	how do i get them back?
01:28	<Otrayo>	anyone else getting this error when trying to upgrade to feisty: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-security/restricted/binary-i386/Packages.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
01:28	<ajehuk>	iain - just check that alsa-base is intalled can you?
01:28	<eck>	underwatercow: I have another partition called /data, and I have most of my document folders in /home symlinked to the actual folders in /data
01:28	<HymnToLife`>	BlueScreenKid, because they changed the way hard drives are handled, no big deal
01:28	<Morpheus_74>	How can I change my refresh rate to 85Hz, when this option is not listed in the GUI?
01:28	<ardchoille>	Does't Feisty have a gui specifically for installing codecs?
01:29	<zach>	is anyone having trouble with sound in 7.04? i only get sound from the center channel of my 5.1 and its 10% music 90% static
01:29	<randomwalker>	lando__: what exactly did you do?
01:29	<errorlevel>	Otrayo: I just plain can't even get the upgrade to start.  It says I have no internet connection. (Though I'm on IRC, fancy that.)
01:29	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: I'm a bit of an organiztion nazi and having random stuff appearing in my oranized files is annoying... that's a good idea eck. I'm still not used to the fact that I can use symlinks, lol
01:29	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, im guessing i need something similar to this? /dev/hda5 /home ext3 nodev,nosuid 0 2
01:29	<yigal>	BlueScreenKid: and can someone answer me why my hdxx is being picked up as sdxx ??? this doesn't make any sense SATA STACK
01:29	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  It is the configurations... and now?
01:29	<Shaba1>	Is a symlnk the same as a shortcut ni windwos?
01:29	<iain>	ajehuk>	'alsa base is already the newest version'
01:29	<BlueScreenKid>	hymm ... wel it is to me .. i was thinking .. hmm ... suddenly my PC has become sentiant .. and install a scsi array i was not aware of .. LMAO !!!
01:29	<Hor|zon>	eck, to be on the safe side I use /home/data so there's no change of typos
01:29	<Otrayo>	errorlevel: haha...seems like the upgrade tool isn't perfect yet
01:29	<Hor|zon>	chance*
01:29	<eck>	underwatercow: so actually i don't have /home on another partition... the reason I do this is so I can boot into another distro or install and still access all my documents and have the freedom to use different configs for all my apps
01:29	<NobleCOmmerce>	anyone have experience with NVTV?
01:29	<BlueScreenKid>	yigal .. i am not even using SATA .. but normal ATA ;)
01:29	<lando__>	i ran this command
01:29	<lando__>	sudo usermod -G plugdev lando
01:29	<DanZ3>	I just burned the feisty cd and when i press install or check cd for defects, I get "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"
01:30	<lando__>	it gave me that access but took away all others
01:30	<idefixx>	Gigi: if you started the Beryl Manager there should be the try icon i was talking about.
01:30	<eck>	underwatercow: but it is basically the same in principle as having a separate /home partition
01:30	<iain>	ajehuk>	sound works fine except in a quirky way when hybernate is resumed. Even then only intermittently (think it depends whether it was playing something when it goes into hybernate but not yet sure)...so the sound setup I've got *does* work.....
01:30	<yigal>	BlueScreenKid: yes the entire filesystem is using SATA nomenclature now
01:30	<TomTheGeek>	Hey guys, anyone want to help me with trying to install ubuntu on  a fake raid 1?
01:30	<iain>	ajehuk>	and restarting fixes it.
01:30	<BlueScreenKid>	yigal . ok tnx
01:30	<underwatercow>	eck: yeah, that was my next question... I was going to make home the rest of the drive.. .but if i store files on another drive, that would be pointless
01:30	<Gigi>	idefixx nop...
01:30	<idefixx>	Gigi: If you do not have the beryl manager. do 'sudo apt-get install beryl-manager'
01:30	<wallydalla1>	tomthegeek, what is fake raid 1
01:30	<darnell>	see.
01:30	<Beastage>	ah
01:30	<darnell>	my email works with thunderbird..
01:30	<Beastage>	cool
01:30	<iain>	ajehuk>	I'm trying to figure out how to reload all the necessary modules and things without restarting to see if I can fix the problem without saving everything and closing every window I've got open.
01:30	<lando__>	now i cant even sudo in terminal it never asks me for password
01:31	<darnell>	evolution has a problem
01:31	<TomTheGeek>	it's software based raid 1
=== nibsa1242 is now known as nibsa1242b
01:31	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, is this for the new home partition?
01:31	<Beastage>	U 7.04 >	U 6.10
01:31	<dimeotane>	anyone have truecrypt working under fesity?
01:31	<underwatercow>	eck: so 20GiB for root and home should be plenty for everything I'll ever want to install?
01:31	<yigal>	darnell: yes evolution has always had problem(s)
01:31	<randomwalker>	lando__: i guess you could manually add yourself in /etc/groups to all the groups you want
01:31	<cwmoser>	Feisty Fawn - how do you "Upgrade" rather than overwrite my existing Ubuntu 6.10??
01:31	<darnell>	with sending mail?
01:31	<ajehuk>	iain - oh right - sorry, so all you are after is a restart of the sound system after hibernate... /etc/init.d/alsa reload should do that...
01:31	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, right
01:31	<randomwalker>	lando__: but other than that i dunno
01:31	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, it should be the same as the old one except for the device name
01:31	<zach>	hey can someone give me a hand with my sound in 7.04?
01:31	<darnell>	interesting, since its an email proggy
01:31	<iain>	ajehuk>	I'm not sure th ere's anything 'missing' per say.
01:31	<LiENUS>	what package do i need under ubuntu to compile znc with openssl support?
01:31	<vik>	if I want to get an image (using dd) of an LVM volume, which device should I use?
01:31	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, im trying to figure out what all the options mean and the two nubmers at the end
01:31	<Gigi>	idefixx I have the beryl manager, I can see "Beryl Setting Manager"  but I open it and I can change configs, but I do not see the difference and neither the icon
01:32	<yigal>	cwmoser: just make another partitition and install Fiesty on it
01:32	<jeef>	i had two soundcards on this machine and now i'm trying to use a specific one of them... (both are still available it seems).. how can i change which soundcard is primary?
01:32	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, there is no old one... everything was on a single partition
01:32	<idefixx>	Gigi: Setting Manager and Beryl Manager are two differnet things
01:32	<randomwalker>	lando__: there seems to be a backup file called /etc/group-
01:32	<Gigi>	oh...
01:32	<Beastage>	who can help me? I want to make that the BOOT LOADER will default to Windows
01:32	<wallydalla1>	tom the geek,  have  you downloaded the ubuntu server cd and run the install?  this is my plan as currently I have risk with just one hd.  I have two 80gig IDE drives and I plan to re-install from the server CD
01:32	<iain>	ajehuk>	nope  'command not found'
01:32	<TomTheGeek>	i've tried partitioning the disks maunally but it always says it can't find the raid partitions
01:32	<IncredibleHink>	whats the pastebin url again?
01:32	<IncredibleHink>	!pastebin
01:32	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
01:32	<nibsa1242b>	*wonders* why do all these people seem to install to a single partition?
01:32	<yigal>	Beastage: just have windows as the first option
01:32	<iain>	ajehuk>	i tried /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart before
01:32	<TomTheGeek>	i"ve tried using the alternate install cd
01:32	<Beastage>	woha yigal
01:33	<errorlevel>	nibsa1242b: Why not?
01:33	<Gigi>	idefixx I will do the one that you told me then
01:33	<Beastage>	my real name is yigal
01:33	<DanZ3>	hello. I just burned the feisty cd and when i press "install" or "check cd for defects", I get a "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"  message. Is this a problem with the cd or my computer?
01:33	<ajehuk>	iain - sorry should be 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa restart'
01:33	<Beastage>	lol!
01:33	<yigal>	Beastage: nice :)
01:33	<eck>	underwatercow: I think if you keep /var clean you probably won't go above 6 GB or so for / (not including /home), even if you have lots of packaged and development headers and whatnot
01:33	<iain>	ajehuk>	and it returned 'Stopping alsa...... [ok]  starting alsa ..... [ok] ' but didn't fix the sound bug.
01:33	<Beastage>	yigal... pm
01:33	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, here is what my original fstab looks like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16933/
01:33	<eck>	underwatercow: then you have to add some space in that to prevent fragmentation and so forth
01:33	<wallydalla1>	tomthegeek,   it took me work to find it, but the 6.06 server cd is the one you want to find.  i will look for the URL.
01:33	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the second to last one is for dump and the last one is for fsck
01:33	<dredhammer>	hello does anyone know how i get Feisty to recognize the linksys usb wireless adapter?
01:33	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  I see a red diamond there
01:33	<lando__>	yes theres a backup how do i run nautilus as root i 4got the command
01:33	<lando__>	gtksudo or sumthing
01:34	<iain>	ajehuk>	the problem is that there's no such command (the alsa part)
01:34	<idefixx>	Gigi: right click on it - go to Select Windows Man. and chose Beryl
01:34	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the last one tells fsck whether to check the partition if there was a bad shutdown etc.
01:34	<randomwalker>	lando__: gksudo nautilus?
01:34	<underwatercow>	eck: is there a defragmenter in linux then?
01:34	<atlantia>	!nvidia
01:34	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
01:34	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the last one can be left as 0
01:34	<Beastage>	is there a point to install official ati drivers?
01:34	<idefixx>	Gigi: if you dont want to use it anymore switch back to Metacity
01:34	<lando__>	aww crap
01:34	<lando__>	it says to contact admin :(
01:34	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, and ummm the last one is up to you...I would say set it to 1
01:34	<yigal>	dredhammer: what does lsusb give you?
01:34	<Veronica-Bot>	server tecate.metachat.net
01:34	<lando__>	am i screwd?
01:35	<nibsa1242b>	errorlevel its always good to at least have a seperate /home partition so that you don't loose your data if something terrible happens and you have to reinstall... plus it makes it easier to backup.  I prefer having /home /usr /boot /root and /var at a min
01:35	<Gigi>	ok. it is done idefixx now I think that I have a small mess :P  I will keep on my own.  Thanks a lot man!!!!
01:35	<atlantia>	ok i am getting miffed. Is there a "how to unscrew-up and remove nvidia-drivers-issues-caused by once previously recommended scripts (envy) and use the new method which may not work???
01:35	<idefixx>	Gigi: have fun!
01:35	<randomwalker>	lando__: use the other person's nick while replying
01:35	<nibsa1242b>	errorlevel and also the swap but thats just me
01:35	<ajehuk>	iain can you drop the output of sudo  modprobe -l | grep alsa* into a pastebin?
01:35	<arooni>	what happens when i upgrade... do all my program files/docs stay Safe?
01:35	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, do i want suid or dev?
01:35	<atlantia>	cause right now, i have been back and forth between envy and this new great rstricted modules interface, and neither works now
01:35	<randomwalker>	lando__: yeah, looks like you're screwed
01:35	<nibsa1242b>	atlantia loot at the script and manually undo what it does
01:35	<eck>	underwatercow: no. at least for ext3, if you ever accidentally fill up the filesystem and want to defragment, you could run a script to move (well copy and then delete) files aroudn, since that will "unfragment" the files
01:35	<underwatercow>	does linux have a defragmenter?
01:35	<underwatercow>	lol
01:35	<atlantia>	i cant get a shred of consistency to save my arse
01:35	<randomwalker>	lando__: you can boot from the installer cd again and edit it
01:35	<atlantia>	pardon my french
01:36	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: suid
01:36	<wallydalla1>	nibsa1242b,  i wonder why the automatic ubuntu installer does not create a seperate partition for home folders?
01:36	<underwatercow>	eck: interesting
01:36	<lando__>	randomwalker: good idea
01:36	<lando__>	be right back
01:36	<tiglionabbit>	hello
01:36	<atlantia>	so yeah, it downloads and installs the nvidia automagic script
01:36	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: I could have shown you the other stuff
01:36	<iain>	ajehuk>	I'm sure i can (i've done similar before)....but I'm not what the URL is to post it up at ;)
01:36	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  which do you mean... "ati" or "radeon" ??
01:36	<underwatercow>	eck, Hor|zon: thanks for both of your help
01:36	<eck>	underwatercow: i have read some talk about making it easier to defragment ext4, but if you are experiencing fragmentation it's usually becauseyou did something wrong in the first place
01:36	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: uid is important
01:36	<jeef>	how can i swap which soundcard is my primary soundcard?
01:36	<Gigi>	idefixx Microsoft says "Wow" and they only have that weird thing... baryl must be wow x 1000
01:36	<tiglionabbit>	there's far too much traffic here.  Is there a more low-key ubuntu channel around?
01:36	<Beastage>	effie_jayx:  ATI Radeon drivers...
01:36	<ajehuk>	iain - http://pastebin.ca will do
01:36	<dredhammer>	yigal it lists both the linksys adapter and the mouse
01:36	<nibsa1242b>	wallydallal afaik its a hotly debated topic about how to properly partition and I believe bug reports have been submitted about that behavior
01:36	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=8
01:37	<Beastage>	effie_jayx: I assume that those that bundeled with ubuntu are good enuff
01:37	<dredhammer>	but i can't get it configured for use
01:37	<ajehuk>	!pastebin | iain
01:37	<ubotu>	iain: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
01:37	<Alonea>	tiglionabbit: the #kubuntu tends to be slower
01:37	<idefixx>	Gigi: its fun to play with. and good for impressing ppl ;)
01:37	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I like 3d stuff :S
01:37	<tiglionabbit>	Alonea: that all?
01:37	<yigal>	dredhammer: so you want wifi with linksys
01:37	<IncredibleHink>	yigal, thats what gets me confused.... i see the tutorials and they say this, /dev/hda7 /home ext3 nodev,nosuid 0 2, but i dont want to do something because someone told me to, i want to understand it, you know what i mean
01:37	<yigal>	dredhammer: what card is it using?
01:37	<underwatercow>	eck: actually. One last question... which would you recommend? ext3 or Reiserfs?
01:37	<iain>	ajehuk>	yeh i know what it is ;) just not where :-D thanks
01:37	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I am having a hard time with catching up with the crowd
01:38	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, for those options http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/mount.8.html
01:38	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, you just list them like a list
01:38	<yigal>	IncredibleHink: of course, uid is good because if names change or strange things happen uid will always allow the computer to id the partition
01:38	<Alonea>	tiglionabbit: for ubuntu specific channels yeah. I also goto ##linux for help which is usually slow, though sometimes gets a rush
01:38	<tiglionabbit>	anyways, I was gonna ask--   Today, I checked my update manager and noticed the distro upgrade button.  Well I decided to upgrade everything on this distro before dist-upgrading, and that happened to include an upgrade for the update manager.  But...   now the update manager doesn't show a dist upgrade button anymore
01:38	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, decide on the ones you want
01:38	<dunstabulos_>	i have installed samba and swat, what do i need to do to get it working ?
01:38	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, make sure they apply to ext3 though
01:38	<ajehuk>	iain - thought there was a link in that info - nevermind - as I said http://pastebin.ca is my preffered one...
01:38	<Beastage>	effie_jayx: yea its busy here
01:38	<iain>	ajehuk>http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16935/
01:39	<effie_jayx>	Beastage,  I mean with the latest 3d trends
01:39	<iain>	ajehuk>	lol yeh there was. was be being silly not noticing it
01:39	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, scroll down to -o
01:39	<effie_jayx>	:D
01:39	<dredhammer>	yigal wusb54gv2 wireless usb adapter
01:39	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, the options are there
01:39	<ajehuk>	iain - OK can you add the output of 'sudo lsmod' to that pastebin...
01:39	<nibsa1242b>	If I have a failed 64 bit edgy->	fiesty upgrade and I toast all the 64 data but keep my /home and install 32 bit fiesty will things go smoothly or will things in my /home not work correctly?
01:39	<yigal>	dredhammer: wusb54gv2 I got one of these up before - I think?
01:40	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, thx
01:40	<Gigi>	Everything that I change it is working but the cube hahaha
01:40	<dredhammer>	so what are the steps?
01:40	<ExpositionOfEvil>	hey
01:40	<ExpositionOfEvil>	I got a serious problem
01:40	<dredhammer>	without a net connection getting ndiswrapper could be a problem
01:41	<idefixx>	Gigi: press ctrl+alt+left-click (on desktop) and move the mouse.
01:41	<ExpositionOfEvil>	my top and bottom bars disappear after switching desktop spaces
01:41	<iain>	ajehuk>	done :)
01:41	<yigal>	dredhammer: do you have any drivers - if I recall correctly this is the route I took
01:41	<ajehuk>	iain - and the output of 'sudo lspci' as well..
01:41	<yigal>	dredhammer: ndiswrappers
01:41	<Gigi>	idefixx OK.  Thanks!
01:41	<RealistR>	hi.. running beryl on fesity... when I login.. there is no window decorator run.. just the beryl windows ... no titlebars... how can i get it to run?
01:42	<xjkx>	does ubuntu come with any cd burner by default?
01:42	<jbettcher>	RealistR:  you have to add beryl-manager to your startup programs under the session settings
01:42	<Supaplex>	xjkx: there'd k3b
01:42	<wallydalla1>	xjkx,  serpentine comes w ubuntu
01:42	<RealistR>	hi.. running beryl on fesity... when I login.. there is no window decorator run.. just the beryl windows ... no titlebars... how can i get it to run?  run on login that is.. if I run beryl-manager from the xterm its fine.. just not running whne logging back in to gdm
01:42	<RealistR>	jbettcher:  how
01:42	<dredhammer>	well no drivers saved to anything
01:42	<wallydalla1>	xjkx: test message
01:42	<Gigi>	idefixx and how do a put a wallpaper on the black ones?
01:42	<Morris_The_Cat>	Hi everyone... i just upgraded to Feisty which impressed me, but my internal master and slave disks were named sda and sdb by Feisty...why?
01:42	<underwatercow>	is Reiserfs better than ext3? It seems like ext3 is preferred
01:42	<jbettcher>	RealistR: under your preferences then sessions
01:42	<Xamusk>	hi
01:42	<xjkx>	Supaplex, k3b needs kdelibs, i would like ti cut it off, wallydalla1 is serpentine gtk based?
01:43	<dredhammer>	is it on the feisty disc by default?
01:43	<sanityx>	With the alternate cd, what exactley does it install when you install a command line system?
01:43	<RealistR>	under "startup programs" or under session options?
01:43	<idefixx>	Gigi: u thats called skydome dont know where it is anymore... just play around with the options there is a LOT of stuff in there.
01:43	<Xamusk>	does anyone knows where does gnome store it's xmodmaps?
01:43	<strick1>	Anyone know how to partiion and format an HFS+ (Apple format) USB drive on Ubuntu ?
01:43	<Gigi>	xjkx yes.  When you insert the CD it will prompt you to burn.  For an iso, right click and "Write to disk"
01:43	<Supaplex>	xjkx: I don't know.  there's wodim, but that's all commandline based.
01:43	<yigal>	dredhammer: I'm sorry I did it a year ago and I think it was with v1 not v2 so I am going to have to tell you I can't help much
01:43	<iain>	ajehuk>	there you go :)
01:43	<Gigi>	OK.  idefixx Thanks pal!
01:43	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one both bars disappear.
01:44	<nibsa1242b>	or alternatively is there anyway to rescue a failed edgy ->	fiesty upgrade I think one of the packages I dled was corrupted and it hard locks when I chroot into my root and do a dpkg --configure -a I have a seg fault from one of the font packages and some other problems... is there anyway to tell dpkg to undo all of the Fiesty upgrade so I can redo it?
01:44	<ajehuk>	iain - ta
01:44	<xjkx>	what about audio burning, does ubuntu come with any by default?
01:44	<wallydalla1>	xjkx: i don't know the api.  i just know that if you do a clean install of ubuntu 6.06 you get serpentine cd burner for music
01:44	<xjkx>	uhmm
01:44	<wallydalla1>	xjkx:  btw it will only burn a cd from OGG files as far as I know.
=== seth_ is now known as sethp
01:44	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, and no kde right?
01:44	<Morris_The_Cat>	Hi everyone... i just upgraded to Feisty which impressed me, but my internal master and slave disks were named sda and sdb by Feisty...why?
01:45	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one, both bars disappear.
01:45	<strick1>	Anyone know how to partiion and format an HFS+ (Apple format) USB drive on Ubuntu ?
01:45	<nibsa1242b>	Morris_The_Cat I can't tell you why, but I know its common and many people have reported that.
01:45	<wallydalla1>	kde is the GUI for Kubuntu.     Ubuntu has Gnome as the desktopmanager  i think.  i'm new
01:45	<Supaplex>	Morris_The_Cat: what were you using before? serial ata drives are now sdX
01:45	<Hor|zon>	you should be using ogg anyways
01:45	<razzorz>	i d/l the 7.4 iso how do i load it from the disk?..
01:45	<Hor|zon>	it's better than mp3 by a long shot
01:45	<Gigi>	This darn thing is crazy but nice.  I work a lot with the computer writing reports and doing investments.  This stuff will make it funnier :)  I have Linux Ubuntu since 2 years and I even remember what are blue dead screens and erros
01:45	<nibsa1242b>	Supaplex I thought sata drives were always sdx or at least mine were
01:45	<dredhammer>	well thats  a bummer
01:45	<tiglionabbit>	how do I upgrade to feisty from edgy?  The button isn't there
01:45	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, i know whats kde, i would just like to know if it comes by deafault, maybe bringing some qt libs
01:46	<Morris_The_Cat>	yesterday they were hda and hdb...after the installation they just changed to sda and sdb
01:46	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, try calling it there
01:46	<randomwalker>	i got a vexing question
01:46	<Morris_The_Cat>	i'm afraid something could happen to my files
01:46	<AnRkey>	I am trying to share a folder using SMB but i get this >>	'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled
01:46	<wallydalla1>	pardon my ignornace but why is OGG better than MP3?    i don't think OGG is supported by many devices
01:46	<sid>	I messed with madwifi to try and run openhal(without proprietary HAL), and it didn't work...now when I click on the network manager at the top right in gnome, it doesn't show any wireless access points. What package do I install and to fix it? how can I have it auto-over-write any files in the way
01:46	<randomwalker>	how do you pronouce sudo?
01:46	<Morris_The_Cat>	i made a backup though
01:46	<ajehuk>	iain - can you try doing a 'sudo modprobe -i snd-hda-intel' and then restarting alsa.. and see what happens
01:46	<Xamusk>	    state 0x0, keycode 94 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), same_screen YES,
01:46	<Xamusk>	I want to bind this keycode to backslash bar
01:46	<idefixx>	Morris_The_Cat: thats normal dont worry. internal changes
01:46	<Hor|zon>	wallydalla1, you can install kde in normal ubuntu, just apt get the kde-desktop package and at login you can choose kde
01:46	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, ogg is a free format
01:46	<wallydalla1>	su  dough
01:46	<Supaplex>	nibsa1242b: there's recent kernel changes in 2.6 to move all sata and pata drivers into their own subclass.  A few drivers provide both, and didn't map drives like they should have.
01:46	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one, both bars disappear.
01:46	<AnRkey>	does any1 know how to give fix this?
01:46	<AnRkey>	'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: usershares are currently disabled
01:47	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 I believe you get better quality at a lower bitrate with ogg
01:47	<wallydalla1>	mp3 does not cost anything to use does it?
01:47	<Hor|zon>	it's not free
01:47	<AnRkey>	wallydalla1, no i use it and it never charges me :D
01:47	<Morris_The_Cat>	ok ok thanx a lot...i'm breathing calmly now
01:47	<Morris_The_Cat>	:)
01:47	<Hor|zon>	well there used to be royalties it might be free now
01:47	<wallydalla1>	but in 20 years will anything play OGG files?    I bet in 20 years you can still play MP3 files
01:47	<Hor|zon>	I think I heard the patent expired?
01:48	<sethp>	So, any self-proclaimed GRUB masters here?
01:48	<ajehuk>	wallydalla1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Licensing_and_patent_issues
01:48	<markelhas>	hi ppl
01:48	<xjkx>	wallydalla1, it supports mp3 http://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/serpentine
01:48	<iain>	ajehuk>	not a lot.
01:48	<Hor|zon>	wallydalla1 well since ogg is completely open it's more likely ogg will be around...
01:48	<Supaplex>	!ask | sethp
01:48	<ubotu>	sethp: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
01:48	<forQed>	anyone try the Second Life Linux client yet?
01:48	<randomwalker>	is the reiserfs in feisty reiser4 or an earlier version?
01:48	<wallydalla1>	xjkx:   yes.     it is easy also to make the soundjuicer rip files as mp3
01:48	<markelhas>	trying to boot with ubuntu 7.04 cd in my laptop but always rebooting! any tips!?
01:48	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one, both bars disappear.
01:48	<Xamusk>	unfortunately, it looks like ogg has problems playing in embedded devices, because it uses floating points
01:49	<AnRkey>	forQed, there's a linux client? where?
01:49	<Hor|zon>	not really
01:49	<idefixx>	randomwalker: afaik rfs4 didnt make it to feisty... not sure tough
01:49	<Hor|zon>	I made sure all my players supported ogg
01:49	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 I imagine the opposite will be ture; think about today can you still play old windows games in XP or VISTA... no most of the time you can't but you can in linux under WINE... ogg is an open format and the knowledge to be able to read and use it will still be there 20 years from now it may or may not be for mp3
01:49	<forQed>	AnRkey, it is on their webpage, listed as alpha
01:49	<RealistR>	in beryl.. can I have more than the 4desktops?i have the gnomepanel virtual desktop thing running too and it seems to be kinda differnt cubes?...
01:49	<Johnny_>	i cant install a partition over 250gb annyknow whhy
01:49	<Hor|zon>	any decent player supports ogg...if you're willing to spend the money for a decent one
01:49	<azariah_d>	Greetings! I'm trying to change my resolution from 1024x768 to 1280x1024, and I'm not sure what to add in the xorg.conf, when I added "1280x1024" under depth 24, nothing was displayed at startup.
01:49	<iain>	ajehuk>	not a lot happened.
01:49	<markelhas>	trying to boot with ubuntu 7.04 cd in my laptop but always rebooting! any tips!?
01:50	<Hor|zon>	personally mine was $600 so it plays basically anything
01:50	<Hor|zon>	:P
01:50	<ExpositionOfEvil>	markelhas did u burn it correctly?
01:50	<wallydalla1>	yikes   $600 for a music player.
01:50	<ajehuk>	iain - OK situation is - drivers for the sound system are in, all relevant applications doing what they should but no sound.  the card isnt coming out of hibernate... 2 suggestions first, would be to log out and back in and see if it makes any difference (it wont) 2 report the bug with the hibernate people .  I would suggest there is a 50% chance of it being an issue with suspend and 50% problem with the driver..
01:50	<AnRkey>	forQed, never tried Second Life. what's it like?
01:50	<randomwalker>	wallydalla1, in the future ogg support will probably get better but at present it's crap
01:51	<LoneShadow>	do people still have to edit configure files by hand ?
01:51	<nibsa1242b>	I still need an anwser to if installing 32 bit fiesty on a system that used to have 64 bit edgy will mess anything up if I keep my /home but get rid of everything else.
01:51	<LoneShadow>	configuration*
01:51	<forQed>	AnRkey, I haven't either, but since they have a Linux client I thought I might give it a go
01:51	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects on cube mode and set my bottom bar to show two desktops, and click the second one, both bars disappear.
01:51	<adaptr>	of course, only lusers use GUIs :P
01:51	<nibsa1242b>	LoneShadow, its the best way to go
01:51	<ajehuk>	nibsa1242b - no
01:51	<iain>	ajehuk>	cool. Thanks bro. Logging out doesn't work. I've tried just restarting X which requires that....
01:51	<iain>	ajehuk>	rebooting the comp does ergo my setup is usually fine.
01:51	<adaptr>	ExpositionOfEvil: that's ebcause beryl doesn't care about your desktop settings - use the manager
01:51	<LoneShadow>	I was under the impression, feisty was meant to invite people who dont want to mess with config files :)
01:51	<iain>	ajehuk>	so it looks like there's a bug somewhere
01:51	<ajehuk>	iain - looks like the hardware state after coming out of suspend isnt 100% -
01:52	<ExpositionOfEvil>	adaptr and beryls built in?!
01:52	<iain>	ajehuk>	where do I bugrep?
01:52	<LoneShadow>	There are lot of frontends for all configs, I hope they are packaged by default with feisty
01:52	<AnRkey>	forQed, i laughed when i saw that people buy virtual property and stuff
01:52	<nibsa1242b>	ajehuk thanks, I didn't think it would but edgy->	fiesty upgrade already messed up so much and I didn't relish doing a fresh install of fiesty and having to deal with all the custom config to get 64 to work as well as 32 does out of the box
01:52	<markelhas>	trying to boot with ubuntu 7.04 cd in my laptop but always rebooting! any tips!?
01:52	<adaptr>	ExpositionOfEvil: "when I turn on desktop effects on cube mode" - >	beryl
01:52	<sethp>	Supaplex: Yeah, but every time I ask my question no one responds
01:52	<LoneShadow>	maybe questions to ask for next week :D
01:52	<jeef>	is there any way to easily troubleshoot sound problems? anyone?
01:52	<azariah_d>	LoneShadow: So thought I, until I noticed some options where not there in the graphic configurations.
01:53	<wallydalla1>	is anyone using GAIM right now to chat.   I need a few chat tips.
01:53	<ExpositionOfEvil>	adaptr Wrokspaces on a cube?
01:53	<sethp>	Supaplex: So I figured I'd ask that first, and let anyone who thinks they're a grub master get their ego to pressure them into answering me even if they really don't know what's going on
01:53	<idefixx>	Hor|zon: iPod + Rockbox?
01:53	<Supaplex>	sethp: try the forums or a mailing list.
01:53	<adaptr>	ExpositionOfEvil: erm, yes
01:53	<azariah_d>	wallydalla1: I am
01:53	<bill>	ok, I B a total newbie; in the past week I've repartitioned my HD, installed 64 bit Effy, figured out how to edit xorg.conf, struggled to get my dual monitors working, upgraded to Feisty, finally got the dual monitor working, installed Automatix, installed a whole mess of packages including 32bit Firefox with Flash, installed a network printer, got recognized on my home network and I just wanted to stop in and say "hello" to you all
01:53	<Ax4>	wallydalla1, huh? willing to bet most here use gaim....
01:53	<adaptr>	ExpositionOfEvil: is this new to you ? then I'm sorta curious what *you* meant

01:53	<Hor|zon>	idefixx: nope...I wanted a linux based player
01:53	<LoneShadow>	azariah_d: atleast if the basic options are in the GUI setup thats good enough for now, maybe they can give GUI with advance options later
01:53	<wallydalla1>	azariah_d:  did you get this message ?   how do 2 people chat without all the high volume
01:54	<AnRkey>	sorry for asking again but it's driving me nuts
01:54	<ajehuk>	iain - interesting test would be to turn off the sound system - hibernate - start up again and enable it see if the problem is still there (it should be if its hardware but as I said it'd be interesting) as to bug reporting Im not sure who would be best to report to but I asume you'd go through the ubuntu but https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs looks like an option - either that or take alook at the man page for hibernate / suspend to s
01:54	<nibsa1242b>	bill your route would have been so much easier if you had just gone with 32 bit
01:54	<Jack3>	is cups included in ubunut?
01:54	<Ax4>	bill, glad you got your stuff working, might i suggest 32 bit next time

01:56	<ExpositionOfEvil>	adaptr then set it to show two work spaces

02:04	<sanityx>	What gets installed when you install a command line system off the alternate cd

02:04	<wallydalla1>	At0mic_PC:   did you try some headphones and make sure the volume is turned up.

We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use.

02:06	<asdfasdf>	lol
02:06	<Fylk>	How did you get it working AX4? And I mean comiceral DVDs
02:06	<ajehuk>	badkitty - I missed it - whats up
02:06	<nibsa1242b>	asdfasdf ok, I'm pretty sure there is a manual out there that allows you to do that... I used it when I did a network install of my edgy and I'm pretty sure it mentioned something about usb I'm trying to google it
02:06	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects and set a firefox window to fullscreen I cant close it

02:07	<wallydalla1>	is there any better solution that automatix.  i  find it works well for instlling google earth and real player and the java plugin for firefox.  all tools that i need when I setup systems for friends.
02:08	<badkitty>	I think i saw an upgrade from iso feature in the docs somewhere
02:08	<asdfasdf>	wallydalla1 ive had luck with easyubuntu
02:08	<pavan>	hi! I am trying to install netbeans but it says it requires java 1.5 but instead is finding 1.4 version.. 1.4 is installed, so how do I change the path?
02:08	<Fylk>	ajehuk, help?
02:08	<nibsa1242b>	asdfasdf I think its a tad more complicated then that you have to make the flash drive bootable or something and you might even need a special iso I don't remember I'm still looking so I don't want to say something incorrect
02:08	<wallydalla1>	what is easyubuntu?   is that like automatix
02:08	<stefg>	wallydalla1: getting a proper sources.list and using apt is cleaner and quicker
02:08	<Ax4>	pavan, sudo nano -w /etc/profile
02:08	<asdfasdf>	yea
02:08	<spikeb>	wallydalla1: yes, only it doesn't suck as much.
02:08	<Ax4>	pavan, add your new path in there
02:08	<LjL>	wallydalla1: why not just install them with the tool that's been provided since forever - APT? google earth is available from the medibuntu repository, same (i think) for real player, java is available in the official repositories
02:09	<wallydalla1>	ok, sucks less.  good.   i will google that now
02:09	<badkitty>	Automatix broke my system bad and I lost lots of time (especially cause I had beryl working after many issues)
02:09	<pavan>	Ax4: oh ok.. thanks..

02:09	<badkitty>	Automatix actually installed an upgrade when there was none lol
02:09	<asdfasdf>	nibsa1242b lol my mobo and bios support usb in the boot, i do a f8 and it can boot to my ipod (it doesnt work though lol)
02:09	<ExpositionOfEvil>	When I turn on desktop effects and set a firefox window to fullscreen I cant close it
02:09	<wallydalla1>	yes. automatix broke a test system for me once.   post automatix i could not use APT-GET
02:09	<nibsa1242b>	wallydalla1 and installing stuff without a proper source list can make it difficult when you upgrade from your current version of ubuntu

02:10	<wallydalla1>	well i mostly use ubuntu for systems I never plan to upgrade.
02:10	<Agony>	Hey guys, I have a problem. After upgrading to Feisty from Edgy, my laptop now refuses to play sound, and gives the error: "Could not open resource for writing." everytime a sound is attempted to be played.
02:10	<DB42>	but everything seems to be working ok :)
02:10	<ExpositionOfEvil>	adaptr this bug has nothing to do with my card
02:10	<stefg>	I can only warn about the use of Automatix.... there's frequently people in here whose systems got hosed by it, to the point of format and reinstall
02:10	<TokenBad>	hmm...I can't use my terminal
02:10	<OrTigaS>	when i minimize a window, it was hidden. where i can enable it?
02:10	<nibsa1242b>	asdfasdf mine is the same... but just like you can't put all the files in an iso on a cd and expect it to boot I think there is a special way to make flash drives bootable
02:10	<azariah_d>	DB42: how did you change the monitor resolution?
02:10	<wallydalla1>	I have an ubuntu server and I never touch that.  when I want to play with ubuntu I use a different machine.

02:11	<TokenBad>	terminal opens but is all white
02:11	<ExpositionOfEvil>	Set desktop effects ON and move a window to the middle of the screen and make it full screen.  The only way to close it is by right clicking it on the bottom and sellecting close
02:11	<DB42>	making up scan rates monitor might be bad on crt monitors (i have WS LCD)

02:24	<ajehuk>	Fylk - those lines need to be added to /etc/sources.list (anywhere at the bottom) but you can happily replace edgy with feisty i.e. 'deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ edgy free non-free' becomes 'deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ feisty free non-free'

02:30	<TirEoghain>	Well, this is where it breaks down, lol, I am unable to provide you with details as I am new to Linux (at least install proprietary drivers) and I am not sure what is going wrong
02:30	<ajehuk>	Dante123 - no idea, havent had the chance to look at the dual cores yet.. I would guess the regular CD would work - but that is a guess ( a blind one really )
02:30	<Impaque>	Dante123: i386 would be a safe bet, though if he feels brave and daring, he might try amd64 version
02:30	<stp2007>	question. How long does the Ubuntu installation take from CD? If the answer is 40 minutes or so (on an admittedly older laptop) then everything is ok.

02:31	<Dante123>	ok.......thanks all
02:31	<TirEoghain>	fglrxinfo confirms that I am not using ATI drivers, however, when I started my machine, Unbunutu warned me I was using 'proprietary drivers'
02:31	<Abom>	someone said I should look for the windows equivelant of the registry editor
02:31	<wastrel>	Abom:  there's no registry as such

02:32	<debaser>	*USE GENTOO
02:32	<zipped20x>	how do you add a repository?
02:32	<wallydalla1>	Kazol: try ubuntu from the server cd ISO image.  some call it the alternate cd i think.
02:32	<zazeem>	are there any nvidia tweaks to add in the xorg cfg other than on ubuntu guide?
02:32	<pixelation>	wallydallal, thanks man, umm, all my windows have no border and only open on the left top of my screen and are unmovable without f7, what's up with that, how do I fix it?
02:32	<Kazol>	ajehuk: software, I've spent over 4 hours trying to get it to work

02:33	<obsethryl>	hello, are there any known issues in the lvm setup using the alternative cd install? I have a rather huge lvm + raid storage set here i want to plug in during installation
02:33	<ajehuk>	Kazol - hmm ubuntu should do, I'd use debian stable for it, but the issues would be similar on both.  For a webserver that will be under any sort of load I would suggest hardware raid tho
02:33	<debaser>	well I'm not here to discuss that
02:33	<Impaque>	debaser: read up on slashdot and such.. staying current through bleeding edge is VERY bad

02:40	<VividHazE>	:)
02:40	<zipped20x>	is there a website or some place i could go to download updates for my computer one at a time?
02:40	<randomwalker>	stp2007, describe exactly what happened after you clicked install. just a blank window?
02:40	<debaser>	NobleComm, use /var/log/Xorg.0.log
02:40	<nuked_omen>	debaser: when my upgrade gets broken, it resumes automatically when i start it again
02:40	<obsethryl>	excuse me for repeating the request, are there any known issues in the lvm setup using the alternative cd install? I have a rather huge lvm + raid storage set here i want to plug in during installation; current google search gives nothing but i want to avoid mistakes, thanks

02:40	<stp2007>	randomwalker, lots of disk access and eventually a blank window. To be honest I can't remember because I was doing other things as well. I just rebooted and will try to reinstall again.
02:41	<Impaque>	VividHazE: did you do sudo exportfs -ra afterwards?
02:41	<randomwalker>	stp2007, if you have 256 megs
02:41	<Impaque>	VividHazE: (reloads /etc/exports)
02:41	<VividHazE>	on the client or the server impaque
02:41	<VividHazE>	both?
02:41	<randomwalker>	stp2007, you don't have enough memory to install and do lots of other things at the same time
02:41	<debaser>	actually I can't start it again
02:41	<rookiehwm>	my keyboard shortcut isn't working :( alt-f2 is still opening the gnome terminal, not aterm
02:41	<rookiehwm>	anyone know how to fix this?
02:41	<debaser>	I can't boot
02:41	<randomwalker>	stp2007, so try not opening other programs other than the installer
02:41	<stp2007>	randomwalker, I was doing the other stuff on my other laptop :)
02:41	<randomwalker>	stp2007, oh. then try to see how much memory it's using
02:41	<ajehuk>	Kazol - back to your raid issue -
02:42	<Kazol>	ajehuk: ok
02:42	<stp2007>	randomwalker, how can I determine that?
02:42	<ajehuk>	Kazol - does this machine have any other OS's installed?

02:42	<Impaque>	VividHazE: server
02:42	<TirEoghain>	that paste service is a damn good idea, how long do the entries stay live for?
02:43	<stp2007>	randomwalker, ok will give that a try when able to. Might be a bit because I really didn't have mouse control (slow. etc)
02:43	<foxhound>	Hi,I have an asus wl-167g wireless USB adapter and I would like to know if it is going to be recognised by ubuntu,or if I have to make some configurations
02:43	<randomwalker>	stp2007, yeah, sounds bad, probably best just reboot

02:43	<Ax4>	she's nuts i swear

02:44	<ubotu>	VividHazE: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
02:44	<Winkerbean>	Impaque, perhaps this highlights my ignorance.  How would one open a dvd to use similar to a floppy?  (Maybe *this* highlights my age.)
02:45	<debaser>	nuked_omen: I still have the shipped 5.10 liveCD so I can mount /root
02:45	<nuked_omen>	Ax4: i don't see how telling someone about your girlfriend can help him
02:45	<randomc0de>	so I installed the msttcorefonts recently because the mythtv package requires them, but now Firefox looks horrible... is there any way I can get the old fonts back without remove the msttcorefonts package? I tried just renaming the directories they installed to
02:45	<debaser>	I just needed to know if it was possible
02:45	<xtknight>	!raid
02:45	<ubotu>	Raid and LVM -->	very easy guide for alternate CD : http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/raid.html Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
02:45	<debaser>	I can't risk that computer to a data loss
02:45	<VividHazE>	thanks impque and nuked_omen, heres the output from that exportfs -ra command, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16949/
02:45	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: by using programs like k3b in KDE or it's equivalent in gnome. nero-like
02:45	<debaser>	I guess a chroot should work
02:45	<VR_>	whenever i play an .avi file in totem, my whole system freezes. i do have "Ubuntu restricted extras" installed as well as w32codecs. am i missing something?
02:46	<TirEoghain>	I also see a headline that the new beta of Nero for Linux is out as well Winkerbean
02:46	<randomwalker>	is there a way to sort the output of the /list command by number of users or something? i get this massive output that i can't make sense of
02:46	<Kazol>	I already tried all RAID approaches, it did not work. I asked on forums, IRC, etc., no one could solve my problem
02:46	<Ax4>	i think it did help him, shhh!
02:46	<VividHazE>	impaque i got your name wrong there, i just posted the pastebin thing, in case you didn't notice it http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16949/
02:46	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: (afaik, it still can't work as in WinXP f.e., to open it, drag & drop some files and just select "burn" from a menu)
02:46	<DARKGuy>	hey, anybody knows how to record the screen output ?
02:46	<xtknight>	how do i remove a raid0 array for good?  it's not as easy as it sounds.....
02:46	<Ax4>	ok zipped20x : http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/ <--- try this
02:46	<DARKGuy>	like, to make a video of an app or my desktop
02:46	<debaser>	*BASH REDIRECTION
02:46	<nuked_omen>	debaser: why not plug your harddrive as a slave in another computer and take whatever you want, or you can boot a live cd and get all your data on dvds or an external hard drive
02:46	<zipped20x>	brb
02:46	<Winkerbean>	Impaque: Oh. Whoops. :-[  Thanks.
02:46	<nuked_omen>	then you can play with it without the risk
02:47	<mistaWAC>	hello?
02:47	<Winkerbean>	TirEoghain, thank you, as well.
02:47	<TirEoghain>	np
02:47	<mistaWAC>	am I finally in this chat thing?
02:47	<Kazol>	ajehuk: Thanks. Is it text-based and will it be easy to use software RAID-1?
02:47	<DARKGuy>	mistaWAC: yeah
02:47	<Winkerbean>	Yes, mistaWAC, wuzzup?
02:47	<Impaque>	Winkerbean: np, just find a nice DVD burning app
02:47	<nuked_omen>	mistaWAC: no
02:47	<mistaWAC>	nice....new to linux and been at joining this server for a while
02:47	<debaser>	I can boot in the network and copy everything through samba but I haven't any computer with more than 2 GB free, and I need at least 6
02:47	<zipped20x>	trying. . . .
02:47	<zipped20x>	would having edgy make a difference?
02:47	<DARKGuy>	mistaWAC: welcome :D

02:48	<DARKGuy>	anybody knows how to record the screen output? like, for recording a video of my desktop or app tutorial? o.o;
02:48	<Impaque>	VividHazE: space is a no-go
02:48	<debaser>	There are a wide variety of solutions but the most fast is trying to resume reinstall, so I first want to discard that
02:48	<debaser>	that possibility
02:48	<Impaque>	VividHazE: try quoting
02:48	<Kazol>	What is your opinion? I have a 800Mhz 256MB 2x10GB webserver; how many connections\bandwidth will it hadle before saturation?
02:48	<debaser>	*the faster
02:48	<DARKGuy>	!ask | mistaWAC
02:48	<NobleCommerc1>	debaser: i checked my log, no metion of the refresh rate at all
02:48	<ubotu>	mistaWAC: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
02:48	<debaser>	*the fastest
02:48	<debaser>	sorry
02:48	<ajehuk>	Kazol - but then thats true for all.
02:48	<chrissturm>	is it safe to upgrade to feisty on a server with a software raid and lvm2?
02:48	<mistaWAC>	!ask
02:48	<mistaWAC>	whoops
02:48	<mistaWAC>	what?  I'm new to linux mn...throw me a bone
02:48	<VividHazE>	impaque: space is a no go? try quoting?  Call me stupid, which I am, but what do you mean? :S
02:49	<DARKGuy>	mistaWAC: just ask your question :P
02:49	<mistaWAC>	lol
02:49	<DARKGuy>	if anybody knows, they'll reply
02:49	<debaser>	NobleComm: I don't know what could be the problem, there should be a message there
02:49	<Kazol>	ajehuk: I'll try it. I am making efforts to convert everything to Ubuntu now.
02:49	<Impaque>	VividHazE: you have a space in directory name. "Shared Files"
02:49	<mistaWAC>	okay...this is the thing...I'm trying to turn this Ubuntu box into a server for a VPN that Windows Clients can connect to.
02:49	<Impaque>	VividHazE: you'll have to quote, or, prepend a \ before space, like this: Shared\ Files
02:49	<mistaWAC>	Can that be done and if so, hw?
02:49	<VividHazE>	impaque: ahhh, ok i'll try brb
02:49	<Impaque>	VividHazE: (ie. "escape" it)
02:49	<DARKGuy>	anybody knows how to record the screen output? like, for recording a video of my desktop or app tutorial?
02:49	<debaser>	NobleComm: it should be preceded by a WW
02:50	<TirEoghain>	Impaque, I am looking through this log again, and the ATI driver seems to load fine, could that be possible, there is no (EE) type messages around where I think it loads the fglrx module
02:50	<Morpheus_74>	lliniinux basics
02:50	<Impaque>	TirEoghain: does lsmod show fglrx module?
02:50	<NobleCommerc1>	nope :(
02:50	<jessid>	hello. I have installed Ubuntu 7.04 for x86 arch. when I try to enable the restricted module of Nvidia, it does not allows me...is that possible to fix? how??? thanks a lot!!!
02:50	<wallydalla1>	mistaWAC:   you might buy a linksys box to use while you debug your ubuntu box.  this will keep you sane.
02:50	<Impaque>	TirEoghain: (or what's the name again, i'm not using that driver..)
02:51	<NobleCommerc1>	the tv out is working, looks great... i just want to make sure the refresh is 60hz
02:51	<debaser>	NobleComm: or you're using another configuration file, or another log file, or you didn't check with enough precission, that's all I can tell you, but could be perfectly something else.
02:51	<randomc0de>	is there a way I can force Firefox to use the non-msttcore fonts without removing the package?
02:51	<TirEoghain>	Impaque, : fglrx                 540004  0
02:51	<VR_>	whenever i play an .avi file in totem, my whole system freezes. i do have "Ubuntu restricted extras" installed as well as w32codecs. am i missing something?
02:51	<southafrikanse>	No sound on Ubuntu Feisty. Need help
02:51	<wallydalla1>	does anyone know a PCI wifi card that i can buy used that will work easily with Ubuntu?
02:51	<TirEoghain>	so i guess that means yes?
02:51	<eck>	randomc0de: you can change the default font, but many web pages will specify the font to use for the page by font name (e.g. Arial)
02:51	<boss>	For kickstart configuration of Ubuntu, if I specify a postinstallation script with %post, am I by default in a chroot?
02:51	<debaser>	I don't know how you can do it, but I've had that problem and checking in monitorworld and setting up things correctly was the solution
02:51	<mistaWAC>	Wally, lol...sanity isn't a problem..I am fairly patient and if a basic idea is given on how to do this, I can probably manage to figure it out
02:51	<NobleCommerc1>	well i'm sure i'm using xorg.conf, cause i just set the tv out settings in it and tv out began working
02:52	<boss>	If so, does %post --nochroot work in Ubuntu?
02:52	<debaser>	but I guess that's not your problem
02:52	<DARKGuy>	anybody knows how to record the screen output? like, for recording a video of my desktop or app tutorial?
02:52	<NobleCommerc1>	i defined my monitor with a horizontal rate to 30-50, vertrefresh 60

02:52	<NobleCommerc1>	i'll just have to assume its working fine
02:52	<Fylk>	How do i install a package from a tar?
02:52	<DARKGuy>	cool, thanks crimsun
02:52	<debaser>	than I can't help you more, I just recommend you check very carefully the settings
02:52	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, its is possible to setup a VPN connection via ipsec, look into "vpnc"
02:52	<Ax4>	it*
02:52	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Need help again
02:52	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: ?
02:52	<VividHazE>	Whats the command to display my IP address?
02:52	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: I had to reinstall Ubuntu again
02:52	<mistaWAC>	I have KVpnc though, but from the looks of it it's just a client thing...how do I configure taht
02:53	<eck>	boss: isn't kickstart redhat/fedora only?
02:53	<debaser>	ifconfig
02:53	<mistaWAC>	configure it to be a server?
02:53	<boss>	eck: No, it's available for Ubuntu as well.
02:53	<VividHazE>	thanks debaser
02:53	<debaser>	VividHaZe: ifconfig
02:53	<wastrel>	there's kickstart for ubunto i saw a web page about it
02:53	<NemesisD>	hi guys, real quick because my memory is failing me, whats the command to view all connected hard drives and partitions on them?
02:53	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: You helped me yesterday with my sound problem
02:53	<debaser>	you are welcome
02:53	<wallydalla1>	NobleCommerc1:   i am a teacher and i use hardware.   i got a 2 boxes.   an avermedia box that converts VGA to composite video.  Then you can use any firewire camera hooked up to iMovie
02:53	<boss>	eck: It's just not as well integrated as Redhat's ISOs are.
02:53	<eck>	i see
02:53	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: But I had to reinstall Ubuntu again
02:53	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Don'y know if you remember me

02:54	<Shaba1>	hey guys and ladies
02:54	<peeps>	can anyone help me boot from a USB external cd drive?  I can't figure it out
02:54	<VividHazE>	debaser: When I'm entering my IP address so I can share files do you use the inet address or the Broadcast address?
02:54	<Fylk>	Guys, how do I install from a tar?
02:54	<Shaba1>	is there a reliable vnc server for linux
02:54	<Hobart>	Anyone know how to blow away all graphic configs and ask Ubuntu to re-detect / configure graphics like it does during install?
02:54	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: which model did you have to use?
02:54	<Shaba1>	I have not found one by seaching synamptic
02:54	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  your motherboard BIOS must support boot from USB.
02:54	<Impaque>	TirEoghain: no idea :( try following the guide again, sorry
02:54	<randomc0de>	Fylk: is depends on what you want to install
02:54	<Fylk>	Wait..
02:54	<debaser>	VividHaZe: you want to access a computer?
02:54	<NemesisD>	anyone? what's the command to view all hard disks and their volumes? i've forgotten it
02:54	<peeps>	wallydalla1, it does supposedly.  I set the first boot device to USB-CDROM, but it is not working
02:54	<debaser>	if that's the case you use IP
02:54	<boss>	wastrel: !kickstart >	username prevents the channel from getting spammed. Just as an aside.

02:55	<debaser>	broadcast is for sending packages to every machine in the network
02:55	<VividHazE>	debaser: No I'm setting up NFS and I need to enter the location of the file...wait...gah i'm stupid brb
02:55	<peeps>	wallydalla1, i have USB 2.0, but the drive is telling me it is connected to 1.1 (it has a red/green) indicator light
02:55	<debaser>	well in that case you use IP
02:55	<techfiz_>	Hi All
02:55	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  well then i guess you should reformat your USB drive and then install the OS to the USB.  many tools to do that see google
02:55	<techfiz_>	i'm trying to nat the connection to my vmware ubuntu installation
02:55	<debaser>	or hostname if you have a correct /etc/hosts
02:56	<ozymandias>	for future reference, how does one select the desktop enviroment when installing? I don't want to have to download 200meg to fix this if I can just do it right from the start
02:56	<jessid>	hello. I have installed Ubuntu 7.04 for x86 arch. when I try to enable the restricted module of Nvidia, it does not allows me...is that possible to fix? how??? thanks a lot!!!
02:56	<Yahooadam>	hey guys, i want to mount an iso on a networked computer, how do i find a network computer in terminal to use - sudo mount file.iso /media/iso/ -t iso9660 -o loop
02:56	<techfiz_>	 1012  iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface vmnet1  -j ACCEPT

02:56	<mistaWAC>	how am I supposed to configure KVpnc to make my Linux desktop act as a server and allow Windows clients to log in and be a part of the VPN?
02:56	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, you want a server setup? ok look into pptpd
02:56	<Fylk>	Random, I'm trying to install Libdvdcss
02:56	<TirEoghain>	Impaque, thanks for the help! I have nothing on this Ubuntu install, so might just reformat and go back to the free driver
02:56	<TirEoghain>	thanks again
02:56	<peeps>	wallydalla1, ?? it's a CD drive, what do you mean reformat
02:56	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, thanks!
02:56	<techfiz_>	do I need to do anything else on vmware guest operating system
02:56	<Impaque>	TirEoghain: sorry i wasn't of more help, good luck!
02:56	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, sudo apt-get install pptpd
02:56	<mistaWAC>	okay...thanks
02:56	<wallydalla1>	peeps:   have you ever gotten your USB drive to boot >
02:57	<eck>	mistaWAC: vpnc is a client only
02:57	<peeps>	wallydalla1, no i just got it
02:57	<mistaWAC>	grr...I thought so
02:57	<mistaWAC>	but a bunch o people said it was server side too
02:57	<cabajgtr>	Whats the best way to migrate an install from one hard drive to another when I can't connect them simultaneously ( but I can copy them to 3rd firewire drive )
02:57	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, i misunderstood your needs, use pptpd
02:57	<eck>	mistaWAC: if you want a free vpn server you might fo with openvpn
02:57	<mistaWAC>	thanks
02:57	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  if it is new, you have to install an OS before u can boot
02:57	<debaser>	Yahooadam: explain more precisely please, the computer is booted from network or the iso is in a network?
02:57	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: echo options snd-hda-intel model=lg|sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
02:57	<mistaWAC>	I thought that was for Linux-Linux connections only though?
02:57	<Yahooadam>	debaser - the iso is on a networked computer
02:57	<kbidd>	does ubuntu have a firewall enabled by default?
02:57	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, edit pptpd's config at /etc/pptpd.conf
02:58	<eck>	mistaWAC: no, it is cross platform
02:58	<Ax4>	once you haev it installed
02:58	<Ax4>	have*
02:58	<randomwalker>	Yahooadam: ssh or samba or something else?
02:58	<eck>	mistaWAC: we used to use openvpn at work, had clients on linux/windows/mac
02:58	<debaser>	Yahooadam: then you must first mount the partition holding the iso file
02:58	<mistaWAC>	I had that earlier and couldn't get any Linux-Windows help for it...will try that too
02:58	<wallydalla1>	hey,   has anyone out there found a WiFi card that is plug and play with Ubuntu.  I don't want to mess with NDIS or any command line stuff
02:58	<mistaWAC>	thanks
02:58	<Fylk>	Some one help me with: http://download.videolan.org/pub/libdvdcss/1.2.9/
02:58	<NobleCommerc1>	cabajgtr: boot from cd, copy one drive to the firewire, connect the other drive, boot again from cd, partition the new drive, migrate files?
02:58	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, well you have a few options, pick one of ours and get back to us! lol
02:59	<Yahooadam>	randomwalker - its on a windows computer, and i can see the folder in the graphical viewer thing, i just dont know how to get at it from the terminal
02:59	<debaser>	Yahooadam: ssh, telnet or rsh work but I think its not the correct solution, you should use smbmount (samba) or NFS
02:59	<randomc0de>	Fylk: trying to install libdvdcss?
02:59	<NobleCommerc1>	cabajgtr: i've never moved an install from one drive to another though, that may not work at all
02:59	<Ax4>	im sure eck's would work as well, i've only used pptpd
02:59	<bernarderase>	Anyone have a clever idea how I can get fullscreen video output to a tv (using vlc & nvidia drivers)
02:59	<mistaWAC>	so either pptpd or openvpn works?
02:59	<peeps>	wallydalla1, i am trying to boot a live cd.  FROM A CD ROM DRIVE
02:59	<Fylk>	Random: Yep.
02:59	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, try one heh
02:59	<Yahooadam>	debaser - ok - how do i do that :p
02:59	<debaser>	Yahooadam: you must mount it
02:59	<debaser>	Yahooadam: see the documentation of smbmount
02:59	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, ubuntu is about choice :p
02:59	<VividHazE>	debaser, Impaque: OMG! It isn't working yet but its saying more than "can't recognise what your on about" message, its saying Permission denied. So...what do I do now? If you have a spare minute :S
02:59	<kbidd>	does ubuntu have a software firewall enabled by default?
02:59	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  ohhh sorry.       did you set your BIOS to boot from CD as the first device.
02:59	<randomc0de>	Fylk: do you have vlc installed?
03:00	<wizard>	crimsun: do you know if my sound issue has been resolved in feisty on the released version?
03:00	<Shaba1>	Anyone here ever use snort
03:00	<Fylk>	Random: Yes
03:00	<Impaque>	VividHazE: paste your /etc/exports on pastebin pls
03:00	<Shaba1>	I wonder how it compares with IPCOP
03:00	<peeps>	wallydalla1, yeah
03:00	<snowbert>	#xbins
03:00	<eck>	kbidd: i believe it is installed, but does not run by default
03:00	<[ithaycu] >	My sound issues have not cleared yet.
03:00	<debaser>	pls I still need help
03:00	<debaser>	anyone?
03:00	<kbidd>	eck, do you know which firewall it is -- i need to verify its turned off.
03:00	<Yahooadam>	so id do 'smbmount *compname* /path/to/mount' ?
03:00	<[ithaycu] >	Of course I messing around with ffmpeg right now
03:00	<eck>	kbidd: iptables
03:00	<Fylk>	Debaser, what is wrong?
03:00	<debaser>	yes
03:00	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: options snd-hda-intel model=lg
03:00	<wallydalla1>	peeps:  ok,  now,   do you have a CD that you know is good for booting.  aka it will boot from CD in your friend's computer?
03:00	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Now what?
03:01	<debaser>	Yahooadam: but for example //PC/shared
03:01	<debaser>	check the documentation
03:01	<eck>	kbidd: just run iptables-save and check that there is no output
03:01	<rogue780|laptop>	can someone point to some kind of tutorial on making a usplash theme?
03:01	<VividHazE>	Impaque: For the server or the client? or both?
03:01	<debaser>	Fylk: I can't boot because of a broken upgrade
03:01	<Fylk>	Arg, not good.
03:01	<Impaque>	VividHazE: server. client can mount using a single line..
03:01	<debaser>	Fylk: I want to know if I can resume the upgrade booting from a CD.
03:02	<Impaque>	VividHazE: for client, you don't use /etc/exports at all! you mount using the command-line, or, if you want it permanent, via /etc/fstab
03:02	<debaser>	Fylk: anyway I can reinstall from scratch after backing up but this is much faster.
03:02	<stefg>	!usplash
03:02	<ubotu>	To select the usplash artwork you want, use "sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so && sudo update-initramfs -u" - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto for adding your custom artwork
03:02	<ardchoille>	rogue780|laptop: Does this help: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto?highlight=%28usplash%29
03:02	<crimsun>	southafrikanse: reboot
03:02	<randomc0de>	Fylk: there's a script for it at /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
03:03	<rogue780|laptop>	ardchoille, probably, thanks
03:03	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: Don't need to save anything?
03:03	<ozymandias>	how do i get ubuntu to install kde when I install ubuntu? this whole having to download a giant set of packages and then manually remove gnome thing is sort of retarded
03:03	<peeps>	wallydalla1, yeah the cd is good
03:03	<mistaWAC>	whomever was helping me before...what am I editing after downloading pptpd and openvpn?
03:03	<Fylk>	Random, how do I run that?
03:03	<wallydalla1>	ok, well goodnight everyone.   this was an interestng first time.    I wish there was better support for Wireless PCI cards.   Or I wish there was a list of cards that worked 100% PnP.
03:03	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: I will have sound afterwards?
03:03	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Ok, silly me :S  Here is my /etc/exports http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16951
03:03	<boss>	ozymandias: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
03:03	<debaser>	ozymandias: download kubuntu
03:03	<ozymandias>	no, seriously
03:03	<stefg>	!kubuntu | ozymandias
03:03	<ubotu>	ozymandias: Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
03:03	<debaser>	boss: he's just asking not to do that
03:03	<xtknight>	how do i rebuild initrd?
03:03	<eck>	mistaWAC: with openvpn you will want to read the documentation at openvpn.net, there are a lot of ways to configure your vpn
03:03	<debaser>	mkinitrd
03:04	<mistaWAC>	okay
03:04	<randomwalker>	debaser: i've never tried this, but try booting from cd, mounting your / directory, removing the cd's /bin and /usr/bin from your $PATH and replacing them with the /bin and /usr/bin on the hosed system, and run apt-get. hopefully it'll be as if you're running on the old system
03:04	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: reboot where? Put that on the terminal?
03:04	<mistaWAC>	thanks a lot
03:04	<cabajgtr>	Should I be able to Rsync one feisty install over a messed up install to fix it?
03:04	<Impaque>	VividHazE: and the IP of the client machine is..?
03:04	<debaser>	randomwalker: it's better to do a chroot, isn't it?
03:04	<randomc0de>	Fylk: open a terminal, type "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh", enter your passwork when prompted
03:04	<VividHazE>	Impaque: 192.168.1.69
03:04	<stefg>	cabajgtr: interesting experiment... let me know of the resukts :-)
03:04	<randomwalker>	debaser: yeah, good idea
03:05	<kbrooks>	So...
03:05	<Impaque>	VividHazE: and you're trying to mount the first exported dir to no avail?
03:05	<ozymandias>	no, seriously. I would like a serious answer to this, not "download a different distro/iso" that seems.... like a stupid -non-solution
03:05	<debaser>	I guess I'll try
03:05	<Yahooadam>	SMB connection failed
03:05	<debaser>	I did it to check logs but I didn't try to run upgrade-manager
03:05	<Yahooadam>	:S
03:05	<kbrooks>	I need sensible answers for a few questions for #ubuntu-trivia
03:05	<eck>	cabajgtr: there are a few files you would want to not copy over
03:05	<eck>	cabajgtr: e.g. ssh keys
03:05	<cabajgtr>	Well, I tried it, and it still booted into the old install
03:05	<Ax4>	mistaWAC, if you installed pptpd, the config will be located in /etc at /etc/pptpd.conf - you can edit it in terminal by running the command 'sudo nano -w /etc/pptpd.conf' or using the GTK text editor by 'sudo gedit /etc/pptpd.conf'
03:05	<Fylk>	Random: still no good.
03:05	<hydrozen>	Hi. Just wondering... I just upgraded to feisty from edgy... and when I enable desktop effects (compiz), window decorations don't work. Is there a quick fix for this????
03:05	<Yahooadam>	it asks me to type a password but wont accept what i put in .....
03:06	<Morpheus_74>	 Can anyone help me with a display issue?
03:06	<Morpheus_74>	 I cannot get the refresh rate to 85 Hz, when scrolling with my mouse it is choppy, and when I go to tty1,2,3,... the font is so large that I cannot see what I'm typing.
03:06	<stefg>	ozymandias: err, things are as they are. this is the only answer possible
03:06	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, what do u wanna do
03:06	<debaser>	Yahooadam: check samba services are running and configured correctly (especially wiindows group) and at last check wiring
03:06	<ozymandias>	apt-get install kde has just taken longer than the install did in the first place
03:06	<brunoUT>	yo peeps....i am trying to play the game tremulous...but when the game starts i can not see anything and its all distorted....any ideas?
03:06	<stefg>	!slow
03:06	<ubotu>	The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
03:06	<randomc0de>	how can I force firefox to use the non-msttcorefonts?
03:06	<symtab>	can anyone give me a link where i can file bug reports?
03:06	<wastrel>	!bugs >	symtab
03:06	<Stormx2>	How do I un-gz a file? Currently it is README.gz
03:06	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, what do u wanna do < cooperate pls
03:06	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Yup, well what command should I be entering?  Here is what I have been writing: sudo mount 192.168.1.66:/home/vividhaze/files /file
03:07	<brunoUT>	yo peeps....i am trying to play the game tremulous...but when the game starts i can not see anything and its all distorted....any ideas?
03:07	<kubuntu_usr>	ozymandias: that is so true
03:07	<randomwalker>	Stormx2: gunzip filename
03:07	<kbrooks>	Stormx2,gunzip
03:07	<Impaque>	Stormx2: zless README.gz
03:07	<ozymandias>	kbrooks i would like a serious answer on how I can use the install disk I have to install a desktop enviroment like KDE initially, so I dont have to apt-get install kde, and then apt-get remove all teh useless pieces of gnome
03:07	<yell0w>	hey folks, how do i find out what's running on a port ?
03:07	<randomc0de>	anyone having trouble with accessing the repository should find a mirror and change apt to use that, I switched to the easynews mirror and my speeds went up by a factor of 10
03:07	<debaser>	Stormx2: zcat README.gz
03:07	<VividHazE>	Impaque: I wrote file instead of files there, but it still says the same permission denied
03:07	<southafrikanse>	crimsun: You're still here?
03:07	<Stormx2>	Got it, thanks all
03:07	<Impaque>	yell0w: netstat -anp | grep PORTNUMBER
03:07	<eck>	randomwalker: you would have to set firefox to ignore the fonts that sites specify altogether, if a site specifies a MS font in the css then that is the font that firefox will use
03:08	<Stormx2>	debaser: Is your name a reference to the pixies song?
03:08	<yell0w>	tx Impaque
03:08	<debaser>	yell0w: nmap
03:08	<Impaque>	yell0w: np
03:08	<kubuntu_usr>	funny is how a upgrade from 6.06 takes longer and downloads more packages than the install itself o_O
03:08	<randomwalker>	eck: that wasn't me :)
03:08	<debaser>	Stormx2: yes man!
03:08	<eck>	oops
03:08	<hydrozen>	Hi. Just wondering... I just upgraded to feisty from edgy... and when I enable desktop effects (compiz), window decorations don't work. Is there a quick fix for this????
03:08	<eck>	randomc0de:
03:08	<debaser>	Stormx2: from Doolitle
03:08	<stefg>	ozymandias: are you trolling?
03:08	<ozymandias>	downloading KDE packages during install is acceptable, downloading a second 700 MB iso to do something trivial like this is not
03:08	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, we are trying to seriously aswer
03:08	<debaser>	Stormx2: besides, I think it's cool
03:08	<Stormx2>	debaser: Great album :)
03:08	<m4rk>	kooeeeeeee
03:08	<randomc0de>	eck: why was it using the non-MS font before then?
=== andy_ is now known as xtknight
03:08	<Stormx2>	Ima listen to it now
03:08	<debaser>	Stormx2: GREAT ALBUM!
03:09	<brunoUT>	yo peeps....i am trying to play the game tremulous...but when the game starts i can not see anything and its all distorted....any ideas?
03:09	<Nick_Hill>	If I change the kernel boot parameters in /etc/grub/menu.lst, when the kernel updates, the new line doesn't have the parameter. Can I make a change elsewhere so that the update system adds the boot parameter?
03:09	<eck>	randomc0de: because there are fallback fonts in the css
03:09	<kbrooks>	stefg, i wonder if he is cooperating at all
03:09	<wastrel>	ozymandias:  the ubuntu install disk doesn't contain kde packages.  you need the kubuntu install disk for that.
03:09	<eck>	randomc0de: and there is a default font as well
03:09	<kbrooks>	!repeat | brunoUT
03:09	<ubotu>	brunoUT: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
03:09	<eck>	randomc0de: look at the css for the page you are viewing
03:09	<Impaque>	VividHazE: hmmm..
03:09	<randomc0de>	eck: that makes sense, but is very annoyting
03:09	<VividHazE>	Impaque: I'm using DHCP for my network would that cause a problem?
03:09	<yell0w>	Impaque, it says list of process ids must follow p, so throw p out ?
03:09	<wastrel>	ozymandias:  so the choice is , download the kubuntu iso or install kubuntu-desktop
03:09	<Stormx2>	debaser: I can play "Here comes your man" on guitar. But anyway this is all ot and I've got work to do ;)
03:09	<brunoUT>	thanks kbrooks
03:09	<brunoUT>	people dont scroll up looking for question
03:09	<brunoUT>	genious
03:09	<zipped20x>	ok so i'm new on this whole unbuntu linux stuff and my guru just left me so i'm going to be asking ALOT of questions for a little bit
03:09	<kbrooks>	brunoUT, dont rant
03:09	<symtab>	thanks
03:10	<zipped20x>	so just let me know when i get on your nerves lol
03:10	<Fylk>	I got DVDs work, just not with menus
03:10	<debaser>	Stormx2: great!
03:10	<brunoUT>	kbrooks: STOP talking to me
03:10	<Stormx2>	brunoUT: How did you install the game?
03:10	<Impaque>	yell0w: sorry, just add t for TCP or u for UDP
03:10	<brunoUT>	yes i did storm
03:10	<randomc0de>	Fylk: check the latest version of libdvdread is installed, libdvdread3 iirc
03:10	<eck>	randomc0de: that's why when you make a website you should just choose a font family like "sans" rather than forcing your ugly fonts on people :-)
03:10	<kbrooks>	brunoUT, dont order me around :-)
03:10	<brunoUT>	but its all messed up graphically
03:10	<southafrikanse>	Is crimsun still here?
03:10	<ozymandias>	wastrel i have an active net connection during install though, why download a 700meg iso rather than the 10 meg of kde packages? and even if i install it after i install the image, i still haev to deal with gnome being installed, as i was never givien an option during the install to NOT install gnome.
03:10	<Fylk>	iirc?
03:10	<debaser>	Stormx2: a friend has a bass and I could play it (Here Comes your man)
03:10	<Stormx2>	brunoUT: How.
03:10	<Impaque>	yell0w: f.e. netstat -anpt | grep 22
03:10	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, kubuntu _does not_ total 10 mb
03:10	<feisty-beginner>	I have just created a local feisty repository using apt-mirror and launched it on my local server using apache.  other machine are able to access this local repository via apt.  However when I tried to netboot via http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz this boot image fails to retrieve from my local repository despite it can access the offic
03:10	<feisty-beginner>	ial one, what's wrong with my local repository?
03:10	<brunoUT>	through apt-get install tremulous
03:10	<ardchoille>	Fylk: iirc = If I Remember Correctly
03:11	<brunoUT>	Stormx2: through apt-get install
03:11	<kbrooks>	ozymandias, it in fact is much bigger
03:11	<Impaque>	yell0w: or even better netstat -anpt | grep :22
03:11	<ozymandias>	as i now have to remove all these silly gnome packages that are wasting disk space
03:11	<Stormx2>	debaser: I'm starting a band with this girl I know, and she's a big pixies fan. I've sung "Monkey gone to heaven" live with my friend's band
03:11	<wastrel>	ozymandias:  that's now how the installer works.
03:11	<randomc0de>	eck: the weird part was that I moved the directories to hide the fonts from firefox, and it still used them
03:11	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Am I screwed then, I was hoping to have all my files on the one computer so the other computers and laptops in the house could read it from them :(
03:11	<ozymandias>	wastrel so where is teh bugzilla to report that to?
03:11	<Impaque>	VividHazE: the only thing that comes to mind is that the user/group is preventing from mounting
03:11	<VividHazE>	I thought this network stuff would be easy enough, gah!
03:11	<NemesisD>	hi guys, when upgrading to feisty, should I use: apt-get dist-upgrade or apt-get upgrade?
03:11	<Impaque>	VividHazE: you can try doing this:
03:11	<wastrel>	!launchpad >	ozymandias
03:12	<debaser>	Stormx2: I wish I could say something like that, but I don't know much people interested in rock music because I am a classical guitar player.
03:12	<stefg>	!upgrade | NemesisD
03:12	<ubotu>	NemesisD: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
03:12	<randomc0de>	Fylk: also, go to File->Open Disc in VLC, and you can find options for DVD (With Menus) and DVD (No Menus)
03:12	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sec, i'll post the fix on pastebin.. hold on
03:12	<Ax4>	it's my opinion that a fresh install is always the best
03:12	<brunoUT>	Stormx2: through apt-get install tremulous
03:12	<VividHazE>	k
03:12	<zipped20x>	so is the reason my update files failing because everyone's updating thier files as well?
03:12	<Fylk>	Yeah, menus didn't ever open.
03:12	<Stormx2>	brunoUT: File a bug.
03:12	<yell0w>	Impaque, uhm that doesn't give me any info about which process it is
03:12	<stefg>	feisty-beginner: have you adapted your /etc/apt/sources.list, so that it point to your local repo?
03:12	<Fylk>	Wait!! it worked!
03:12	<Shadow_X>	hey guys I got a question about SYNAPTIC, so u SPM experts listen up
03:12	<brunoUT>	ummm...no?
03:12	<debaser>	Stormx2: but I listen to a lot of music and try to help friends doing a rock band. I hope it works someday, and I wish luck for your project
03:13	<hydrozen>	Hi. Just wondering... I just upgraded to feisty from edgy... and when I enable desktop effects (compiz), window decorations don't work. Is there a quick fix for this????
03:13	<Stormx2>	debaser: Ah. I've been playing since christmas... just learning chords and the odd tab... Tis fun ;)
03:13	<randomc0de>	/Fylk: give VLC a minute on commercial DVD's too - brute-force cracking that encryption key is tough!
03:13	<feisty-beginner>	stefg: yes, in the installer ,I explicitly pointed to my local repository
03:13	<Impaque>	VividHazE: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16954/
03:13	<Shadow_X>	please dont ask me to explain the whole reason I need this, but how can I FORCE Synaptic to redownload packages for reinstallation, even if it says it already has them?
03:13	<Fylk>	I love VLC.
03:13	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Trying now
03:13	<debaser>	Stormx2: very good, it's quite a great achievement for that short time.
03:13	<brunoUT>	how can i set VLC as my default player for DVDs....when i put a DVD in gay totem always comes up and cant play it
03:14	<dunstabulos_>	i have installed swat, do i need xinetd to run it?
03:14	<Impaque>	yell0w: it does. if you have sshd running, it will show the PID of the process and name (sshd)
03:14	<sanityx>	Is there a way to mount bin or cue files without burning them
03:14	<Stormx2>	debaser: You learn quick if you enjoy what you play. What kind of things do you play? I know next to nothing about classical guitar..
03:14	<stefg>	!info cdemu
03:14	<eric>	Shadow_X: Try apt-get clean. That will clear out your cached downloads.
03:14	<ubotu>	Package cdemu does not exist in feisty
03:14	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: System->Preferences->Removable Drives and Media
03:14	<Stormx2>	sanityx: Yeah. but I forget >.<
03:14	<yell0w>	Impaque, it just says tcp
03:15	<sanityx>	I could run daemon tools in wine :-P
03:15	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: Multimedia Tab
03:15	<stefg>	sanityx: there's a program called cdemu to do that. It's not in the repos, so google for it
03:15	<Shadow_X>	please dont ask me to explain the whole reason I need this, but how can I FORCE Synaptic to redownload packages for reinstallation, even if it says it already has them?
03:15	<witless>	so, am i basically screwed with Desktop Effects until nvidia fixes their driver?
03:15	<Impaque>	yell0w: you must run as root: sudo netstat -anpt
03:15	<debaser>	Stormx2: I'm studying and I'm actually playing studios of Giuliani, Villa-Lobos, Ponce and Brouwer
03:15	<brunoUT>	randomcode: thanks i just found it
03:15	<Stormx2>	Shadow_X: I think you can make apt-get do that.
03:15	<Stormx2>	Shadow_X: Have a look at the man page
03:15	<Impaque>	yell0w: are you still not getting the info, even that way?
03:15	<sanityx>	i dont like to install non repo stuff
03:15	<debaser>	Stormx2: you can listen somethings at sky.fm
03:16	<randomc0de>	witless: I've been using the SVN/experimental repository for months now and it works fine, switching to it is a bit of a pain, but not impossible
03:16	<stefg>	sanityx: then forget it
03:16	<sanityx>	mm
03:16	<brunoUT>	randomc0de: where is VLC player stored by default?
03:16	<randomc0de>	witless: command line is pretty much required though
03:16	<yell0w>	Impaque, ok, i  got it, portmap
03:16	<yell0w>	Impaque, now how should i disable portmap ?
03:16	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: stored? like the executable that you actually run?
03:16	<alienseer23>	I am looking for help trying to set up lirc, I really don't know what to do, is there a good how to?
03:16	<yell0w>	lol
03:16	<Stormx2>	debaser: I've never been much of a fan of the whole classical music thing, though as I get older I can really see it as something of an art. Peter and the wolf is about the closest I got, heh. Oh, and "A Hawk And A Hacksaw"
03:16	<brunoUT>	randomc0de: yes sir thats correct
03:16	<randomc0de>	brunoUT: you can just put "vlc" in the box instead of totem
03:16	<brunoUT>	word
03:16	<brunoUT>	thanks
03:16	<witless>	randomc0de: is there some kind of fix to the driver in SVN?
03:16	<zipped20x>	so nearly ALL of my update files are failing on me
03:17	<randomc0de>	witless: you're having trouble with the window decorator?
03:17	<zipped20x>	why is that?
03:17	<stefg>	sanityx: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Mount_ISO_script
03:17	<randomc0de>	witless: and the nvidia proprietary driver?
03:17	<Jump86>	finally got feisty upgrade to work.. time to showoff my desktop: http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/5020/screenshot100ql9.png
03:17	<sanityx>	cool
03:17	<Kevin>	hello
03:17	<debaser>	Stormx2: I don't really enjoy classical music as much as prog rock, but it's fun to play it and I think it's a good step before playing prog rock, space rock or things like that
03:17	<eck>	zipped20x: how do you mean failing?
03:17	<Impaque>	yell0w: sudo /etc/init.d/portmap stop
03:18	<Kevin>	how do i shutdown x
03:18	<witless>	randomc0de: actually the biggest problem is that when i switch away from my desktop (eg alt-f1 into terminal) and them come back, i see nothign but a black screen and the mouse pointer (which i can move around)
03:18	<Impaque>	yell0w: but it will break nfs (if you have some dirs mounted etc.)
03:18	<Leftmost>	Is there a package with restricted modules that can be compiled for/used with a custom-rolled kernel?
03:18	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  that is so tight.....how did u get all that?
03:18	<randomwalker>	Jump86: is that gdesklets?
03:18	<VividHazE>	Impaque: That didn't work either, but I found out that if I type the su command and enter my root password it says it won't let me too, is that normal?  When I enter the password for sudo it works ok
03:18	<ardchoille>	Kevin: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
03:18	<yell0w>	Impaque, sorry, i mean remove it from booting ?
03:18	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  with the MAC OS icons on top
03:18	<corevette>	what is everyone's favorite linux game?
03:18	<Kevin>	ardchoille, thankyou
03:18	<Jump86>	brunoUT, it's gdesklets, yes
03:18	<Opiate>	Jump86:  Does Feisty look like MAC OS freshly installed or is that a theme of some sort ?
03:19	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  what is that?

03:19	<Ax4>	hey guys, how do i find the path to open ssl?
03:19	<debaser>	Stormx2: I actually enjoy any music which is about more than selling. That's rock, prog rock, jazz, blues, tango, and a great and large etc
03:19	<Impaque>	VividHazE: yes, it's normal for ubuntu. ubuntu uses sudo instead of su
03:19	<Stormx2>	debaser: My friend is a big prog rock fan... well actually I'm not sure. my knowledge of genres goes blurry with alt/prog. I guess you're talking about 20 minute songs with offbeat rhythms?
03:19	<zipped20x>	eck: i mean almost ALL of the files that's downloading says failed
03:19	<witless>	randomc0de: yes
03:19	<Jump86>	brunoUT, sudo apt-get install gdesklets
03:19	<Lam_>	what file do i put a command into to have it run at startup?
03:19	<randomc0de>	witless: try installing and running beryl-manager
03:19	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sudo uses your user password, while su uses root password, which is disabled by default
03:19	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  is that wheere u get the weather from too?
03:19	<witless>	hmm ok
03:19	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Ok thanks.  So am I screwed for networking then? :S
03:20	<eck>	zipped20x: i think it is just because the servers are slow right now
03:20	<witless>	i thought that was actually less stable than "desktop effects"
03:20	<Impaque>	VividHazE: what do you mean?
03:20	<Impaque>	VividHazE: btw did that line work?
03:20	<debaser>	Stormx2: well, there's a JethroTull disc called "Thick as a Brick" which has one track, 42 minutes long, and it's just orgasmic.
03:20	<Jump86>	brunoUT, weather is an app for gdesklets for not a default one.. i had to get it from some other website.. google for "goodweather gdesklets" and youll find it
03:20	<eck>	zipped20x: with the feisty release, and all
03:20	<zipped20x>	eck: so should i wait and if so how long?
03:20	<randomc0de>	witless: I'm not sure what they've done with the "desktop effects" but the amount of options there are far too few for me
03:20	<VividHazE>	Impaque:  No it didn't work, same Permission Denied error. Does it make a difference the client is a laptop using Wireless?
03:20	<brunoUT>	Jump86:  sounds good
03:20	<tgm4883_>	how do you change a networking device from eth1 to eth0?
03:21	<Impaque>	VividHazE: no
03:21	<debaser>	Stormx2: but Pink Floyd, for example, is a high quality and known prog rock band, with offbeat rhythms
03:21	<eck>	zipped20x: I'd just let it run in the background... you can also hold out a few days until things clear up

03:21	<VividHazE>	Impaque: Being able to transfer files across my network is nearly the only thing that doesn't work for me, its not an essential thing, but its pretty cool and so annoying it doesn't work
03:21	<Fin>	corvette: armagetron advanced and tux racer are two free good ones, you can go buy doom or something if you want though
03:21	<Kevin>	ardchoille. how to I get to comand line now, its just got a blinken cursor after *running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)
03:22	<dimeotane>	fin: don't forget tremulous
03:22	<ardchoille>	Kevin: CNTRL+ALT+F2  (or F3, F4, F5, F6)
03:22	<zipped20x>	eck: yea but letting it run in the backround (being on dial-up) wouldn't almost all of them fail?
03:22	<debaser>	ardchille: you should call "control" key CTRL
03:22	<vik>	I've just upgraded from an older ubuntu via backup and re-install, and I want to get my evolution settings back. I have all of the dot files from the home folder, and have copied .evolution and .gconf/apps/evolution, but when i start it up it still wants to go through the setup process. Any ideas?
03:22	<Fin>	dimeotane: never heard of that one to be honest *downloads*
03:22	<VividHazE>	Impaque: And I know it isn't linux fault its my fault, if a linux expert were right here it would probably be working in 10 seconds, lol.  Anyway if you've no more advice I'll head on here, thanks for the time you spent trying.
03:23	<Kevin>	ardchoille thanks again
03:23	<ardchoille>	debaser: Ah, yes, thanks.
03:23	<dimeotane>	corevette: have you tried tremulous yet? it's the crown jewel of ubuntu games if you ask me
03:23	<ardchoille>	Kevin: You're welcome :)
03:23	<Stormx2>	debaser: Pink Floyd are great heh. I love a lot of their stuff.
03:23	<holycow>	don't forget your .evolution folder too
03:23	<Impaque>	VividHazE: is nfs service started and all? is portmap started on the client? gimme some logs
03:23	<corevette>	yes i have dimeotane...doesn't have enough strategy for me

03:24	<Ax4>	hey guys, how do i find the path to open ssl?
03:24	<eck>	zipped20x: although i guess if nearly all of them are failing you might as well just hold out
03:24	<dimeotane>	corevette: the strategy is in the base layout... try being a builder
03:24	<debaser>	Stormx2: they're just great, I have the entire discography, I'm a great fun and I recently had alucinations in a concert of Dark Side of the moon of Roger Waters, jaja, really great
03:24	<owh>	Has anyone got any suggestions on where I go to learn more about how iocharsets work? Specifically, I'm trying to learn how it relates to file system mounting.
03:24	<eck>	Ax4: what component of openssl?
03:24	<zipped20x>	eck: for a day or two or four?
03:24	<debaser>	Ax2: try something like pkg-config
03:24	<Impaque>	VividHazE: sudo tail -f /var/log/messages while mounting, it should show the error
03:24	<kkathman>	!sound
03:24	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

03:37	<Fujitsu>	WrektAA: Arrow keys.
03:37	<Pelo>	WrektAA,   arrows,  tab key , the usual stuff
03:37	<Jordan_U_>	WrektAA, arrow keys to switch channels and levels, "m" to mute / unmute
03:38	<Intangir>	on edgy it worked out of the box, but on fiesty, if i use the easier wizard it doesnt work, and if i use the old config looking stuff it also still doesnt work, neither set the iwconfig options for the wifi card
03:38	<debaser>	Fujitsu: I upgraded to feisty but the upgrade was broken and rendered the system unbooteable, now I can't use a live CD to rerun update-manager, or at least ubuntu 5.10 liveCD doesn't work.
03:38	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	um HALP my wired ethernet NIC was working... but it quit.. so I reformatted... now it says its an unknown device
03:38	<Impaque>	VividHazE: you didn't catch the errors :S
03:38	<Fin>	Alon_005: Click on it, and where it says "device:" copy it into google :P
03:38	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	:C
03:38	<rookiehwm>	you reformatted because your NIC stopped working?
03:38	<debaser>	I've got to work.
03:38	<debaser>	Fujitsu: any ideas?
03:38	<Alon_005>	Fin: It says "Unknown"
03:38	<boss>	When I use a kickstart file generated from system-config-kickstart, I run into issues with the partitioner. I'm heavily leaning towards filing a bug report, but I want to make sure that this isn't all in my head first.
03:38	<rookiehwm>	i bought a new car because my tire was flat!
03:38	<mlocker>	Hi !
03:38	<tom_>	GionnyBoss, the only way to get help in here is to a.) be a girl b.) beg for 4 hours c.) insult/say windows is better.... I am just frustrated because I get ennough crap from friends for using this and I am always trying ot defend ubuntu but every time I get a problem they just give me stuff like "why do you even mess with that".... now i finally gut beryl to work but then I needed to change my resolution which I tried to change through the auto reconfig for th
03:38	<rookiehwm>	debaser: with all the time you've spent here you could have done a fresh install
03:38	<tom_>	e xorg.conf file but that wasn't working for me (even though I have a nividia graphics card) so then i finally manaully just edited the file xorg.cof to get my resolution to 1400 x 900 so i could read something ... but then beryl stops working on me. so I go back and tried to but it back... so i have the bad resolution agin, but still I don't have beryl working and now my computer is running very choppy. So now I am looking at reformating my computer for the 4t
03:38	<tom_>	h time in 2 days to reintall fiesty one last time to try to go through the frustrating process that i have had from using this.

03:39	<boss>	Has anyone seen an issue with kickstart regarding partitioning?
03:39	<Korvak>	Anyone know why I cannot turn my resolution higher than 1024? I installed the nvidia driver in the "restricted drivers" area.
03:39	<Fujitsu>	debaser: What does it do when you try to boot it?
03:39	<boss>	tom_: "Be a girl"?
03:39	<Fin>	Alon_005: hmm, then try just searching the name in the menu (AT-sound or something you said earlier aye?)
03:39	<Fujitsu>	tom_: Please don't flood the channel. Also, be family friendly and pleasant.
03:39	<Pelo>	boss,  check the forum , it might tell you of a fix or if someone else has had this problem
03:39	<tom_>	Fujitsu,  that was all text
03:39	<boss>	tom_: I have had similar issues with 1440 x 900.
03:39	<debaser>	rookiehwm: no.
03:39	<KevinOoO>	hello, how do i edit grub
03:39	<rookiehwm>	no?
03:39	<tom_>	boss,  try changing name to cheerleaderX14 and asking a question
03:39	<sh00t1>	any how to's to install RealMagic DVD Decoder Card on ubuntu 6.10 can't find anything
03:40	<rookiehwm>	erm, yes?
03:40	<Alon_005>	Fin: So, I have to search for "AT-style speaker sound" on google.
03:40	<johnm_>	I heard it was possible to install flash9 on a 64bit version of firefox, is this true?

03:40	<johnm_>	Or do I need a 32bit firefox
03:40	<kbrooks>	tom_: so? u wrote it
03:40	<NemesisD>	is there a way to run a program as root at the alt+f2 menu?
03:40	<debaser>	Fujitsu: it gets stucked at the splash screen, and there's no error but some INT faults or something like that
03:40	<kbrooks>	tom_: in here ] 
03:40	<megafauna>	hey, i downloaded the iso and burnt it. there wasn't an upgrade button, just plain install. Can I only upgrage thru the update Manager?
03:40	<Fin>	Alon_005:  aye, but if that doesnt come up with anything useful and related to linux, try linuxquestions or ubuntuforums
03:40	<Korvak>	Can anyone help me with my nVIDIA driver? I am unable to go higher than 1024.
03:40	<tom_>	kbrooks, ??
03:40	<cheerleaderX14>	I'm trying to get kickstart to work, but I'm facing a lot of issues related to getting post installation scripts to work.
03:40	<debaser>	Fujitsu: there are no kernel panics nor GRUB errors.
03:40	<kbrooks>	tom_: therefore, u r responsible for its content
03:40	<cheerleaderX14>	If anyone could help me out, it would a) help me out and b) prove tom_'s theory
03:41	<Alon_005>	Fin:  Ok then. Thanks for your help, Fin.
03:41	<Jordan_U_>	KevinOoO, You need to edit the file /boot/grub/menu.lst What do you want to change in particular?
03:41	<GionnyBoss>	tom_: if you start to beg and insult, you have less probability to get helped. I personally always get helped when I need something. You have to know how to write your question well, and you have to behave well, keeping in mind that people here is helping you free, and you have to be respectful
03:41	<Fin>	Alon_005:  Np, sorry for being vague :P
03:41	<NemesisD>	cheerleaders use linux?
03:41	<rimtech>	why is the multimedia applications section of the ubuntu wiki missing???how will I know which player to install or how to do it?
03:41	<megafauna>	Korvak: I used the Envy script when I installed my nvidea drivers and there were no problems
03:41	<debaser>	Fujitsu: I'm not able to correctly diagnose the problem. What should I do?
03:41	<delmorep>	BIG FAVOR! will someone with a cleanish Feisty install check Synaptic and see if 'libwxgtk2.6-0' is installed by default?  ive downloaded so many headers and whatnot im not sure... trying to write a compile howto and wanna make sure im not leaving something out
03:41	<calculator>	i've tried burning the ubuntu iso onto a cd-r 3 times, and all 3 times, it has failed.  how can i check whether the problem is with the CD-R drive?
03:41	<Fin>	if christians can use linux i dont see why cheerleaders cant...
03:41	<Korvak>	Megafauna ... will this envy script work with 7.0.4. Where can I find it?
03:41	<cheerleaderX14>	GionnyBoss: By that logic, Windows support is superior and when people complain about support, you should admit it.
03:41	<tom_>	kbrooks, all i did was what people told me t do
03:41	<mzaza>	guys, whenever i try to open a movie with totem while the compiz is on i see a black screen. any ideas?

03:42	<cheerleaderX14>	If it's incredibly numbnutsingly obviously, you usually get a response in here. Otherwise, I rarely see anyone get help.
03:42	<Korvak>	megafauna: thanks.

03:43	<ardchoille>	KevinOoO: I make it a habit of using the repos first. If the app/tool is not there, then I use other means.

03:43	<tom_>	kbrooks, troll?
03:43	<Pelo>	tom_, sorry to hear you are having such difficulties but please remember that all the ppl here are just users like you, who volunteer their skill and knowledge of the system,  it we can't help you with something it's probably because we donT' know , so your options are to google, try the forum and figure it out on your own,  or alternatively I beleive canonical offers commercial support for a reasonnable fee.   and do bare in mind that I am n
03:43	<Pelo>	ot being sarcastic.
03:43	<debaser>	Fujitsu: I've got to work, pls, if you can help me now
03:43	<GionnyBoss>	tom_: if people don't answer you, you have to be patient. Probably they don't know how to answer or they are busy. And remember that on these days, with feisty stable out, there's a big mess here
03:43	<Jordan_U_>	calculator, So you want to know if there is a problem reading the CD on boot? Do you see anything at all when you try to boot from CD?
03:43	<Fin>	calculator:  Try k3b? :)
03:43	<delmorep>	mzaza: you might try beryl instead -- its in the repos now, remove compiz first.... ive never had any problems with beryl... but i had so many problems with compiz :( sometimes the close-X's on progams dont work... similar black screen problems that youve had too
03:44	<NobleCommerc1>	this is a really dumb one, how do I specify the search directory for glslideshow?
03:44	<WrektAA>	How do I change the Card I edit in terminal in Alsamixer?
03:44	<calculator>	Jordan_U_: no. I want to know whether my CD burning drive is the problem
03:44	<mzaza>	Ok, any ideas why the .asf movies runs very slow on the totem very slowly?
03:44	<delmorep>	plus compiz looks shoddy sometimes.... the wobble effect is way contrived
03:44	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, very interesting >:)
03:44	<Jordan_U_>	calculator, Then check to see if the burned CD matches the md5 checksum
03:44	<megafauna>	mzaza: use vlc media player. it is the schinit
03:44	<KevinOoO>	ardchoille, ok its just that I think glx is older than the 9755 version, but then again I dont know
03:44	<justin64>	Help! All the Virtual consoles are outputting the message: "hdb: drive not ready for command". hdb is the CDROM and there's no disk in the drive. It seems (???) like Linux is constantly trying to mount it!

03:45	<NemesisD>	is there any way to run something as root at the run application menu?

03:45	<megafauna>	Korvak: I can't tell you more than what I've said. You press a few buttons and it upgrades.
03:45	<calculator>	Jordan_U_: i don't need to check the burned cd, because all of the burning programs I've used say that the burn process failed
03:45	<Jordan_U_>	!sudo | NemesisD
03:45	<megafauna>	It will probably work though, but don't quote me on that

03:46	<tom_>	Pelo, thanks for your response... I am just frustrated we have our exams winding up here in ann arbor and I just needed a place to vent... its just not a good time for me to have to reintall the operating system... and yes i realize that its people like this who make ubuntu sucessfull and that I have no one to  blame but myself for the problems... its just frustating and a i am blowing off steam
03:46	<orange1>	how do i setup the startup programs for when i login ?
03:46	<Pelo>	megafauna,  you can only upgrade from cd if you have downloaded the alternate install cd,

03:47	<moDumass>	ok, thanks
03:47	<tom_>	well i am going to go back to 6.06
03:48	<tom_>	time to reformat...
03:48	<tom_>	:(
03:48	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: what do you want to bind it to
03:48	<Pelo>	tom_,  try just running ubuntu without the eye candy for a while , it's still pretty nice,   you donT' need beryl to have a working comp,  and you can play around with it later when you donT' have so much on your plate
03:48	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, alt+f3 makes sense to me
03:48	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: if its a standard app you can do it in keyboard shortcuts
03:48	<NemesisD>	okay cool
03:48	<vik>	which is better for feisty: automatix or easyubuntu?
03:49	<ardchoille>	!automatix
03:49	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
03:49	<randomwalker>	vik: easyubuntu
03:49	<eternalswd>	anyone know where I can get the High Contrast icon set, it appears to have disappeared after upgrading to feisty
03:49	<Jordan_U_>	NobleCommerc1, It is much harder than it should be ( due to a stubborn gnome developer ) you need to edit the apropriate .desktop file
03:49	<Pelo>	vik,  learn to install packages yourself,  you'll  learn a lot and save yourself some headaches later on
03:49	<blazemonger>	when will the molecule screensaver ever work?

03:49	<blazemonger>	is there ever going to be a fix
03:49	<tom_>	Pelo,  yeahh university of michigan enging exams make me stress out
03:49	<vik>	Pelo: I know how to do that; I'm just a bit lazy
03:49	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, In what way does it not work?
03:49	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, keyboard shortcuts doesn't seem to have a way to add new shortcuts

03:50	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: that's why i asked what you wanted to bind it _to_
03:50	<moDumass>	thanks, so im adding a launcher, where would i find the installed app?
03:50	<Korvak>	Ok -- after attempting to install an nVIDIA driver 3-different ways, and none of them allowing me to go higher than 1024 resolution, I'd hate to say it but, it's MUCH easier to install a driver over Windows XP.
03:50	<blazemonger>	when i cclick on the molecule screensaver, it says 'loading molecules' then the mouse cursor turns all black
03:50	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: if its a nonstandard target, you can do it with gconf-editor

03:51	<Jordan_U_>	kmizeta, What card do you have?
03:51	<moDumass>	kmizeta see my previouse answer

03:51	<Meshezabeel>	I have xscreensaver start at startup, since upgrading from 6.10 to 7.04, the xscreensaver banner sometimes stays on my screen, but is just a ghost banner, ie. if I try to click on it, it is actually what's behind it that gets clicked on, there is no way to get rid of this banner except log out and log back in.

03:52	<NobleCommerc1>	Jordan_U_: I don't even HAVE a .desktop file, any docs you could point me to so i could set one up?
03:52	<Jordan_U_>	kmizeta, Have you enabled the nvidia driver in the restricted driver manager?
03:52	<moDumass>	man i sound like i have done this a few times
03:52	<kmizeta>	im reading... thanks
03:52	<kmizeta>	yes...
03:52	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, i only use metacity when i need to play videos, because for some reason beryl screws up all the videos i play
03:52	<Fujitsu>	NobleCommerc1: The *.desktop files are in /usr/share/applications.

03:53	<Kix>	justin64: ?? Maybe some process is waiting for a CD? Have you tried inserting one? - May keep it happy... Or just reboot? Or is this a constant problem?
03:53	<blazemonger>	dont know why..i have a rage 128 with 128 mb memory
03:53	<NemesisD>	blazemonger, im sorry to hear that :(
03:53	<moDumass>	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:53	<alcane>	Fujitsu: supported? and "fora" as in a room?
03:53	<eternalswd>	alcane, flash only works on 32-bit afaik
03:53	<kbrooks>	Please read before you get Swiftfox or use it again:  http://www.getswiftfox.org/
03:53	<blazemonger>	bout what NemesisD?
03:53	<Fujitsu>	alcane: fora == plural of forum == ubuntuforums.org
03:53	<blazemonger>	the rage 128 is a good card too
03:53	<NemesisD>	blazemonger, that it doesn't work
03:53	<msand>	Took me some digging to get Beryl working on my nvidia, but it looks great now
03:53	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, i have config editor open now, we can just try metacity
03:53	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: There are methods to get it to run in a 32-bit chroot, but they're entirely unsupported.
03:53	<kalifornia909>	anyone have any idea why ubuntu isnt writing a partition table to a raid array
03:53	<Korvak>	modumass, I will try adding my resolutions to xorg.conf right now.
03:53	<blazemonger>	NemesisD: beryl i could care less.i would love the molecule saver to work
03:54	<moDumass>	but before you mess with it do this sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:54	<wastrel>	alcane:  i presume he means ubuntuforums.org
03:54	<KevinOoO>	how do i install a beryl theme, I have bery-ubuntu
03:54	<tonio_>	i dont know
03:54	<blazemonger>	then again i didnt pay that much for my videocard in the first place
03:54	<NemesisD>	blazemonger, the what now? that sounds dangerous
03:54	<moDumass>	korvak, il open a channel and show you what someone showed me
03:54	<blazemonger>	rage 128 for 30
03:54	<DanZ3>	has any one gotten the "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" thing fixed? ive tried doing what people said on the forums and nothings worked so far
03:54	<mjr>	kalifornia909, assuming software raid, they're not traditionally partitionable
03:54	<blazemonger>	whats dangerous?
03:54	<NobleCommerc1>	and what do I need to add to my glslideshow.desktop file?
03:54	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: ok, in global_keybindings set run_command_1 to <Alt>F3
03:54	<moDumass>	korvak join #resfix
03:54	<Korvak>	moDumass, I added 1920x1200, i am rebooting.
03:54	<dauoalagio2>	i'm getting this error and have no idea what to do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=392854
03:54	<blazemonger>	i just can never find a distro that will run rosegarden with full midi support
03:55	<jeah_>	Can anyone recommend a place to find information on why I am unable to set a passive or active trip point for my inspiron 8500?
03:55	<NobleCommerc1>	i just want it to randomly show pictures from my personal pic directory
03:55	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: and in keybindings_commands set command_1 to whatever command
03:55	<alcane>	Fujitsu: thx, i've been there and the only error I've gotten is it not working. I've done installs of nspluginwrapper, alien, and every library I can find as well as copying every translated deb and libray into any directory that says that it even MIGHT need it. But, thx anyway
03:55	<justin64>	Kix: it seems to be a constan problem. on the X server I get an Audo CD icon, but there's no disk inserted.
03:55	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, done
03:55	<blazemonger>	i'm willing to pay for a distro which will run rosegarden and which will configure my midi drivers for me
03:55	<Jordan_U_>	NobleCommerc1, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=198809
03:55	<blazemonger>	i think its cuz my computer's slow
03:55	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: does it work?
03:55	<Pelo>	NobleCommerc1,  I believe what you need is f-spot
03:55	<KevinOoO>	how do i install a beryl theme, I have bery-ubuntu
03:55	<blazemonger>	i have a pentium 4 2.4ghz with 768mb of memory
03:55	<Fujitsu>	blazemonger: MIDI is a touchy issue, unfortunately.
03:55	<eternalswd>	Fujitsu, yes, but alcane said 64-bit verion of firefox, not firefox on 64-bit, and that's what I was referring to
03:55	<Pelo>	KevinOoO,  try asking in #beryl
03:56	<KevinOoO>	ooh thanks
03:56	<NobleCommerc1>	thanks for the help
03:56	<randomwalker>	KevinOoO: #ubuntu-effects
03:56	<Fujitsu>	eternalswd: Oh, true... nspluginwrapper should solve that, but apparently not.
03:56	<blazemonger>	Fujitsu: well i would pay someone for a computer which has everything i need for midi
03:56	<dudu1982>	hi!
03:56	<Fujitsu>	Hi dudu1982.
03:56	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, nope, lemme try in metacity
03:56	<dudu1982>	can someone help me?
03:56	<blazemonger>	i like rosegarden's simple interface
03:56	<msand>	KevinOoO, extract it to /usr/share/emerald/themes/<directoryfornewtheme>
03:56	<Fujitsu>	!helpme
03:56	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
03:56	<chrissturm>	does feisty not support lilo?
03:56	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, works in metacity :/
03:57	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: It does, but grub is generally used instead.
03:57	<dudu1982>	it's a long one..
03:57	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, You could find the developers responsible for midi hardware support and donate testing time / money / hardware ( they can't make it work if they don't have it :)
03:57	<Fujitsu>	dudu1982: Nothing abnormal.
03:57	<dudu1982>	hehehe :)
03:57	<randomwalker>	NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
03:57	<blazemonger>	Jordan_U_:  i wouldnt mind even that
03:57	<chrissturm>	Fujitsu: but why do i get this error? update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic The provided postinst hook script [/sbin/update-grub]  could not be run.
03:58	<rbrtoclto>	some of my keys are behaving very strangely.. to get ` or ' I have to press the key then hit the spacebar
03:58	<blazemonger>	thing is intel's drivers for my soundcard only run from redhat and suse and it's this sh script with this wiierd   scrambled letters
03:58	<Fujitsu>	chrissturm: Try removing the grub package.
03:58	<NemesisD>	randomwalker, beryl is a cruel mistress
=== William is now known as wil_syd
03:58	<kalifornia909>	is there a boot manager that will boot to a software raid array
03:59	<rbrtoclto>	some of my keys are behaving very strangely.. to get ` or ' I have to press the key then hit the spacebar <-- this happens both in X and also from a standard tty
03:59	<wil_syd>	Anyone using mt-daapd ? Which has to start first.. avahi or mt-daapd ?
03:59	<chrissturm>	Fujitsu: i dont have grub installed
04:00	<Kix>	justin64: Whats the output from 'mount'?
04:00	<rbrtoclto>	so I guess it's a system configuration thing?
04:00	<nils_>	It looks like nobody has found a solution for the mouse not working with Feisty on VirtualPC. Is is possible to revert the kernel from 2.6.20 to 2.6.17, or would that be a bad thing?
04:00	<Pelo>	rbrtoclto,  this occors on my keyb to because those signs are intended to go on top of other letters
04:00	<msand>	I'm trying to record audio streams, but can't seem to get audacity to record the output of my sound card.  Tried all the options for Recording Device in Preferences.. no luck.
04:00	<Jordan_U_>	blazemonger, Best be is probably to file a bug report at bugs.ubuntu.com and, if needed, offer your hardware for testing or to the developers. I would also suggest helping with testing Gutsy when it starts coming out as it is easier to encorperate changes early on
04:00	<tehquickness>	how do you mount a cd image in ubuntu?
04:00	<Kix>	justin64: Look for something like: /dev/scd0 on /media/cdrom0 type iso9660 (ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=luke)

=== _aleX-xx is now known as aleX-xx

04:02	<Pelo>	sky_shark,  we don'T support automatix here
04:02	<ardchoille>	!automatix
04:02	<sky_shark>	oh okay
04:02	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
04:02	<justin64>	Kix: there's no listing of hdb or scd0
04:02	<dudu1982>	linux inst..

04:03	<rbrtoclto>	pelo: sweet, that's done the trick :)
04:03	<rbrtoclto>	I had dead keys turned on
04:03	<BSG76>	backend refuses to allow my frontend to connect
04:03	<rbrtoclto>	I'm guessing that's what that is
04:03	<sky_shark>	so do you guys know how I can make my ubuntu read and write to tmy windows partion?
04:03	<sky_shark>	i can read it
04:03	<KevinOoO>	well tell your backend to tell your frontend to get his ass in gear
04:03	<tuxplorer>	the update manager is downloading at a very slow rate.. how can I increase the speed? is there a way to ask it to download multiple packages parallely?
04:03	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 and type my name once you are there so it beeps and know you are there

04:04	<moDumass>	just seeing what that does
04:04	<Tom47>	BSG76 i have a feeling this i so specialised a use as to warrant the use of the specialised didtribution
04:04	<eternalswd>	xtknight, does "ls --color=auto" work?
04:04	<BSG76>	my mythtv settop has been working amazingly for last 4 years now :)
04:04	<xtknight>	eternalswd, yes it does
04:04	<rbrtoclto>	xt: had any problems?  there was a race condition between some scripts in the beta that caused 9/10 boots to fail, I've only booted twice running feisty release and one has failed :(
04:04	<Tom47>	BSG76 oops sorry you are the expert :)
04:04	<wil_syd>	sky_shark: install ntfs-config

04:05	<sky_shark>	okay i will
04:05	<rbrtoclto>	I rebooted and it was fine
04:05	<xtknight>	rbrtoclto, nope not any problems with it
04:05	<eternalswd>	xtknight, which shell are you using?
04:05	<xtknight>	rbrtoclto, besides the fact that deleting a raid array is difficult
04:05	<xtknight>	eternalswd, bash
04:05	<BSG76>	lol been using myth since early versions .. I just don't know how it is setup in ubuntu :) ... normally use gentoo .. love ubuntu though :)

04:05	<chrissturm>	heres a paste of my error message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16956/
04:06	<eternalswd>	xtknight, then I would suggest putting in .bashrc the following: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
04:06	<BSG76>	thanks ubotu .. I visited that already .. it's very basic at best :)
04:06	<BSG76>	but thanks
04:06	<xtknight>	eternalswd, thanks.  another user in ##linux suggested basicalyl the same thing
04:06	<xtknight>	wonder how it got otherwise?
04:06	<zce>	is it possible to make NetworkManager in feisty automatically connect to the "wired" network? it is (and will always be) the only possible network
04:06	<xtknight>	ubuntu is that by default, no?
04:06	<BSG76>	anyone know of any other one?
04:07	<Tom47>	BSG76 where iare the best howtos for it?
04:07	<xtknight>	eternalswd, hrm i dont have a .bashrc.
04:07	<eternalswd>	xtknight, maybe the system configuration file for bash changed during an upgrade?
04:07	<xtknight>	eternalswd, this is kinda weird, how do i get the default .bashrc?
04:07	<BSG76>	well I have accumulated some experience over the years ..
04:07	<xtknight>	eternalswd, well i was juggling my /home folder around on diff partitions
04:07	<asdfasdf>	nibsa1242b it didnt work
04:08	<delmorep>	Question: After I compile a program via './configure && make' and 'sudo make install' -- how do I uninstall? just delete the executable in /opt ???
04:08	<rbrtoclto>	I run a couple of KDE apps under Gnome (Amarok, Kaffeine) and they look pretty horrible because I've disabled font hinting, but the KDE apps are still using hinting.. where can I turn that off?  I've tried qt3-config already but no dice
04:08	<Jordan_U_>	zce, Just set up the wired connection as a "manual configuration"
04:08	<J-_>	ah yeah, Gallery on Ubuntuforums is what I was looking for =D
04:08	<BSG76>	however my lack of knowledge of ubuntu is surely haunting me right now :)
04:08	<J-_>	err wrong channel lmao
04:08	<Impaque>	delmorep: you can sudo make uninstall
04:08	<xtknight>	eternalswd, is there a universal bashrc?
04:08	<kbrooks>	kay...
04:08	<dudu1982>	nibsa1242b, i'm in your private window can u respond plz?
04:08	<kbrooks>	Please read before you get Swiftfox or use it again:  http://www.getswiftfox.org/
04:08	<Impaque>	delmorep: (if the Makefile has that) or manually delete files it installed across the system
04:08	<eternalswd>	xtknight, default should be /etc/bash.bashrc so "cp /etc/bash.bashrc ~/.bashrc" should get you on your way
04:08	<BSG76>	thanks guys .. if I figure it out I will find someone to post it or add it to the site
04:09	<xtknight>	eternalswd, or..where is the skeleton for adduser ?
04:09	<dauoalagio2>	hello i cannot get my nvidia geforce4 mx 440 working on feisty
04:09	<nibsa1242b>	dudu1982 you can't send priviate msg unless you are registered
04:09	<delmorep>	Impaque: doh, i think i deleted the 'make' folder
04:09	<dudu1982>	ohh
04:09	<Kix>	justin64: 'mount hdb' do anything?
=== ChaoticGoo1 is now known as ChaoticGood
04:09	<dudu1982>	sorry for the stupid qu but do i reg?
04:09	<xtknight>	eternalswd, interesting, that didnt do it
04:09	<zero88>	What are and how do you fix checksum errors???
04:10	<Impaque>	delmorep: it's np, you can recreate that by running ./configure there, even without make install or such
04:10	<cornel1>	I'm running dapper on an AMD 64. To upgrade, I would have to go to edgy, then fiesty?
04:10	<Impaque>	delmorep: did you use any specific ./configure flags?
04:10	<nibsa1242b>	zero88 you'll have to re dl or re burn the disk
04:10	<poomped>	Wow, I haven't used IRC in a long time
04:10	<msand>	zero88: that means the file you downloaded is corrupt.  Try downloading it again
04:10	<zce>	Jordan_U_, how? what do you mean? in Manual configuration, theres the "wired" connection on the list of connections.. what do i have to do then?
04:10	<Kix>	justin64: sorry... not that
04:10	<eternalswd>	xtknight, well you likely need to still add the alias line to .bashrc now: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
04:10	<zero88>	nibsal1242b msand ok thanks
04:11	<Fujitsu>	zero88: Before downloading it again, check the MD5sum of the image:
04:11	<delmorep>	Impaque: nope, it was the cleanest compile possible, 4 steps
04:11	<Fujitsu>	!md5sum | zero88
04:11	<ubotu>	zero88: To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM for more
04:11	<zero88>	Fujitsu its a game. its a .run file
04:11	<xtknight>	eternalswd, so the default in Feisty is no colors?
04:11	<eternalswd>	xtknight, and then reopen gnome-terminal or it won't register
04:11	<xtknight>	eternalswd, very interesting
04:11	<cornel1>	!upgrade
04:11	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
04:11	<Jordan_U_>	zce, Turn off roaming mode
04:11	<xtknight>	eternalswd, gotcha it works great now
04:11	<Impaque>	delmorep: then just do whatever you did, but instead of make install, type make uninstall
04:11	<rbrtoclto>	anyone know how to change font hinting preferences for KDE apps?

04:14	<dager>	Johnny_: yes
04:14	<xtknight>	Johnny_, yes if your controller/bios does
04:14	<rbrtoclto>	I'll try in there

04:14	<sc0tch>	worked perfect, thank you xtknight.
04:14	<rbrtoclto>	so far Feisty has been way less painful than Edgy to get "just right"
04:14	<blazemonger>	who knows someone who can build a Digital Audio Workstation for me?
04:14	<Impaque>	delmorep: well, i learned my share from README files and ./configure --help.. also, reading the Makefile (after ./configure) gives a lot of hints
04:15	<blazemonger>	that uses professional toools like rosegarde
04:15	<xtknight>	sc0tch, check out the ubuntu "master kernel thread" on the ubuntuforums (works great for me all the time)
04:15	<xtknight>	if you're building a kernel..
04:15	<tehquickness>	can ubuntu mount an mdf image?
04:15	<Fujitsu>	tehquickness: Not directly, but mdf2iso can convert it to an ISO.
04:15	<delmorep>	Impaque: I hear ya, I guess the options are dependent on the program afterall, I will investigate new configurations now that I know how to uninstall
04:15	<tehquickness>	ok I will try that
04:16	<Tom47>	!avahi
04:16	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about avahi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:16	<eternalswd>	dudu1982, if you already have a 20gb partition set apart for linux, then just install to that partition.  you'll need to reformat that partition to ext3 if you haven't already (the install disc should take care of that). and you need a small partition set aside for swap.  the partition for windows shouldn't be touched
04:16	<locke1689>	hey, does anyone have an HDBits account?
04:16	<Impaque>	delmorep: ofcourse, they are different for each program almost.. some of the programs will not configure without additional ./configure flags etc.. README should point that out..
04:17	<dauoalagio2>	how can i share folders wirelessly between two ubuntu computers?
04:17	<cornel1>	The command: gksu "update-manager -c" ,  that will use the appropriate version, that is, use 64  bit?
04:17	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, but I dont see what is wrong with them?
04:17	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh works well, but it might not be quite what you're looking for
04:18	<Jordan_U_>	cornel1, Yes
04:18	<delmorep>	Impaque: Ive used nothing but Ubuntu for almost a year, im just now starting to understand how useful the terminal is.... wget is awesome!  thanks for the information
04:18	<Impaque>	delmorep: np ;)
04:18	<dauoalagio2>	dager, one can't start x, so i am trying to back everything up
04:18	<cornel1>	Thanks  Jordan_U_
04:18	<dager>	dauoalagio2: ssh is completely command-line, unless you get a frontend
04:18	<sky_shark>	i installed the ntfs-config tool but it only lets me select an external device and grays out the internal device
=== cornel1 is now known as cornell
04:18	<Jordan_U_>	delmorep, wget -c for bad connections ( will keep re-trying ) :)
04:18	<sky_shark>	option

04:19	<locke1689>	also, kernel 2.6.*.11, that break anyone elses ethernet card?
04:19	<locke1689>	like it worked... then it didnt
04:19	<dauoalagio2>	msand, no gui - x won't start,
04:19	<cornell>	Know any problems with Edgy or Fiesty for 64bit?
04:19	<locke1689>	still cant get it fixed, just running in .10
04:19	<lbci_irc>	tda9887.ko is missing on my machine after update... has it been moved/obseleted/forgotten?
04:19	<msand>	ah, okay.  Well, you can use samba for it.
04:19	<jimmygoon>	HEY! FEISTY ROCKS! THANKS!
04:19	<delmorep>	Jordan_U: awesome, just like when a Quake3 server is full... i mean, an OpenArena server ;)
04:19	<Crav>	how do i upgrade from dapper to fiesty without needing to download the cd image?
04:19	<sky_shark>	does anyone know what i should do to get ubuntu fiesty to write to my windows partion?
04:19	<umop>	jimmygoon, What's so good about it?
04:19	<msand>	I only ever share with windows.. but you don't need to include a windows box on the network for it to work
04:20	<locke1689>	Crav: apt-get dist-upgrade
=== techfiz__ is now known as techfiz
04:20	<Kix>	<sky_shark: what file system?
04:20	<Jordan_U_>	!upgrade | Crav

04:20	<Crav>	Jordan_U_: thanks
04:20	<boss>	Is performance the only downside to using software RAID?
04:21	<boss>	As opposed to hardware RAID...
04:21	<blazemonger>	how do i prevent ubuntu from crashing when i run the molecule screensaver
04:21	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
04:21	<boss>	And I suppose not being able to use anything besides RAID 0[+1]  or RAID1[+0] 
04:21	<Jordan_U_>	boss, No, poor support under Linux also
04:21	<umop>	jimmygoon, sounds good! glad it works for you
04:21	<Impaque>	boss: well, with multi-threading CPUs of modern times, the overhead is just a few percent..
04:21	<cotton>	Doesn't ubuntu already come with LAMP installed?
04:21	<msand>	dauoalagio2: samba's pretty easy to configure through the command line
04:21	<locke1689>	msand: depends :)
04:21	<Impaque>	boss: with software raid, you can use any combo i believe
04:22	<wastrel>	why not just tar and scp
04:22	<boricua>	!LAMP
04:22	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
04:22	<boss>	I guess cost as well then.
04:22	<dager>	blazemonger: if its a 3d screensaver, make sure you have the correct video drivers
04:22	<boss>	So basically nowadays, what reasons are there to use hardware RAID?
04:22	<msand>	Well, for basic sharing it is.  I use it on a lan, so I don't worry too much about security.  Just basic username/password check.  No complaints
04:22	<jimmygoon>	Speaking of dealing with feisty, my friend is an idiot and installed a nasty deb that now won't remove because its in a very bad inconsistent state... thats a quote... any ideas?
04:23	<Kazol>	I am trying to choose a theme for Ubuntu. What types are compatible with Ubuntu? Is it GDM, Icon, or XMMS?
04:23	<dauoalagio2>	msand: how to anywhere?
04:23	<locke1689>	boss: well, youre not reliant on a specific operating system or piece of software
04:23	<Doughy>	I am having a problem re-logging into gnome.  If I try to log into an already-logged-in acocunt, my graphics go out.  My screen flickers white/brown... ideas?
04:23	<umop>	jimmygoon, tell him to apt-get remove packagname
04:23	<eric>	boss: Saving CPU time and PCI bus bandwidth.
04:23	<Impaque>	boss: well, for some really intensive CPU loads and simultaneous writes, hardware raid is the way to go. but for a general file server, no need to go hardware IMHO. i had some bad experiences with Promise controllers, i go software from then on
04:23	<blazemonger>	dager: i have a high quality rage 128 card though
04:23	<blazemonger>	and it runs every other 3d screensaver
04:23	<xtknight>	boss, swraid is faster in lots of cases
04:23	<boss>	Gotcha.
04:23	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, What .deb? if it truly won't remove then you probably need to edit whatever script is failing
04:23	<ardchoille>	Kazol: Depends on what you are trying to theme. You theming xmms? GDM? Window manager? other?
04:24	<boss>	xtknight: Seriously?
04:24	<msand>	dauoalagio2: plenty.  I'm looking for the one I used when I first set it up.
04:24	<xtknight>	boss, in many cases yea
04:24	<dager>	blazemonger: ah, well sometimes the problem can be you don't have the drivers installed correctly.. perhaps its a coding problem specific to that screensaver
04:24	<dauoalagio2>	msand: thanks
04:24	<xtknight>	boss, hardware raid is cross platform in some cases (if Win2k has a driver and linux has a driver for your card).  not sure that you can mount linux mdadm under win2k, for example
04:24	<xtknight>	boss, but software RAID is much easier to manage.  no hardware needed so you can move it amongst PCs
04:25	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, its some bcm43xx-firmware hacked together package he found (he should have waited for me to use ndiswrapper)
04:25	<cabajgtr_>	Is there an easy way to rebuild /dev ?
04:25	<amicrawler>	hey guys need some help
04:25	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an erro trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
04:25	<Kazol>	ardchoille: I am trying to theme the whole gui of everything, including the title bars. Something like this: http://overclockix.octeams.com/snapshot10.jpg
04:25	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question
04:25	<amicrawler>	my video in play mode is not full screen any more
04:25	<yell0w>	!defunct
04:25	<xtknight>	boss,  not to mention the raid on which your HD is based is a wide open standard, not some proprietary hole in the wall hardware chipset
04:25	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about defunct - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:25	<Impaque>	xtknight: but on other hand, consider this: if you go hardware, and your RAID card dies, you must get exactly the SAME model.. unfortunately, they tend to die after few years = they are hard to find..
04:25	<amicrawler>	i use xine as a player
04:25	<xtknight>	Impaque, yeah that's exactly why im using SWRAID right now...forget HW raid
04:25	<Impaque>	xtknight: with software, you can migrate to different IDE/SATA cards
=== cabajgtr_ is now known as cabajgtr
04:25	<Impaque>	xtknight: yeah, it rocks.
04:25	<boricua>	yellow: use kill -9 pid to remove defunct process
04:25	<amicrawler>	when i play video it is at the bottom of the screen
04:26	<SeveredCross>	Well
04:26	<SeveredCross>	Try not to use -9 unless a standard kill pid doesn't terminate it.
04:26	<SeveredCross>	-9 is a little overkill for MOST processes.
04:26	<amicrawler>	or is  over lapped video
04:26	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, I disagree about using NDIS wrapper :) But in what way won't it remove ( and BTW there is an official broadcom firmware package in the Ubuntu repos )
04:26	<umop>	amicrawler, You can't drag it up?
04:26	<SeveredCross>	The stubborn ones that don't end otherwise, fire the -9 away.
04:26	<amicrawler>	nope
04:26	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That's going to take several themes. I see: xmms theme, window manager theme, gtk2 theme, icon theme, etc. Besides, that picture looks like he's using kde.
04:26	<boricua>	or from command like killall apps
04:26	<amicrawler>	when in full screen
04:26	<umop>	amicrawler, ask the question in on line other wise noone will be able to keep track of it
04:26	<xtknight>	swraid is soo awesome
04:26	<Kix>	amicrawler: what output driver are you using?
04:26	<stalkerguypc>	oh where is beryl effect channel
04:26	<amicrawler>	opengl
04:26	<xtknight>	!beryl
04:26	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects

04:26	<stalkerguypc>	I want to get that puff of smoke working
04:27	<cotton>	How can I install mysql?
04:27	<Kazol>	ardchoille: What theme would include the title bars of programs, for example?
04:27	<amicrawler>	just updates to  fawn
04:27	<Tom47>	#ubuntu-effects
04:27	<stalkerguypc>	ah ok
04:27	<dager>	vavad, just ask :)
04:27	<stalkerguypc>	thanks
04:27	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, it literally says that message "package is in a very bad state" try to reinstall it or something like that
04:27	<boricua>	cotton: use synaptic
04:27	<ardchoille>	Kazol: That would be the window manager, the default wm in gnome is metacity.
04:27	<behdad>	Hi all , i can not login to , when i typein my username and password after a while it returns to the same login page .
04:27	<ardchoille>	Kazol: You using gnome?
04:27	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, I dunna about the package vs ndiswrapper but I know what he did was WRONG... esp when I had ndiswrapper working a week ago :S
04:27	<cabajgtr>	no one knows how to rebuild /dev ?
04:27	<DeadCowBoy>	Did Canonical think about new and faster servers since the release of feisty?
04:27	<vadvad>	hi dager! i wanna make my windows work along with linux, how?
04:27	<amicrawler>	kix  what do you think
04:27	<behdad>	any body knows what is the problem ?
04:27	<cotton>	boricua: What do I download in synaptic, I don't thik there is just a mysql package
04:28	<Kazol>	ardchoille: I am new to Linux. I am just using the default in 6.06 dapper drake.
04:28	<Kix>	amicrawler: what frontend are you using?
04:28	<locke1689>	so, just making sure, no one has an HDBits or Oink account? I could trade Demonoid.
04:28	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, Sorry i havn't been talking to Mark.
04:28	<Jack3>	how do i install source code that has INSTALL file and MAKEFILE
04:28	<dager>	vadvad: what exactly do you mean? on the same computer?
04:28	<amicrawler>	like gdm or kdm ?
04:28	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Can you pastebin the output of: sudo dpkg -r whatever.deb
04:28	<boricua>	cotton: when you select mysql also select client do a search for mysql in synaptic and install what you need
04:28	<Kazol>	ardchoille: thx, I will try to install theme
04:28	<vadvad>	yap
04:28	<towsonu2003>	behdad, have a look at whether you have space in your hard drive
04:28	<amicrawler>	or  video
04:28	<Impaque>	software RAID is easy to set up and with today's CPUs, the overhead is so negligible..
04:28	<amicrawler>	xine
04:28	<boricua>	!mysql cotton
04:28	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about mysql cotton - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:28	<DeadCowBoy>	umop wouldn't be a bad idea :P
04:28	<boricua>	!mysql @ cotton
04:28	<cabajgtr>	cotton, it should be there, or you could use 'sudo apt-get install mysql'
04:28	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about mysql @ cotton - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:28	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, haha.
04:28	<msand>	dauoalagio2: I can't find the one I used, but I might be able to walk you through it if you don't need to do anything unusual
04:28	<ardchoille>	Kazol: Then you are using the metacity window manager in gnome. Find a good metacity theme: http://art.gnome.org  or  http://www.gnome-look.org

04:29	<dager>	vadvad: you'll want to dual boot.. check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
04:29	<Impaque>	huXfluX: did you turn the "hardware" up? (volume knob, buttons) ?

04:29	<vadvad>	10x!
04:30	<Shaba1>	behdad disk space or ram?
04:30	<zeroday>	huXfluX: go to ubuntuforums and search toshiba sound fix
04:30	<DeadCowBoy>	umop i've been struggling to get my apt-get to download programs since the release... tonight it's working but is incredibly slow
04:30	<blazemonger>	intel needs to release drivers for distros other than redhat or suse
04:30	<blazemonger>	i dont have anything against suse or anything
04:30	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U_, I tried that method and it didn't work out so hawt with his card (its a stupid one)
04:30	<Kix>	amicrawler: have you played with the video settings? you should be able to choose which driver you want to use for output?
04:30	<blazemonger>	i just prefer a *nix based environment
04:30	<xtknight>	no program can tell any difference between a block device of /dev/sdaX and /dev/mdX, is that correct?  /dev/mdX acts EXACTLY as a hd device?  wiping it with zeros will write 0s to the logical partition, it wont destroy the raid array?
04:30	<burner>	stelios: use gparted on teh livecd
04:30	<huXfluX>	Impaque: where?
04:30	<Kix>	amicrawler: in xine player
04:30	<behdad>	got it shaba thanks
04:30	<huXfluX>	blazemonger: what did you do?
04:30	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: That's right.
04:30	<Ax4>	stelios, the recovery partition should still be accessible before you boot an OS
04:30	<huXfluX>	zeroday: thanx
04:30	<Jordan_U_>	jimmygoon, Did you try it with Feisty?
04:30	<cotton>	cabajgtr: Do I need to shutdown Apache before installing it?
04:30	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, an option is to download the alternate cd and upgrade from it, I think the mirrors will be slow for a while yet.

04:31	<stelios>	Ax4: this is my first time i try any distro of linux can you please explain how or where i can find it?
04:31	<Ax4>	stelios, it's the entire point of having it there in cases stuff gets messed up, i personally would leave that space alone and not over write it, instead partition the other remaining partition into two pieces
04:31	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, yeah
04:31	<Impaque>	huXfluX: on your laptop.. on my toshiba, i have a volume knob
04:31	<huXfluX>	ah
04:31	<huXfluX>	yes, of course
04:31	<huXfluX>	it's at max
04:31	<jube>	I want to create some short videos (just youtube length / style). Can anyone recommend a simple movie studio program I can install on ubuntu?
04:31	<Fujitsu>	jube: Try Kino.
04:31	<Ax4>	stelios, as burner said, use gparted
04:31	<umop>	DeadCowBoy, I don't think it is.. Maybe a slight chance of a package breaking, but they shouldn't and you can always recover them.
04:31	<stelios>	Ax4: i know but it's not working anymore :)
04:31	<blazemonger>	huXfluX: in windows the drivers are these soundmax 4 program

04:31	<Ax4>	again, im having a problem with getting my SSL Certificate to work with Ezbounce under Feisty7.0.4, any ideas?
04:31	<behdad>	jube : you can find pretty fine video editor in 7.04
04:32	<jube>	fuijitusu, thanks, I'll check out kino
04:32	<DeadCowBoy>	umop i've formatted my main partition already
04:32	<xtknight>	Fujitsu, know of a good buffered and unbuffered HD write benchmark for linux?  (out of repos)
04:32	<Ax4>	stelios, what's not working?
04:32	<towsonu2003>	behdad, use this: df -h
04:32	<burner>	stelios: what's not working?
04:32	<jube>	behdad, I have feisty running, what is the video editor called?
04:32	<LM1>	How do I force a hardware redetect?
04:32	<dauoalagio2>	msand: scp?
04:32	<Cactusbin>	i must agree 7.04 is better than eft by a long shot

04:33	<DeadCowAFK>	umop already did the clean install... i just need to be patient with the apt-get install
04:33	<towsonu2003>	behdad, oh okay -just free some space and it will let you log in...
04:33	<umop>	cotton, google
04:33	<Fujitsu>	xtknight: Ah, you're right.
04:33	<Impaque>	Fujitsu: hdparm is not a good tester.
04:33	<behdad>	jube: i dont know wxactly but if you go to the Add/Remove application section in multimedia category you can find bunch of usefull video editors
04:33	<xtknight>	-Tt does work and i get good perf from it
04:33	<Jack3>	does ubuntu come with ieee80211 installed?
04:33	<huXfluX>	now another thing. how can i remove an item from the "Applications" menu ?
04:33	<xtknight>	i'm going to try bonnie++
04:33	<dauoalagio2>	msand: sounds fine, does cp work with folders>
04:33	<Impaque>	xtknight: try bonnie+ or iozone
04:33	<behdad>	towsonu2003: thanku so much
04:33	<LM1>	How do I force a hardware redetect?

04:33	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

04:33	<umop>	DeadCowAFK, okay, cya
04:33	<revmischa>	does this problem sound familiar to anyone?
04:34	<cotton>	thanks
04:34	<vadvad>	which file system do i have to chose for my ubuntu partition?
04:34	<locke1689>	are there any benefits to upgrading to Ubuntu Feisty?
04:34	<umop>	cotton, don't be so lazy
04:34	<cire_>	anyone know how i can get screen resolution to set at 1360x768?
04:34	<jube>	behdad, ok, I did go through the multimedia section but I only found sound file editors... maybe i'm blind
04:34	<jube>	I'll look again and also check out kino
04:34	<xtknight>	vadvad, usually ext3
04:34	<Crav>	vadvad: ext3
04:34	<pandimus>	Hello all
04:34	<xtknight>	i like xfs for handling huge files
04:34	<cire_>	i added that resolution the xorg.conf file but no luck
04:34	<xtknight>	ext3 is probably the most reliable
04:34	<nibsa1242b>	bye all, now that I've fixed (by doing a fresh install) my failed desktop upgrade from edgy -. fiesty I'm going to try to upgrade this machine wish me luck
04:34	<Impaque>	xtknight: ditto.
04:34	<locke1689>	vadvad: xfs
04:34	<vadvad>	what is swap?
04:34	<xtknight>	xfs has a defratg util
04:34	<xtknight>	vadvad, it is the page file or partition
04:34	<Jordan_U>	jimmygoon, probably a good idea, I can't think of what that package could have been trying to do, it should be very simple, but if whoever made it didn't know that such a thing already existed they probably can't be trusted to greatly :)
04:34	<Impaque>	vadvad: xfs is the best bang for the buck.
04:34	<Impaque>	but..
04:34	<Ax4>	stelios, if you over wrote the recovery partition, it's gone and you'll have to contact your computer manufacturer / distributor for recovery CDs, you can still install ubuntu on any remaining partitions if you are currently without an operating system though
04:34	<Impaque>	!best
04:34	<ubotu>	Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
04:34	<msand>	dauoalagio2: sure does.  If you specify a folder instead of a file, it'll copy the whole folder
04:35	<xtknight>	ext3 is more reliable than xfs i think
04:35	<xtknight>	in shutdown conditions
04:35	<xtknight>	atomic?
04:35	<nibsa1242b>	exit

04:35	<xtknight>	heh they both use journaling though
04:35	<behdad>	jube:mmm , if im not mistaken in the top-right side of add/remove section is kind of filtering that you can declare what sort of packages you want to see , in that case chang it to all types , like supported and unsupported

04:35	<yoi>	!grub
04:35	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U, exactly my thoughts, I don't feel like reversing a deb to find out whats wrong tonight, all he's done to it is delete the stupid gnome-panels( he didn't know how to fix it ) so its probably for the better
04:35	<revmischa>	how do i make my gnome menubars come back?
04:35	<Jordan_U>	cotton, You can only have one package manager running at once
04:35	<locke1689>	xtknight: its a lot faster though, and a lot more efficient in storage
04:35	<jimmygoon>	Jordan_U, thanks for all your help
04:35	<revmischa>	running gnome is pretty annoying when you can't open any windows
04:35	<msand>	dauoalagio2: you'd need  to know the full path.. can't tab for the remote folders, I think.

04:36	<locke1689>	wait so guys is there any benefit to upgrading to feisty from dapper?
04:36	<revmischa>	like setting up gnome stuff, Add/Remove Programs
04:36	<dager>	vadvad: its good, trust me
04:36	<Shaba1>	gus
04:36	<Shaba1>	sorry
04:36	<ardchoille>	revmischa: Type in: gnome-terminal   <- that will launch a term
04:36	<Shaba1>	guys
04:36	<Caplain>	how do i configure X?
04:36	<revmischa>	yes, i can launch gnome stuff manually
04:36	<vadvad>	i trust u :)
04:37	<revmischa>	i used to be able to point to the upper portion of my screen
04:37	<revmischa>	and a drop down menu would appear
04:37	<Impaque>	xtknight: reiser4 looks good on paper. the ideas behind it are cool.. but the implementation.. and how stable it is; better said, is not.. nah
04:37	<stelios>	Ax4: i understand what you trying to explain me but i lost the recovery partition files during vista installation
04:37	<wuzzerd>	locke1689: not much mostly a few hassles
04:37	<revmischa>	you know, like normal gnome stuff
04:37	<xtknight>	Impaque, yeah that's my impression..
04:37	<Jordan_U>	Caplain, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
04:37	<revmischa>	i upgrade to feisty and its gone
04:37	<umop>	locke1689, yes, but you can decide for yourself
04:37	<Shaba1>	Is there a good vnc viewer and server combination for ubuntu?
04:37	<revmischa>	everything else was fine!
04:37	<Ax4>	cotton: mysql-server
04:37	<behdad>	caplain: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg
04:37	<Caplain>	Jordan_U, thanks
04:37	<Impaque>	Shaba1: tightvnc
04:37	<xtknight>	Impaque, supposedly reiser fsck just makes things worse most of the time
04:37	<ardchoille>	revmischa: ALT+F2, type in  gnome-panel  ?
04:37	<xjkx>	Do ubuntu come with any developing tooL ?
04:37	<fizzmahon>	guys are the repertoires down? i cant install anything! says currently available
04:37	<cire_>	anyone know how i can get screen resolution to set at 1360x768?

04:37	<ubotu>	The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
04:37	<locke1689>	Will it damage anything on the normal partition?
04:38	<rrittenhouse>	I am booted into the feisty "live" portion of the install. I go through the install until I get to partitioning step and It just gives me the "Manual" option and when i go to the next screen it displays nothing.. any ideas?
04:38	<threford>	hello people, I am having this same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=411642 -- do you think the problem might be the suggested one
04:38	<xjkx>	!developing by default
04:38	<Moosejaw>	i am having major speed issues with my wireless connection...it is only connecting at 11mb/sec and my speeds are 200kbdown and 100kb up since i installed feisty.  anyone have any suggestions?
04:38	<revmischa>	xjkx: there's all kind of dev stuff you can install
04:38	<behdad>	caplain: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
04:38	<Stormx2>	Woh
04:38	<xjkx>	revmischa, thats not my question
04:38	<Ax4>	stelios, so what's ur system look like? [---------- VISTA ---------]  [-------- free space ------]  [-------deleted recovery console -------]  ?
04:38	<n122vu>	I can't get Ubuntu to do an update from the CD...
04:38	<Caplain>	okay....
04:38	<Stormx2>	democracyplayer == great!
04:38	<revmischa>	ok so i appear to have a blank gnome panel
04:38	<Caplain>	thanks
04:38	<xtknight>	my repertoire says the repositories are not down
04:38	<xtknight>	:P
04:38	<revmischa>	xjkx: it does not 'come' with it installed
04:38	<xjkx>	revmischa, NONE ? :/
04:38	<Impaque>	xtknight: i burned myself with reiser3 as well.. after one crash, fsck ofcourse, the next thing i see is that some files i opened JUST FOR READING got mixed up together with some other files.. like, /etc/fstab had contents of /etc/exports and such.. massive corruption just from one "dirty" restart
04:38	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: which are you using
04:38	<LM1>	how do you get ubuntu to redetect hardware?
04:38	<xtknight>	fizzmahon, which repository?
04:38	<Ax4>	sometimes i hate how i give out so much help and dont' get any for my more specific difficult questions lol
04:38	<tehquickness>	How well is the ati drivers 8.36 installing on feisty?
04:38	<revmischa>	xjkx: it's pretty easy to type aptitude install build-essential
04:39	<xtknight>	LM1, redetect what hw?
04:39	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: canadian one
04:39	<Impaque>	xtknight: and i can't stress it enough: the crash wasn't when i wrote to the files or anything..
04:39	<xtknight>	fizzmahon, default, american one here
04:39	<Jordan_U>	LM1, What hardware?
04:39	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: thanks
04:39	<xjkx>	revmischa, i am making a description its not for my usage, please understand ;] 
04:39	<Ax4>	(difficult being a point-of-view i suppose)
04:39	<LM1>	a NIC it was working then it just quit
04:39	<rrittenhouse>	Is anybody else having problems with the feisty installer where your drives arent showing up?
04:39	<LM1>	still works great in xp
04:39	<revmischa>	ok so i appear to have a totally blank gnome panel.  how do i get back all the default stuff that is usually in my gnome panels?  i already tried making a new user, and i tried blowing away all of my .gnome directories
04:39	<xtknight>	Impaque, ahh ugh.  well i saw a horrible gruesome description of what reiser fsck does somewhere.. rant by theodore ts'o (kernel dev)
04:39	<revmischa>	all gone
04:39	<wind>	{new to linux. need a file sharing program. suggestions?}
04:39	<peeps>	hmm, whodathunk my USB DVD/CD burner drive was a "legacy device"
04:39	<revmischa>	xjkx: no dev tools included in standard install.
04:39	<Impaque>	xtknight: (ext2/3 guy?) ;)
04:39	<xtknight>	Impaque, maybe they made fsck better in r4.  i have used the reisers before and no trouble yet at all
04:40	<xtknight>	Impaque, lol ya
04:40	<Jordan_U>	LM1, does it show up in lspci?
04:40	<xtknight>	Impaque, i guess
04:40	<revmischa>	xjkx: takes a tiny bit of effort to install some
04:40	<xjkx>	revmischa, thanks
04:40	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: what kind of speeds are you getting? my canadian just accepted my xoconnection but at 10kb/s
04:40	<Moosejaw>	can anyone help me with these messed up wireless speeds?  it was fine in edgy using the broadcom driver, but now it aint working properly...
04:40	<msand>	wind: p2p file sharing, or something to share files and folders in a home network?
04:40	<n122vu>	I can't even get to the installer.  the upgrade dialog does not appear, and using gksu as suggested on the ubuntu site does not work
04:40	<tehquickness>	Has anyone istalled the new ATI driver (8.36)?
04:40	<LM1>	in hardware it shows it as unknown
04:40	<xtknight>	fizzmahon, hold on i'm running a benchmark but ill let you know
04:40	<cotton>	Thanks poeple who helped me

04:40	<rrittenhouse>	Is anybody else having problems with the feisty installer where your drives arent showing up?
04:40	<stelios>	Ax4: in vista  and xp i used to see 2 partitions(in my computer) the hard disk which was an xp installation (Now vista) and the recovery partition(the files there cannot be used anymore, now i have the cds for recovery)...but now in ubuntu when i tried to install i saw another small partition...but i prefer not to use it because i don't know what's in it, so i would like to use the recovery partition which has plenty of gb and the files don't w
04:40	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: grrr! haha
04:40	<xtknight>	fizzmahon, just use US  mirrors then?
04:41	<fizzmahon>	/server irc.slashnet.net
04:41	<Moosejaw>	Jordan_u, you helped me install the fwcutter for the broadcom driver, but having major speed issues now using wireless...
04:41	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an error trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
04:41	<fizzmahon>	oops sorry guys
04:41	<Moosejaw>	any ideas on where i should start?
04:41	<Impaque>	xtknight: i'm sticking with xfs.. but the thing i dislike, it has it's own quota tool; it isn't using the standard tools..
04:41	<xtknight>	Impaque, ive used reiserfs probably on 3 partitions before for periods of time  with no issues at all.  does jesus love me?
04:41	<msand>	wind: I like ktorrent, but I haven't tried much else.  It's fast, though, so I'm happy
04:41	<fizzmahon>	xtknight: yeah i am changing it now

04:42	<xtknight>	Impaque, or my..future losses..we'll say
04:42	<Impaque>	xtknight: heheh ;)
04:42	<xtknight>	Impaque, tried ext4?
04:42	<TokenBad>	rrittenhouse, I had problems with it...but it was saying the drives was messed up..so I went to dapper...installed it...then went and installed feisty

04:42	<Jack3>	guys, am i gonna screw over my UBuntu build if I remove the built in ieee80211 files and replace them with my own build???????????
04:43	<Ax4>	stelios, you can go into control panel ->	administrative tools ->	computer management ->	disk management ->	and select the partition, then "SHRINK" it down, then reboot using the ubuntu live cd and partition the ubuntu install into that empty space you make :)
04:43	<Impaque>	xtknight: nope, i left that to my bleedingedgier gentoo friends.. who burned themselves with it
04:43	<msand>	locke1689: why do you say that?  I haven't had any problems with it, but I haven't used it all that long.  I've used azureus and it was never as fast as ktorrent is.
04:43	<wind>	no i dont. new to linux. a baby in command line
04:43	<LM1>	yes it does show it in lspic
04:43	<xtknight>	Impaque,  im hoping they're adding speed improvements but it looks mostly like expanding volume and file size limits, etc... the 'boring' server-related  stuff
04:43	<Fnyar>	zeroday, hmm, I don't have any wireless adapters...
04:43	<tehquickness>	Has anyone installed the newest at drivers??
04:43	<drumline_>	geezuz...  Ubuntu really screwed my MBR...  that's just retarded.
04:43	<dager>	msand: try rtorrent.. it'll knock your socks off ;)
04:43	<Ax4>	stelios, or you can boot with the ubuntu livecd, and use gparted to shrink down your VISTA partition or any other partition

04:44	<Ax4>	tmgomez, we all have questions, just ask
04:44	<Fujitsu>	TokenBad: It means that you should look for a bug report, and file one if it isn't already there. Something is broken.
04:44	<Impaque>	xtknight: well, server stuff is very important to me ;) but i won't put it on my servers until some years pass and it proves itself stable

04:44	<towsonu2003>	tmbg, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
04:44	<stelios>	Ax4: may i ask why is needed to shrink the partition?(sorry i'm new to this :)
04:44	<tmgomez>	TY
04:44	<TokenBad>	mean where do I look
04:44	<towsonu2003>	tmgomez, sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
04:44	<TokenBad>	stelios, you can use gparted
04:45	<chrisjs169|afk>	tmbg: or sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
04:45	<Fujitsu>	TokenBad: It's bug #91392
04:45	<tmgomez>	towsonu2003 thanx
04:45	<tmbg>	towsonu2003, eh?
04:45	<pandimus>	When i was using the live cd of ubuntu, my wireless worked fine, now i cannot see the wireless adapter in the network connection menu, and when i tried to install a windows driver via ndiswapper it said the driver is already installed
04:45	<LM1>	is there a command to redetect hardware?
04:45	<xtknight>	Impaque, honesly ext3 has been treating me well.  and raid0 is looking to be fast
04:45	<Fujitsu>	http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/k3d/+bug/91392
04:45	<locke1689>	msand: in my experience it operates without about the same resources, not as many options, and slower than azureus
04:45	<Ax4>	stelios, if you don't break up the operating system areas you are going to lose windows, you can't have two operating systems occupying the same region of space on the hard disk
04:45	<towsonu2003>	tmbg, sorry, tab gave wrong nickname -nevermind
04:45	<chrisjs169|afk>	tmgomez rather
04:45	<locke1689>	*with
04:45	<stelios>	TokenBad: i'm now in live cd can you explain where i can find gparted?
04:45	<kbidd>	Im trying to set up port forwarding on azureus, and have checked and double-checked the router setup, and now think connections might be getting blocked by something in ubuntu -- is this possible?
04:45	<zeroday>	ppandiumus: Unplug and then replug your wireless adapter
04:45	<TokenBad>	open terminal
04:45	<Tom47>	TokenBad: have you checked the cd for errors?
04:45	<Impaque>	xtknight: well, ext3 IS stable as hell, but the speed tradeoff is huge
04:45	<pandimus>	ive done that several times
04:45	<TokenBad>	type sudo gparted
04:46	<Ax4>	again, im having a problem with getting my SSL Certificate to work with Ezbounce under Feisty7.0.4, any ideas?
04:46	<Crazytom>	pandimus, just do lsmod ndiswrapper
04:46	<orangey>	hey all!
04:46	<pandimus>	its pcmcia
04:46	<Impaque>	xtknight: and, to mention that xfs has raid-tuning feats
04:46	<revmischa>	kbidd: have you tried telnetting to the ip address/port from a completely different host
04:46	<TokenBad>	Tom47, I am in the installed OS
04:46	<chrisjs169|afk>	is the ubuntu torrent server down?  KTorrent is complaining about it being down...
04:46	<zeroday>	pandimus: Have you tried manually inputting an SSID
04:46	<wastrel>	what's ezbounce?
04:46	<xtknight>	Impaque, really?  i thought it was basically the fastest too, with one exception (big files/fragmentation)
04:46	<Impaque>	xtknight: like, defining the stripe size and the number of stripes per.. block or sth
04:46	<Ax4>	wastrel, bnc software
04:46	<revmischa>	maybe i should give up and do a clean install from CD
04:46	<xtknight>	Impaque, well my /home is XFS and raid0 .  / is ext3 and raid0.   /boot is ext3
04:46	<Tom47>	TokenBad: yes i understand but did you at any stage check the burn for errors?
04:46	<wastrel>	ok!   what's bnc?
04:46	<zazeem>	help please
04:46	<TokenBad>	tom47 yes
04:46	<dinochopins>	hi mates
04:47	<Tom47>	ok
04:47	<dfgas>	how do i remove java 1.4 completely? i don't want 1.4 on just 1.6 cause 1.4 is making my browser crash
04:47	<Fujitsu>	!helpme | zazeem
04:47	<msand>	locke1689: Interesting about it being slower.  Though I admit, it's entirely possible I've never tried azureus on linux, just the Win version.. and Windows has never had download speeds that I get on linux in any application.
04:47	<ubotu>	zazeem: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
04:47	<rrittenhouse>	The feisty installer acts like it does not detect my hard drive. When im in the partitioning section it only gives me manual as a choice to partition and if i choose that it doesnt list any partitions in the box?? Anybody know what to do?
04:47	<zeroday>	zazeem whats ur question
04:47	<dinochopins>	need to ask about installation through network
04:47	<compilerwriter>	!ask | zazeem
04:47	<concept10>	nalioth, why did you do that? please open the channel back up
04:47	<tmgomez>	towsonu2003 it said couldnt find anything matching ubuntu-desktop :/
04:47	<Impaque>	xtknight: well, for fragmentation, you can always use con kolivas' defrag or what's the name..
04:47	<Ax4>	wastrel, bnc = 'bouncer' - a configurable irc proxy with ipv6 and ssl support
04:47	<zazeem>	how do i change my ubuntu main menu image to a custom image?
04:47	<rrittenhouse>	I keep asking it seems nobodys catching it? :P
04:47	<zazeem>	tried tutorials but diudnt work
04:47	<xtknight>	Impaque, hmm for ext?
04:47	<dinochopins>	is there any good resourcen on how to install Ubuntu via network ?
04:47	<pandimus>	when i did lsmod ndiswapper all it said was usage:lsmod
04:47	<wastrel>	Ax4:  thanks
04:47	<nalioth>	concept10: #ubuntu-offtopic please
04:47	<huXfluX>	hey! is there a way to set the thumbnails size? it would be great if the pictures icon would be the same size as text icons
04:47	<xtknight>	Impaque, xfs_fsr for xfs.. i did hear of an ext2 defrag
04:47	<Impaque>	xtknight: not FS specific
04:47	<towsonu2003>	tmgomez, do: sudo aptitude update and then do sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
04:47	<stelios>	TokenBad: may i ask what is "lba" means( it's under flags tab) the partition which i have vista has boot there and the partition that i want to have ubuntu says lba
04:48	<xtknight>	Impaque, ohh cp back and forth
04:48	<concept10>	nalioth, for what?
04:48	<ajmorris_>	concept10, #ubuntu+1 just forwards me here now
04:48	<zeroday>	pandimu: whats ur wireless adapter
04:48	<Impaque>	xtknight: yeah, moving inodes here and there or something ;)
04:48	<xtknight>	Impaque, i am using con koliavs kernel patches though (unrelated interactivity tweaks)
04:48	<nny>	i am stuuuuck
04:48	<tmgomez>	towsonu2003 its not hooked to the net does that matter?
04:48	<concept10>	this is insane

04:48	<Impaque>	xtknight: yeah, i like his patchset ;)
04:48	<towsonu2003>	tmgomez, oh yes, that's a problem... it has to download stuff from the internet, unless you have a desktop install cd I think
04:48	<pandimus>	it worked perfect when i was in livecd mode.
04:48	<nny>	please for the love of good can someone explain the changed to fiesty
04:49	<quaal>	ok so if i setup a shared printer with the URI http://192.168.0.7:631/printers/officejet_5500_series and i print a test page, it says Printing 1 jobs and then the job goes away and printer status goes back to ready, everything is working fine on the ubuntu end? I'm not getting anything printed
04:49	<finch>	Is there some reason that acpi and other power management stuff needs to be installed on a desktop install?
04:49	<xjkx>	no *buntus comming with any IRC (such as xchat) application by default, right?

04:51	<ubotu>	n122vu: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
04:51	<n122vu>	(evidently not)

04:53	<cotton>	What is my browser asking me to download .php files?
04:53	<n122vu>	Now it does not show up.
04:53	<xtknight>	resolutions have to be divisible by 8 in a lot of cases

04:55	<peeps>	msand, no
04:55	<xtknight>	stelios, it just means greater than a puny size hard disk.  it's for all modern stuff.  it's all LBA.  if you dont have LBA you have like 4 gig HDs at max or something puny

04:57	<cotton>	Impaque: Doesn't ubuntu come with LAMP?
04:57	<zazeem>	how do i change my ubuntu main menu image to a custom image?
04:57	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: Don't you know?
04:57	<stelios>	xtknight: i have already vista install in another partition? so what i have to do? i mean mount point"/" or somethinf else?
04:57	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: not familiar with that
04:57	<bradyc>	I can't wait to try beryl on this machine... but I need to get my resolution higher first... 800by600 sucks.
04:57	<jughead>	] Johnny[, it depends, a lot of people like xchat, others prefer irssi, and there are a ton of clients out there
04:57	<xtknight>	refefer, laptop=linux/vga only and computer=windows/dvi only  or am i confused?
04:57	<towsonu2003>	behdad: hmm, maybe it might be easier for you to use a Live CD, boot Linux, mount /home, install baobab, find files that are big and delete them using the graphical interface / gnome of Live CD
04:58	<rrittenhouse>	How can I get the feisty installer to ACTUALLY WORK?!
04:58	<Impaque>	cotton: it does, but there is really piece of cake method to install it by getting ubuntu-server edition
04:58	<Fnyar>	zeroday, thanks for the suggestion regarding network-manager, that's certainly what was putting the icon in my system tray. That seems strange that there wouldn't be an option to not display it.
04:58	<towsonu2003>	behdad, you're welcome :)
04:58	<rrittenhouse>	How can I get the feisty installer to ACTUALLY WORK?!
04:58	<Impaque>	cotton: it has "Install LAMP server" option ;)
04:58	<refefer>	xtknight: no can do since my dell with ubuntu only has vga out.  I'm trying to get ubuntu to use a widescreen resolution on it
04:58	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: http://www.beryl-project.org/
04:58	<Crav>	rrittenhouse: what's your problem?
04:58	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: you wouldnt happen to know how to change the menu icon would you?
04:58	<cotton>	Impaque: HOW HOW HOW
04:58	<xtknight>	stelios, you dont mount the vista to /
04:58	<pandimus>	is there a command to see if ubuntu can see my wireless card? pcmcia, it does not show up on network connections
04:58	<xtknight>	stelios, you can mount that to /media/vista
04:58	<Shaba1>	Is there some special internet radio player for linux
04:58	<Shaba1>	or can I jsut use winamp
04:58	<stelios>	:( i'm lost
04:58	<behdad>	cotton: no its not like that , simply go to php.net and read configuration for apache config file , modify them in your apache config file then restart your apache with : sudo apache2 -k restart
04:58	<Burgundavia>	Shaba1: rhythmbox can play it
04:58	<refefer>	xtknight: heh, this is one of those micro cases and for some bizarre reason they cheaped out on dvi
04:58	<xtknight>	refefer, ah ok what kind of driver are you using on the dell
04:58	<jughead>	refefer, are you trying to get widescreen on the vga out or just in general?
04:59	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: I'm having a first hand experience. Don0t know enough yet
04:59	<rrittenhouse>	Crav: When installing Ubuntu Feisty - im in the installer and it will not let me get past the partitioning. It acts as if i have no drives on here
04:59	<bradyc>	pandimus: iwconfig or ifconfig
04:59	<Impaque>	!server
04:59	<Burgundavia>	Shaba1: winamp is windows only, hence the win part of the name
04:59	<ubotu>	Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments, including a server-specific !kernel and no !GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current !LTS version is 6.06. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/ - The #ubuntu-server channel provides specific support
04:59	<dave___>	my header files are at [/lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/build/include]   correct?
04:59	<refefer>	jughead: just in general
04:59	<msand>	Shaba1: streamtuner does that I think
04:59	<rrittenhouse>	Crav: It gives me the manual option and i select it and it lists nothing in the box
04:59	<xtknight>	dave___, uhh yes
04:59	<jughead>	Shaba1, I use streamtuner and beep media player for internet radio
04:59	<bradyc>	as for hardware stuff with PCMCIA, it's something I have no experience with.
04:59	<xtknight>	dave___, if your kernel version is 2.6.20-15-generic
04:59	<behdad>	towsonu2003: no way man , as a computer science student it is time to lear before OS subject in next sem ;)
04:59	<finn>	is there an easy way to update linux-uvc driver in feisty? the one included in the kernel is too old and doesn't work with my webcam?
04:59	<dave___>	yeah, vm gives me the same error
04:59	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: ya, i forgot since last installation
04:59	<jughead>	refefer, I have a dell widescree laptop and I installed the 915resolution package
04:59	<Moosejaw>	hey guys i just upgraded to feisty fawn in ubuntu, got my wireless back up and working but now by download speeds are abysmally slow....and up speeds as well...whats going wrong?
04:59	<xtknight>	refefer, ok what is the native resoluton of the lcdtv?
04:59	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: havnt used it in a while

05:00	<zazeem>	how do i change my ubuntu main menu image to a custom image?
05:00	<vox754>	Burgundavia, hey, nice meeting you... I assume somebody is leaking info about the new Ubuntu, hence the topic
05:00	<Shaba1>	finn what is uvc
05:00	<pandimus>	ive tried to get it to recognize my wireless adapter, but it wont. It says my driver is already installed when i try to install it with ndiswapper
05:00	<southafrikanse>	zazeem: Well thank you for any help
05:00	<finn>	Shaba1, it's a driver for a number of v4l2 webcams
05:00	<dave___>	worked fine on edgy
05:00	<refefer>	xtknight: since it's an HD monitor, it can do up to 1080i.  Personally, I'd be completely fine with 720p which I believe is 1280x720
05:00	<xtknight>	dave___, youd have to pastebin the whole log
05:00	<finn>	mainly the logitech ones
05:00	<Burgundavia>	vox754: nah, merely that it doesn't exist in any form that is installable and if you try, you are going to break your computer
05:00	<bradyc>	does the interface show up when you run ifconfig?
05:00	<dave___>	gotcha
05:00	<refefer>	jughead: yes
05:01	<xtknight>	refefer, some LCD tvs however do not allow tv input at the native
05:01	<dave___>	whats that pastebin site
05:01	<kruncher>	I've got a question. Isnt the network manager in 7.04 supposed to show traffic flowing through it (i.e. graphic changing)?
05:01	<refefer>	jughead: it's a dell
05:01	<Crazytom>	pandimus, please join #ubuntuwireless and i will help you there
05:01	<pandimus>	no bradyc
05:01	<bradyc>	I'm guessing not.
05:01	<jason_>	so no one knows why java is doing that
05:01	<xtknight>	!pastebin | dave___
05:01	<ubotu>	dave___: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)

05:01	<zazeem>	southafrikanse: you 2
05:01	<refefer>	xtknight: I'm not quite sure I follow what you mean by that.  Are you saying that my tv might not support widescreen via vga?  I know I've been able to get it to work in XP, if that's any help
05:02	<Burgundavia>	] Johnny[: choose burn to disk. If non ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto

05:02	<xtknight>	refefer, does XP work with the biggest/native resolution of the LCD TV ?  just curious
05:02	<zazeem>	Burgundavia: yes
05:02	<quaal>	 enable "Detect LAN Printers" on the "Global Settings" menu. where is this global settings menu ?
05:03	<n122vu>	whois zazeem
05:03	<Burgundavia>	zazeem: that is an icon. Let me dig up a blog post about how to change it
05:03	<jughead>	 refefer look at http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty and search for 915resolution; I followed the guide and it works like a charm
05:03	<GionnyBoss>	refefer: I'm not sure I understand right your problem. You have a dell laptop and you can't use some resolution? because I had this problem too and now it's solved
05:03	<zazeem>	Burgundavia: ok thanks :)

05:04	<dave___>	ok found a patch to make it work
05:04	<Drk_Guy>	I have tried with the 6.6 version but the image was damaged, so i (torrent) downloaded Ubuntu 7.4

05:04	<Drk_Guy>	I am going to install Java now
05:05	<behdad>	cotton: let me copy paste my config file
05:05	<Drk_Guy>	For then installing Frostwire

05:05	<carlhempel>	no more Jpackage nonsense!

05:05	<bradyc>	msand: thanks

05:10	<xtknight>	SnoopyTwo, per-session gnome startup progs are in system->preferences->Sessions
05:10	<GionnyBoss>	SnoopyTwo: no problem
05:10	<coz_>	Pie-rate, well that seems up in the air, i did both an upgrade from edgy to feisty then a complet clen install of feisty, and although if yu upgrade you will have to reinstall the nvidia driver becuse it is a different kernel
05:10	<Drk_Guy>	But the instructions that page gives me are totally confusing
05:10	<zak_>	NBrepresent, trace bitmap? if you mean trace a bitmap [ie vectorise it] , inkscape will... but if you mean something else, it's probably not in my brain :)
05:10	<lotacus>	guys. does BloGTK support spaces.live.com?
05:10	<lotacus>	or anyone know an app that will?
05:10	<coz_>	Pie-rate, also I am not sure the kernel allows the official nvidia driver because even now eachtime I reboot I have to reinstall the nividia driver with feisty which I thought was fixed
05:10	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon Guys, i need help on this stuff

05:11	<Drk_Guy>	And type that stuff
05:11	<finch>	Is gnome-session-manager what starts up programs on login?
05:11	<linoleum>	hi. guys, do you know a programm similar to Dev c++ underwindos , for the gnome desktop ?
05:11	<GionnyBoss>	Drk_Guy: why? just open a terminal ... Applications ->	Accessories ->	Terminal
05:11	<Xk2c>	yes finch
05:12	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, no open a terminal and copy paste those command in
05:12	<Kix>	linoleum: Anjuta
05:12	<msand>	rrittenhouse: I'm guessing no one's had that problem.  I didn't, personally, so it's hard to give help.  Maybe if you gave details about your drives?
05:12	<boss>	linoleum: If you don't mind using KDE tools, KDevelop is nice.
05:12	<blazemonger>	if any of you have a amiga system with a bit of memory ill trade a dell latitude c640 laptop
05:12	<finch>	gnome-session-manager depends on the acpi crap for some reason so I can't uninstall those?

05:12	<kbidd>	Im having trouble with setting up port forwarding to this computer (sorry about the repeat question -- my computer's power cord got pulled after i asked last time) -- it is the DMZ, but applications still report a firewall -- is it possible something in ubuntu is blocking connections?
05:12	<SnoopyTwo>	One more thing....     What's the best method to manage ipchains/iptabes... etc... FW stuff ?
05:12	<nomad111>	hey everyone
05:12	<Alonea>	ok, if its 'gnome-session' in ubuntu, what is it in kubuntu?
05:12	<linoleum>	Kix:  is it a bit too complicated ... I'm just a student I dont need a powerfull IDE. Dev c++ is good because it's "simple"
05:13	<refefer_>	xtknight: hmm, supposedly my resolution is listed in each section... how do I go about selecting it?
05:13	<xtknight>	why can't i open rpm files with mc?  it says inconsistent extfs archive?
05:13	<linoleum>	boss: ok I take a look
05:13	<nomad111>	i installed 915resolution package for my dell inspiron 6400 to get 1280x800 resolution but its not working
05:13	<xtknight>	refefer_, you must restart your X server
05:13	<rrittenhouse>	msand: thanks. Ok I have an 160GB Western Digital IDE Drive. I have feisty on it now actually but its a messy upgraded version and I just wanted to install a clean install of Fesity. I do have a problem where grub takes like 2 minutes to get through maybe its related IDK?
05:13	<kbidd>	Alonea, if nobody knows here, try asking in #kubuntu
05:13	<FireJet>	Can someone please take a look at this for me: http://kubuntuforums.net/forums/index.php?topic=3082163.0
05:13	<sabgenton>	how do i run stuff in the background in bash?
05:13	<xtknight>	refefer_, press ctrl alt backspace to terminate everything instantly (youll lose all documents)
05:13	<Alonea>	kbidd: I did already
05:13	<xtknight>	refefer_, or you could properly logout or reboot but those aren't as fast/fun ;)
05:13	<sabgenton>	so i can close the bash sesion and  the comand keeps running
05:13	<drumline_>	I can't believe Ubuntu did this to my computer.   It can't see the partition on boot and NTDLR is missing on the XP side of things.
05:13	<rrittenhouse>	msand: Motherboard is D875PBZ just using onboard IDE nothing special
05:13	<Alonea>	I am trying to read this how to page and its all gnome and I wanted to do it on KDE (its beryl)
05:13	<Kix>	linoleum: I dont believe it's any more difficult? I've used Dev c++ alot? Kdevlop is a bit much... else you could just use good ol' gedit and the CLI :p
05:14	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: consider using Eclipse with C plugin... it's easier ;)
05:14	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, i opened the console, i have typed that stuff in, and it is downloading some stufff
05:14	<Pie-rate>	coz_: i want to just use the restricted device manager in feisty for nvidia drivers, at least until there's a new driver which i *need* in order to get a bug fix (namely when they fix the black windows bug)
05:14	<Drk_Guy>	What now
05:14	<ardchoille>	sabgenton: You can try putting a "&" on the end of the command (command &) but it doesn't always work.
05:14	<refefer_>	xtknight: I don't think I made myself understandable, but under each subsection for "screen" it lists my resolutions for each depth, but doesn't specify which one to use
05:14	<xtknight>	refefer_, oh.  it uses the highest by default i believe.
05:14	<coz_>	Pie-rate, oh I see well being that the upgrade will be a new kernerl you will probably still have to reinstall that driver
05:14	<Drk_Guy>	What now???????
05:14	<xtknight>	refefer_, but you change it with system->prefs->screen resolutions
05:14	<xtknight>	refefer_, or ctrl alt PLUS and ctrl alt MINUS
05:15	<linoleum>	Kix: ok I'm going to give a try with anjuta
05:15	<coz_>	Drk_Guy, what have you don so far
05:15	<kbidd>	my computer is rejecting incoming connections -- iptables-save gives an empty output -- any ideas?
05:15	<Pie-rate>	coz_: how do i uninstall the driver?
05:15	<rrittenhouse>	msand: im having the same problem as described here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/5370
05:15	<linoleum>	GionnyBoss: I m going to have a look at eclipse too . Tkx
05:15	<coz_>	Pie-rate, no need to unintsll it
05:15	<xtknight>	solved.  mc wasn't opening RPMs because i needed the 'rpm' package.
05:15	<Drk_Guy>	I have opened the terminal, copy and pasted "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-fonts" in the terminal and it is downloading some files
05:15	<refefer_>	xtknight: the 1280x800 isn't in the screen resolutions selector, only 4:3 resolutions are there
05:15	<wastrel>	kbidd:  could be the specific service config
05:15	<GionnyBoss>	linoleum: anjuta is similar to kdevelop... consider eclipse with c plugin. I use this for my university. There's a good debugger inside, too :)
05:15	<xtknight>	refefer_, yea you have to restart X first
05:15	<Drk_Guy>	But i already have the installer
05:15	<xtknight>	refefer_, after modifying xorg
05:15	<Pie-rate>	coz_: i want to before i do the upgrade

05:16	<zack>	hello guys, one quick question im looking for a deskapp that looks like the default one in DSL linux, its all txt and quite large anyone know what its called?

05:17	<sabgenton>	ardchoille: yes i rember doing that now
05:17	<linoleum>	GionnyBoss: tkx mate I definitly going to try this one too :)
05:17	<zak_>	Possum: you could *probably* run an md5 checksum on /dev/cdrom, and compare it with an md5 checksum recorded on the ubuntu download page [assuming they're put up there] ... someone should be able to help you out

05:19	<coz_>	Pie-rate, yeah they work
05:19	<xtknight>	refefer_, additionally pastebin the output of "xrandr -q".  are you sure you reset you X server because i never saw you quit

05:20	<xtknight>	refefer_, ah hmm ok pastebin the above items i'll check them
05:20	<refefer_>	xtknight: used the X restart keys : )
05:20	<verma>	hey people .. there was this emulation program that could let me logon to my own system in a different x session ... like in a window like vnc ... anybody know what that's called .. xemu or something?

05:21	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: what's your problem? can't you use the resolution you want?
05:21	<refefer_>	GionnyBoss: no, for some reason I can't : (
05:22	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: what can't you do?
05:22	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: ah ok... I have the solution
05:22	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: install 915resolution package ;)
05:22	<xtknight>	refefer_, also output of "xrandr -q"?
05:22	<wastrel>	kbidd:  i assume you can connect to ssh on localhost, and from the LAN.  anything in /etc/hosts.allow and .deny
05:22	<wastrel>	?
05:23	<refefer_>	GionnyBoss: troubles with i810 intel driver?
05:23	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: this solved the problem for me on my laptop with intel integrated graphic card... there's a bug that doesn't let you use different resolution, untill you install this 915resolution package and configure it
05:23	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: yeah
05:23	<kbidd>	wastrel, I just tried localhost, it works, and then from the LAN, and that failed.
05:23	<xtknight>	GionnyBoss, why i810 doesnt let you set the res in xrog ?
05:23	<GionnyBoss>	xtknight: it's not a i810 problem... it's some intel chipset problem
05:23	<Alonea>	also, how do you add a script to your "Session Startup Programs" list in Kubuntu?
05:23	<xtknight>	!kubuntu
05:23	<ubotu>	Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
05:24	<refefer_>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16961/
05:24	<wastrel>	kbidd:  check hosts.allow and .deny
05:24	<xtknight>	refefer_, well odd.  it must be a bug, maybe you do need the 915resolution thing
05:24	<GionnyBoss>	xtknight, refefer_ : with my Dell laptop, I had to install this 915resolution. The chipset has got a bug that "tells" that he can only display some resolution, while in reality he can display more resolutions than those
05:24	<xtknight>	GionnyBoss, ah ok thanks for the advice
05:24	<GionnyBoss>	xtknight: no problem
05:25	<tehseen>	anyone know anything about motorola q ?

05:26	<GionnyBoss>	refefer_: install the package and set it up. Read the man page... it took me some time to configure this 915resolution correctly and now I don't remember exactly to be honest. I would have to read the man again. Install this, read the man, configure it, and restart x

05:36	<cobrien>	roach: nah... was looking to reset the settings so I could use a much higher rez...  I found them.  dpkg-reconfigure
05:36	<noelferreira>	people
05:36	<xange>	msand: I added what the how-to told me to
05:36	<roachk71>	If that's the case, it's 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg'
05:37	<bobesponja>	hey, I've just upgraded from edgy to feisty
05:37	<DanZ3>	I installed vim-gnome from the "add/remove" programs thing and it isnt showing up in my applications menu
05:37	<cobrien>	schweet.. thanks
05:37	<xange>	xtknight: after install nvidia drivers (and switching xorg to use them) its all fuzzy
05:37	<noelferreira>	i need to find a file in /etc/lib. how can i search for it?
05:37	<roachk71>	Oh, ok
05:37	<testingltsp>	help: I've installed edubuntu with LTSP, but unable to login user in terminal, always kicked back to login screen
05:37	<xtknight>	xange, are you using the lcd screen's native resolution?  additionally are you using vga or dvi?
05:37	<bobesponja>	my mouse doesn't work as before, I can't open tabs by clicking on the mouse wheel and I can't past by clicking on the mouse wheel, any idea how to fix it, it's really annoying :(
05:37	<msand>	Comrade-Sergei: That's 1.5 Mb
05:37	<xange>	xtknight: dvi and yes I'm using the native
05:38	<Comrade-Sergei>	ty
05:38	<Comrade-Sergei>	wait
05:38	<peeps>	noelferreira, you can use tab completion if you know the first part of the filename
05:38	<xtknight>	xange, hmm i guess i dont know what fuzzy means.  what's fuzzy?  the fonts?  pictures?  everything?  obviously you can see text fine?
05:38	<testingltsp>	help: I've installed edubuntu with LTSP, but unable to login user in terminal, always kicked back to login screen, reinstalled ubuntu with ltsp, same thing happens
05:38	<J-_>	how can I unsave an auto connected channel from irssi? =S (if that makes sense)
05:38	<Comrade-Sergei>	msand what would 1.5 gb be 15360000 then?
05:38	<tankcat>	how big (in MB) is the upgrade from edgy to feisty?
05:38	<bullgard4>	uUsing ysm I could send a message to my friend but could not receive one. What prerequisite did I not meet?
05:38	<xtknight>	xange, (well i do understand that just because you can see it doesnt mean it's perfect but at least it's not horrible)
05:38	<noelferreira>	peeps: i need to search for a file in my /
05:38	<xange>	xtknight: it differs. some fonts are fuzzy. issi looks about 90% correct
05:38	<peeps>	noelferreira, or you can use the find command.  find -iname path filename
05:38	<wastrel>	bobesponja:  in firefox?
05:39	<xtknight>	xange, and this doesnt happen on nv or vesa?
05:39	<Cosmo_>	I was attempting to upgrade my mother's laptop from 6.10 to 7.04 and I am not sure what she did but when I boot up now on it it goes to the command line and says "/bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off" any way to fix this?
05:39	<xange>	xtknight: not in nv
05:39	<xange>	xtknight: haven't tried vesa
05:39	<bobesponja>	wastrel: firefox for the tabs and everywhere else for pasting
05:39	<xtknight>	xange, that's odd.  have you messed with the gnome font options at all?
05:39	<noelferreira>	peeps: i don't know the path of that file
05:39	<jrib>	DanZ3: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vim/+bug/3222
05:39	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: maybe your mouse is configured as 2 buttons only. Try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and just hit "enter" for all the options that has got nothing to do with your mouse (video card, and that stuff). Just hitting enter will leave the settings that are already setted. When it asks for mouse, if it's set as 2 buttons, change it as 3 buttons and restart x
05:39	<testingltsp>	any ltsp experts here?
05:39	<xange>	xtknight: nope
05:39	<Zaehlas>	Hello all, I've been trying to get sound working for multiple applications at once (namely teamspeak and cedega), however, in all my furustrations, switching from alsa, to OSS 4.0 and now back, a seem to have partially destroyed my linux headers.  I've tried using apt-get to --purge remove and then install again, but I can't make anything right now.  How do I restore the linux headers?
05:39	<xtknight>	xange, if not try enabling lcd subpixel scaling and see if it all looks consistent?  i dont know..
05:39	<xange>	xtknight: its not just fonts
05:39	<blazemonger>	do u think the reason the4 molecule saver froze was cuz i didnt have a custom kernel?
05:39	<Pie-rate>	why can't firefox on ubuntu render ANYTHING properly?
05:39	<testingltsp>	any ubuntu 7.04 + LTSP5 success here?
05:39	<peeps>	noelferreira, use root as the path, it will search recursively
05:39	<xtknight>	xange, what refresh rate are you sending the lcd?  proper frequency range?
05:39	<Comrade-Sergei>	msand what would 1.5 gb be 15360000 then?
05:40	<testingltsp>	any edubuntu 7.04 + LTSP5 success here?
05:40	<atariboy84>	hey guys
05:40	<xtknight>	xange, i would type "sudo nvidia-settings" and look around in there
05:40	<xange>	xtknight: thats what I was trying to figure out...I don't see that setting in xorg.conf at all
05:40	<tankcat>	how big (in MB) is the upgrade from edgy to feisty?
05:40	<thebillywayne>	do I have to restart gdm to initialize 915resolution?
05:40	<peeps>	noelferreira, do it as sudo or you will get a bunch of access denied errors
05:40	<jughead>	thebillywayne, you might have to restart x (ctrl+alt+bksp)
05:41	<testingltsp>	how to grant remote access to user in ubuntu?
05:41	<msand>	Comrade-Sergei: 1536000000  I suppose.  At least, the places should be right
05:41	<jrib>	DanZ3: you should be able to right click on the ubuntu icon >	edit menus  and then enable the gvim entry under "Accessories"
05:41	<thebillywayne>	thx jughead.  i'll try that.
05:41	<EvilDennisR>	wtf is the chmod mode so anyone in a group can add files to a directory owned by someotheruser:group.. I thought it was chmod g+s
05:41	<peeps>	testingltsp, ssh?
05:41	<xtknight>	xange, what setting?
05:41	<xtknight>	xange, you dont see frequency range?
05:41	<Opiate>	How do you list processes and a switch to limit it to 30 or so.
05:41	<xange>	xtknight: yeah! Force Full GPU Scaling fixed it
05:41	<xtknight>	xange, do mess around with "sudo nvidia-settings".  it doesnt use...
05:41	<xtknight>	good job
05:41	<Comrade-Sergei>	msand i think that was my problem
05:41	<testingltsp>	peeps: i think so
05:41	<xange>	thanks xtknight
05:41	<xtknight>	but that would mean youre not using the native res
05:41	<xtknight>	probably
05:41	<Opiate>	In CLI*
05:41	<yashton>	question: I'm running Ubuntu server 7.04, on original install, i selected dvorak keyboard layout, thinking i'd want to try it, but now i want a regular qwerty setup. I've tried to install console-data and run dpkg-config on that. Also tried to use loadkeys, but i can't find where ubuntu stores keyboard layouts.
05:41	<noelferreira>	peeps: find -i ?
05:42	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I need to reconfigure all my xserver, I just tried and it asked me to chose between my keyboards, video cards etc with bad default
05:42	<xtknight>	xange, what does frontend and backend res say?  if they're not the same, you're not on native
05:42	<GaiaX11>	Hi
05:42	<HYPOCRISY>	confidential
05:42	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: yeah.. .but as I told you, just hit "enter" if you don't want to change the current setting
05:42	<testingltsp>	peeps: i tot edubuntu taking care of it, but still can't login to ltsp terminal
05:42	<xange>	xtknight: where do i find that?
05:42	<xtknight>	xange, well the force gpu scaling setting is permanent, no xorg mod needed so i guess you're good to go on that front.  i'd still be curious as to why that fixed it.  as i said if frontend/backend are different then somehow you're not using the native
05:42	<xtknight>	xange, same place as force gpu
05:43	<xange>	xtknight: they match the native
05:43	<xtknight>	xange, and if you un-click force gpu they stil, match?
05:43	<xtknight>	still*
05:44	<thebillywayne>	well, I've followed the 915resolution instructions exactly, and I still can't get either 1600x1200 or 1440x900.  any ideas?
05:44	<noelferreira>	peeps: i need to find this file dvb-ttpci-01.fw in my entire system. what would be the command?
05:44	<xange>	xtknight: yeah
05:44	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: you should have for all xserver settings the current value, so if you hit "enter" key you just leave the current setting for that thing. When it asks for mouse, be sure that it's setted right
05:44	<Doughy>	I think Beryl overwrote some of my gnome settings and now I am having re-login problems.  Does anyone know how I can re-install gnome to reset my config files without losing anything?
05:44	<xtknight>	xange, well that's very odd. oh well, must be a bug
05:44	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, did you try #edubuntu ? people there are more likely to have used it
05:44	<pipegeek>	Hi, folks.  Just had a quick question about a bit of weirdness in the version of gnome that ships with feisty, and I'm wondering if anyone can reproduce it.  The panel trash bin doesn't seem to respond to being full, on a new, clean install.  That is, it doesn't matter whether there's anything in the trash; the bin always appears empty, and so can't be emptied, except by actually opening the trash and emptying it from the resulting nautilus w
05:44	<pipegeek>	indow.  Can anyone confirm this?
05:44	<peeps>	noelferreira, sudo find / -name dvb-ttpci-01.fw
05:44	<xtknight>	xange, oh woops i should be asking you to compare frontend/backend and native, not frontend TO backend
05:44	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I've tested edubuntu & ubuntu, the result is the same
05:44	<xtknight>	xange, ideally they should all be the same under force gpu and no force gpu
05:44	<peeps>	noelferreira, or use iname.  the difference is that iname is case insensitive
05:44	<xange>	xtknight: i dunno, I have a Samsung Syncmaster 930b if that means anything to you :)
05:45	<xtknight>	xange, definitely does..  1280x1024@60Hz would be native for that
05:45	<Cosmo_>	I was attempting to upgrade my mother's laptop from 6.10 to 7.04 and I am not sure what she did but when I boot up now on it it goes to the command line and says "/bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off" any way to fix this?
05:45	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I mean 7.04
05:45	<GionnyBoss>	thebillywayne: yeah. You have to be sure that you configured it correctly and then you have to be sure that 915resolution it's booted on system boot. Use "bum" (sudo apt-get install bum), Boot Up Manager, and be sure that from bum you select 915resolution to start on boot
05:45	<xange>	xtknight: all three are the same
05:45	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: ok I guess I need to restart X
05:45	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, i know, but the edubuntu folks will have used ltsp more than most people in here, hence will likely know more
05:45	<pipegeek>	This isn't true of the desktop trash icon, which can be enabled by editing gconf.
05:45	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: yeah
05:45	<xtknight>	xange, yup must be a bug.  oh well, it's just your lucky day that you found that fix ;P
05:45	<xange>	xtknight: no matter if I have force full on are off
05:45	<Zaehlas>	Hello all, I've been trying to get sound working for multiple applications at once (namely teamspeak and cedega), however, in all my furustrations, switching from alsa, to OSS 4.0 and now back, a seem to have partially destroyed my linux headers.  I've tried using apt-get to --purge remove and then install again, but I can't make anything right now.  How do I restore the linux headers?
05:45	<xtknight>	xange, if youre feeling ambitious maybe file a bug with nvidia?
05:45	<xange>	xtknight: guess so :-D
05:45	<wastrel>	pipegeek:  try removing and re-adding the trash applet to the panel
05:45	<Kazol>	how do I change the color of the font in the bottom panel?
05:45	<xange>	xtknight: if you give me a link..sure :)
05:45	<wastrel>	pipegeek:  mine works fine
05:46	<xtknight>	xange, haha too lazy
05:46	<GaiaX11>	!gutsy
05:46	<ubotu>	Gutsy Gibbon is the code name for the next release of Ubuntu (7.10). See https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyReleaseSchedule Support in #ubuntu+1
05:46	<pipegeek>	wastrel: already did.  Twice :^)
05:46	<xtknight>	xange, naw hold on
05:46	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: yes, edubuntu is easy to setup ltsp, I found ubuntu do easy to install
05:46	<thebillywayne>	thx GionnyBoss, i'll try that.
05:46	<xtknight>	xange, there is actually an Xorg  setting for the GPU scaling too.. though that box in nvidia-settings should be permanent. it must write to another file
05:46	<Pie-rate>	Zaehlas: linux sound systems are a bitch, eh?
05:46	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu: I'm using edubuntu now, the ltsp terminal still not allow me to login
05:47	<Zaehlas>	Pie-rate YES!  =D
05:47	<xange>	yay. beryl is dope!
05:47	<Doughy>	I think Beryl overwrote some of my gnome settings and now I am having re-login problems.  Does anyone know how I can re-install gnome to reset my config files without losing anything?
05:47	<Doughy>	no beryl sucks
05:47	<GionnyBoss>	thebillywayne: it's not easy to configure this 915resolution... I lost a lot of time doing it. For example I setted my 1440x900 resolution of the list (that it was a number, something like 4c) as 640x480. And then just added "640x480" in my xorg.conf. After this, for 640x480 the x server will see 1440x900 instead
05:47	<filch>	heh
05:47	<Doughy>	overwrote my configs and now my gnome is hosed
05:47	<peeps>	what is ltsp?
05:47	<yashton>	Zaehlas: yeah, sound has been very tough in all linux distros. Hopefully ubuntu studio will do some better kernel/driver things.
05:47	<yell8w>	hey folks, i check my router, firewall and sshd. all are open/running, and still i can't access using the public ip (everything's fine with the local ip ) what should i do ?
05:47	<ReePigBree>	I can not freshclam in the terminal! :(
05:47	<elkbuntu>	testingltsp, what i'm saying is the people in #edubuntu will probably be *more likely* to know the answer to your problem
05:47	<pipegeek>	Anyone else?  Just curious
05:47	<peeps>	noelferreira, did that find it?
05:47	<Doughy>	Beryl = garbage until they get some stability
05:47	<testingltsp>	elkbuntu, ohh hahaha I'm in wrong channel, thanks
05:47	<cobrien>	How would I restart my mouse daemon?
05:47	<xtknight>	xange, "When emailing linux-bugs@nvidia.com, please attach an nvidia-bug-report.log, which is generated by running "nvidia-bug-report.sh"."
05:48	<filch>	yell8w: you'll have to forward the port to the internal machine if your router is doing a nat
05:48	<cobrien>	My mouse cursor disappeared after unsuccessfully loading beryl.
05:48	<xtknight>	xange, and that command will work even on restricted drivers
05:48	<xtknight>	xange, i guess that's all you  gotta do
05:48	<yell8w>	filch, already did
05:48	<Alonea>	The APT Database could not be opened! I tried the adept lock fix thing and that didn't work.
05:48	<ReePigBree>	I can not update, my Clamav, I need help!
05:48	<Zaehlas>	yashton: Well, technically my current problem isn't sound, but compiling anything on my system cause I trashed my linux headers.  what do I do to completely restore them?   using apt-get to remove then install again is NOT resoring the files I'm missing apparently.
05:48	<thebillywayne>	GionnyBoss, so you set one for the other?
05:48	<yell8w>	filch, i'm looking at the router port forwarding page
05:48	<noelferreira>	thanks peeps
05:48	<noelferreira>	yes peeps
05:48	<peeps>	yw
05:49	<filch>	yell8w: do you see anything in the log on the linux box you're trying to hit?
05:49	<james296>	how can I change my Ubuntu boot screen back to its default after getting KDE?
05:49	<xange>	xtknight: k, I'll take care of that right now
05:49	<xtknight>	xange, thanks for taking the time
05:49	<yashton>	zaehlas: linux headers should be fixed with apt-get, not sure why that would be a problem. when in doubt do a clean install of it. *Shrug*
05:49	<jrib>	!usplash >	james296    (james296, see the private message from ubotu)
05:49	<yell8w>	filch, heh, didn't think of that, one sec
05:49	<blazemonger>	do u think the reason the4 molecule saver froze was cuz i didnt have a custom kernel?
05:50	<james296>	wherre do I go to remember that?
05:50	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: still the same
05:50	<wastrel>	blazemonger:  i think it's because you don't have 3d acceleration set up
05:50	<yashton>	i'm trying to change my keyboard layout in the console on Ubuntu Server, any ideas?
05:50	<blazemonger>	i have a rage 128
05:50	<Burgundavia>	yashton: #ubuntu-server for server support
05:50	<blazemonger>	and i was told it supported opengl
05:50	<binskipy2u>	hey can someone tell me if they got VIRTUALBOX to work on ubuntu and/or if its in the repos?
05:50	<blazemonger>	so i have to buy a new video card?
05:50	<GionnyBoss>	thebillywayne: yeah the idea was like that... I discovered this after trying a lot. Unfortunately I don't have my laptop here now to check it (my father has got it now)
05:50	<xtknight>	yashton, sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
05:50	<yashton>	burgundavia: thanks no links on the website for that.
05:50	<boss>	Hmm, this is definitely a bug.
05:50	<MTecknology>	Is there an update for vmware server so that I can update to 7.04?
05:50	<blazemonger>	man no wonder im starting to hate pc's
05:50	<yashton>	exit
05:51	<blazemonger>	nothing will run properly on my hardware
05:51	<boss>	http://sial.org/howto/kickstart/partition/desktop ->	that kickstart configuration snippet is supposed to get the root filesystem and its underlings to format properly.
05:51	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: that's strange. The mouse is set as 3 buttons mouse? I told you to do this thing just to check that in xorg conf the mouse was setted as 3 buttons mouse
05:51	<wil_syd>	Anyone using mt-daapd ? Which has to start first.. avahi or mt-daapd ?
05:51	<binskipy2u>	anyone here using virtualbox in fiesty?
05:51	<boss>	However, with the Ubuntu alternate install CD providing the ks option the appropriate path seems to work for everything but partitioning.
05:51	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: i did select the 3 buttons mouse option
05:52	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	What's the trick to making the tty login work?
05:52	<boss>	It gets a "No root filesystem defined" error and I can't define a root filesystem because Ubuntu seems to recurse back to that error.
05:52	<testingltsp>	anybody success with ubuntu 7.04 with LTSP5?
05:52	<testingltsp>	anybody success with ubuntu 7.04 + LTSP5?
05:52	<boss>	If anyone else has seen this error, *please* let me know so that I can report it as a bug to Launchpa.d
05:52	<peeps>	binskipy2u, I have used virtualbox on Fedora Core 5, but not Ubuntu. I couldn't get it to compile from source, and just ended up installing the binary package from the Virtualboc website
05:52	<boss>	Launchpad even.
05:52	<bobesponja>	GionnyBoss: plus, before I did the upgrade to feisty it used to work with edgy and I didn't touch my xorg.conf during the upgrade so I guess it's more a driver problem or something no?
05:52	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: ok so at least now we now that this is correct. Unfortunately I don't know what else you should check.
05:53	<reubs>	I'm  trying to get hyperthreading going on my p4.... any takers?
05:53	<blazemonger>	i was told that a radeon 7000 PCI would make my system 30% slower than a ATI Rage 128 card
05:53	<xtknight>	boss, even if only you are having the problem just report it anyway.  it could be a problem with your particular system config and the people on launchpad will take care of it
05:53	<bradyc>	yeah, I'm having this problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2478428
05:53	<bradyc>	I'm glad I'm not the only one.
05:53	<JACKBAUER_AL>	Unix bsd Users?
05:53	<xtknight>	reubs, HT should be enabled on an smp/SMT or generic kernel
05:53	<blazemonger>	compiz/beryl wont even run with my rage 128
05:53	<concept10>	reubs, hyperthreading is disabled in the ubuntu kernel
05:53	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: I don't know what it could be, really. I thought that it was a xorg.conf configuration problem. Unfortunately I don't have other idea... try to say your problem again here and wait for other people's help. Sorry. Good luck!
05:54	<xtknight>	concept10, per what?
05:54	<yell8w>	filch, funny thing is, i can't even ping the public ip ? #_#
05:54	<taggie>	blazemonger, i'm using a radeon 7000, it's no gaming machine, but it's a great desktop and supports compiz
05:54	<reubs>	xtknight: so i have to get the generic kernel and it should be good?
05:54	<concept10>	xtknight, per look at the config
05:54	<reubs>	thanks concept10
05:54	<bradyc>	bobesponja: nvidia restricted and only 800x600?
05:54	<xtknight>	reubs, as far as i can tell that should be the case

05:54	<Doughy>	anyone?

05:55	<boss>	This error is very close to what I'm getting but not quite it.
05:55	<boss>	It's labeled as medium priority: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kickseed/+bug/48311
05:55	<yell8w>	filch, ssh works fine with the 192.168x ips, not the other one
05:55	<concept10>	xtknight, it hasnt been build with ht enabled for at least 1.5 years or more
05:55	<bradyc>	bobesponja: np sorry.
05:55	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure how it is possible to exclude HT ?
05:55	<xtknight>	concept10, whats the config option name?
05:56	<boss>	medium priority bug confirmed yet not assigned to anyone :\
05:56	<bradyc>	I'm running both cores on an AMD64... not sure about HT though.
05:56	<concept10>	xtknight, i dont know, you have to find it
05:56	<xtknight>	amd64 doesnt have HT
05:56	<xtknight>	concept10, HT is a bios and cpu level thing
05:56	<bradyc>	yes, I know that.
05:56	<xtknight>	concept10, windows 2k can use it without any updates, etc
05:56	<filch>	yell8w: but if you're coming from one of the internal addresses on that subnet, and you're trying to hit the public ip of the router, the router may be doing something weird cuz it sees you coming from within the network, and not as a true external connection
05:56	<GionnyBoss>	bobesponja: that options looks right. Try to ask here again first... I'm a normal user like you, and I just tried to help... guess there could be more expert people here that can help you
05:56	<acidtabs>	Can anyone help me install sauerbraten plz
05:57	<xtknight>	concept10, HT appears to the OS as a dual CPU config nothing more nothing less
05:57	<xtknight>	thus an smp kernel will work
05:57	<yell8w>	filch, so it's my router's acting up? i mean i'm getting internet and stuff
05:57	<yell8w>	that's how i'm talking to you
05:57	<concept10>	xtknight, it doesnt
05:57	<Cosmo_>	anyone have a link to the 7.04 desktop torrent ?
05:57	<xtknight>	there are some mentions of needing to type "ht=on" at the kernel boot line
05:57	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: it should be so easy using sauerbraten... just extract the archive and launch it, if I remember right
05:57	<xange>	xtknight: ok, send the e-mail out for ya...I'm going to go take advantage of beryl...enjoy your right and thanks again
05:58	<xtknight>	xange, cool
05:58	<xange>	s/send/sent/
05:58	<jason_>	sup all
05:58	<braveheartlion>	i've just burned a ubuntu iso onto a cd. how can i check whether the burn is perfect?
05:58	<concept10>	xtknight, therefore its not enabled by default
05:58	<xiambax>	does the new release support intel based macs?
05:58	<yell8w>	filch, also, i have an apache running, doesn't see it
05:58	<acidtabs>	i did try to run the game after extracting it but it does not want to start
05:58	<bradyc>	braveheartlion: boot the CD and run the checker util
05:58	<Lgndryh1>	hi.....how is everyone
05:58	<bradyc>	or actually you can open it in windows too IIRC
05:58	<xtknight>	concept10, i'm not sure about feisty though
05:59	<filch>	yell8w: with port forwarding, if a connection to the external ip is initiated from a private address behind the router/firewall doing the forwarding, it tends not to work, as its expecting the connection to come from outside the network, not initiated from an address on it's private network. to test this you'd want someone on the outside to try to hit the ip on the specified ports
05:59	<phixnay>	I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
05:59	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	In Edgy, all I did was post my name and password at the tty prompt and I got into that level,  Feisty isn't letting me in though with that procedure, anyone have an idea of what to do?
05:59	<fizz_>	guys just installed 7.04, no MP3 will play, where can codecs for noatun etc.
05:59	<xtknight>	concept10, it must only be ubuntu that is like that because i have had a P4 cpu and it was detectd SMP just fine under suse, etc
05:59	<filch>	yell8w: i've seen this with firewalls i use at work for various things
05:59	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro
05:59	<jrib>	fizz_: did you try double clicking on an mp3?
05:59	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: so it's not a sauerbraten installation problem... can you paste in pastebin the error output you get, please?
05:59	<jrib>	fizz_: (in nautilus)
05:59	<bradyc>	fizz, check out the multimedia forums on the ubuntu site, there is a sticky on that subject.
05:59	<fizz_>	jrd, will do that now
05:59	<fania>	hai
05:59	<yell8w>	filch, pm ?
=== mantrala is now known as bujji
06:00	<concept10>	xtknight, that maybe the case, but not in ubuntu.  Some people disable HT because in some cases, it may reduce performance.
06:00	<xtknight>	reubs, place ht=on at the boot line to make sure you have hyperthreading
=== bujji is now known as mantrala
06:00	<Lgndryh1>	I was wondering if i should update to the new distro.....I am currently at 6.10
06:00	<acidtabs>	gionnyboss there is no error when i click run it just closes
06:00	<chainer827>	hello....I cannot install software currently on ubuntu....keeps giving me an error....can anyone help me solve this?
06:01	<phixnay>	what software?
06:01	<braveheartlion>	bradyc: thank you very much.
06:01	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: open a terminal and try to start it from a terminal. There you should have some error output
06:01	<reubs>	xtknight: yah, i had already done that but i was looking thro the logs and saw it was refusing to see the next one. is it worth compling my own kernel?
06:01	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of the text at the bottom panel??
06:01	<acidtabs>	let me check
06:01	<xtknight>	reubs, hmm maybe.  the kernel must be deliberately disabling HT, to which i'm very surprised
06:01	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: cd /path/to/your/sauerbraten/folder     and then:  ./sauerbraten
06:02	<xtknight>	reubs, so i'm not even sure a recompiled kernel would work either.
06:02	<phixnay>	Hey, I have a question about upgrading to feisty - why doesn't my cd drive work anymore?
06:02	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: uhm, sorry... ./sauerbraten_unix
06:02	<linoleum_>	ok I 've got a simple question : I search of an IDE. I found Geany, which is new (less than 1 year of development), and I found it on synaptic ... but then I found OpenLDev , and I wanted to install it with synaptic. but I can't find this one. that s strange because it's a 2year and half project, and they finaly reached the 1.0 version . Why can't I find it with synaptic ?
06:02	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Does anyone know how to crack open a tty prompt in Feisty?
06:02	<Kazol>	Does anyone here know howto change the color of the text at the bottom table?
06:02	<Lathiat>	wil_syd: avahi
06:02	<xtknight>	reubs, but give it a try. i swear my P4 HT was SMP when i had one...but i never did try ubuntu linux, only other distros like suse
06:02	<concept10>	xtknight, you shouldnt be surprised.  I told you in some cases HT reduces performance.  Also, HT is not the same as SMP
06:02	<acidtabs>	i click on display and it pop up with something
06:02	<mhykgyver>	hello everyone
06:02	<acidtabs>	i guess these are errors
06:03	<mhykgyver>	ubuntu newbie here
06:03	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: thanks
06:03	<reubs>	xtknight: thanks alot tho :) i think its disabled by default as the hyperthreading is a security risk
06:03	<chainer827>	I can't access synaptic anymore...or remove and install software on feisty....need some help
06:03	<phixnay>	linoleum_: beats me. try just searching for Open. you can always download a package of it somewhere
06:03	<xtknight>	reubs, ya i guess
06:03	<acidtabs>	its on my desktop
06:03	<Shaba1>	guys
06:03	<Shaba1>	how do I check my sound system
06:03	<Drk_Guy>	Hy
06:03	<phixnay>	chainer827: why not?
06:03	<acidtabs>	how would i do that if its located on my desktop BOss
06:03	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: on display? where? you don't have to click anywere. Just open a terminal and try to start the game from there
06:03	<bullgard4>	Using ysm I could send a message to my friend but could not receive one. What prerequisite did I not meet?
06:03	<Alonea>	ok, my adept/apt whatever is messed up. I can do apt-get update and thats it.
06:03	<mhykgyver>	uhmmm i hope u won't mind me asking but how can i install glib in ubuntu?
06:03	<Drk_Guy>	I am still unable of installing Java
06:04	<Shaba1>	all of a sudden I am not getting any audio on dvds or screen cast in xubuntu
06:04	<chainer827>	I installed the Ubuntu Wireless support software, and it basically made it crash
06:04	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of system font?
06:04	<acidtabs>	i tryed to open terminal but it just closes up just like run
06:04	<Alonea>	if I try to install something I get E: Invalid record in the preferences file, no Package header
06:04	<acidtabs>	did
06:04	<phixnay>	chainer827: so what can you do now? can you login?
06:04	<wil_syd>	Lathiat: just noted in Feisty Avahi is S50 and mt-daapd is S20
06:04	<chainer827>	yes....on my computer now....just can't install, upgrade, or uninstall software
06:05	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: do you have 3d drivers installed and configured correctly for your graphic card? and then be sure that you installed SDL :)
06:05	<acidtabs>	my grafics are installed whats sdl?
06:05	<acidtabs>	and how would i get it
06:05	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: sdl library is fundamental to run this game
06:05	<acidtabs>	ic
06:05	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: don't remember exactly the name... search in Synaptic for packages like "SDL" or "libsdl" and install them
06:06	<phixnay>	chainer827: alright, I'm not a pro at linux or anything... but try opening a terminal, and doing "sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade"
06:06	<newuser>	hello
06:06	<phixnay>	hi
06:06	<newuser>	iam having trouble with usplash ; has anyone had success with installing usplash on kubuntu 7.04
06:06	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: a lot of games for linux (sauerbraten included) use sdl libraries
06:06	<chainer827>	yeah...tried those....it gives me an error message saying Dynamic MMap ran out of room
06:07	<phixnay>	chainer827: whoa, I have no idea what that means
06:07	<acidtabs>	with one should i download thats tons of them
06:07	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	I agree that tty is invaluable to editing files in certain cases and it is in Ubuntu so it should work.  :\
06:07	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?
06:07	<peeps>	chainer827, how much ram do you have?
06:07	<acidtabs>	i just don't want to install something that would mess my system up
06:07	<chainer827>	I have 1.5 GB Ram
06:07	<phixnay>	0.o
06:07	<CactusDeity>	hi
06:07	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: why should a library mess up your system? :S
06:08	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: go and search on google what a library is
06:08	<EnsignRedshirt>	linoleum_: The openldev download page has an ubuntu .deb file.
06:08	<GionnyBoss>	acidtabs: if you don't trust me, go and search there
06:08	<acidtabs>	ill try to install some and see
06:08	<Moosejaw>	could feisty be effecting how my NIC's range is effected with my router?
06:09	<phixnay>	chainer827: what happens when you try to use synaptic or update manager?
06:09	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: effecting? what do you exactly mean?
06:09	<Alonea>	E: Invalid record in the preferences file, no Package header...using apt-get and adept
06:09	<Shaba1>	Hello
06:09	<Shaba1>	how do I check my sound system
06:09	<chainer827>	i keep getting an error message with that saying error occurred while using xcal
06:09	<Shaba1>	all of a sudden I am not getting any audio on dvds or screen cast in xubuntu
06:09	<linoleum_>	EnsignRedshirt: yes I know , I just wonder why it's not in the repository (universe or multiverse)
06:10	<peeps>	Shaba1, can you get sound in any programs?
06:10	<phixnay>	shaba1: if you had to manually install kernel modules to get sound to work, you have to install them again each time you upgrade your kernel
06:10	<cesar_>	hello
06:10	<Kazol>	How do I change the color of system font?
06:10	<cesar_>	i have just updated my ubuntu to the new version
06:10	<Shaba1>	phixnayI hafe not done any kernal upgrades
06:11	<cesar_>	does anyone know why my device hard drive names have changed from /dev/hda1 or /dev/hda2 to /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2??
06:11	<Shaba1>	I hardly know whta the linux keral is
06:11	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, hahahaa
06:11	<tankcat>	i'm feeling adventerous. someone suggests a cool windows manager i should try
06:11	<concept10>	xtknight, check this out, I have a couple of systems with p4 HT http://img183.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotsa1.png
06:11	<Shaba1>	all I have recently done is install camaoram
06:11	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	nice one
06:11	<xjkx>	whats the similar to adept-installer that COMES BY DEFAULT on ubuntu?
06:11	<bradyc>	cesar_: SATA drives will be seen as SDA
06:11	<peeps>	cesar_, did you swap your cables around recently?
06:11	<Shaba1>	and that sound was working even after I installed that
06:11	<phixnay>	chainer827: try running top to see if you have anything using up resources, or if there's anything else shifty going on
06:11	<Shaba1>	but now it seems not to work
06:11	<MTecknology>	I'm trying to upgrade to 7.04 through the update manager and I get an error
06:11	<MTecknology>	These are my resulting files in /var/log/dist-upgrade/ http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16964/ - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16966/
06:11	<cesar_>	im sorry, i mean sda1 and sdb1
06:11	<wil_syd>	bradyc: so to IDE (PATA)
06:12	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: what do you mean? I need to change the color of the text on the bottom panel.
06:12	<bradyc>	Oh?  That's kinda nuts.
06:12	<cesar_>	no i havent changed or moved anything, all i did was update ubuntu
06:12	<cesar_>	i had to change my /etc/fstab file
06:12	<cesar_>	because it wouldnt mount my home directory
06:12	<bradyc>	wil_syd: is that a bug?
06:12	<dougb>	i'm having problems with LAMP, i installed all the proper packages and it all went well, but i heard that I can create "public_html" in my home directory and type in "http://localhost/~username/" as a web address and it would reroute to the proper folder, but it didn't
06:12	<mister_roboto>	xjkx: synaptic
06:13	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonSchnauz: I do not get your humor about changing font colors.
06:13	<chowmeined>	how do I edit ogg theora files? I tried opening them with Kino but it fails
06:13	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, just a sarcastic remark,  colored system fonts isn't a feature with Ubuntu
06:13	<wil_syd>	bradyc: no.. by design... all moved under the scsi layer like usb drives.
06:13	<quaal>	ok so if i setup a shared printer with the URI http://192.168.0.7:631/printers/officejet_5500_series and i print a test page, it says Printing 1 jobs and then the job goes away and printer status goes back to ready, everything is working fine on the ubuntu end? I'm not getting any printout
06:13	<bulmer>	dougb you have the correct apache configuration?
06:13	<dougb>	it's all default
06:13	<chainer827>	it has something to do with the package files that synaptic accesses
06:13	<dougb>	the tutorial i went by didn't talk about needing to configure apache
06:13	<peeps>	Kazol, do you mean for the command line, or the fonts in your desktop environment?
06:13	<cesar_>	anyone know why the ubuntu upgrade would just go ahead and change the device names... ?
06:13	<phixnay>	Shaba1: what happens if you click on the volume adjustor in the menu bar
06:14	<Kazol>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: so there is no way to change the color of the text at the bottom panel (that shows the open programs)?
06:14	<mister_roboto>	cesar_: you mean the disk drives?
06:14	<phixnay>	cesar: cause it's using libsata or something now
06:14	<bulmer>	dougb you need to learn a little bit about apache
06:14	<bradyc>	wil_syd: odd...
06:14	<cesar_>	my hard drives
06:14	<bobesponja>	clicking with my mouse wheel still not working :(
06:14	<concept10>	xtknight, where did you find info on that kernel boot option?
06:14	<dougb>	bulmer: thats why i'm here
06:14	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, I would like to thank you for posting a message to me.  atleast I know now that my posts are making it abroad.  :)
06:14	<xtknight>	concept10, yeah i understand..HT is not enabled by default
06:14	<cesar_>	i just find it weird that it wouldnt tell me and didnt ask me if i wanted to change
06:14	<cesar_>	my etc fstab file
06:14	<wil_syd>	!ata >	wil_syd
06:14	<mister_roboto>	cesar_: i don't know why but i find it kind of irritating. the old way was much more readable :)
06:15	<bulmer>	dougb this is not apache channel, there is one if you so inclined  #apache
06:15	<xtknight>	concept10, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=895077
06:15	<cesar_>	well i changed it now so now it works, but i thought i had lost my hard drive lol
06:15	<wilberfan>	is there a trick to getting .mkv files to run under feisty?!  none of my players will run 'em...
06:15	<bradyc>	cesar_: I agree if they are going to change it like that on you, they should update common files that point to said names.
06:15	<concept10>	xtknight, okay, thanks
06:15	<peeps>	Kazol, there should be some gnome display preferences somewhere where you can set that(assuming you are running gnome).  I am in XFCE right now, so I can't really look to tell you
06:15	<alienseer23>	trying to configure lirc, I followed this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install_Lirc_Feisty and every time I try to load ANY module, ($ sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start) it fails. I really don't know...?
06:15	<AlexC>	how do you uninstall from a command line?
06:15	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Kazol, right, I'm reminded of Henry Ford's comment..........  "You can have any color, as long as it's black."
06:15	<phixnay>	cesar: you're lucky - at least yours still work. My cdrom drive doesn't work at all any more, and no one seems to be able to fix it
06:15	<phixnay>	they all ignore me
06:15	<wilberfan>	i'm almost positive i have all my codecs installed...
06:16	<se2131>	is fiesty freezing extremely often for anyone else?  I have a Toshiba Satellite w/ an ATI Radeon 9100 fyi
06:16	<chainer827>	phixnay: I believe it has something to do with the source and package files that synaptic accesses
06:16	<bulmer>	AlexC uninstall? can you elaborate?
06:16	<testingltsp>	anybody tested LTSP5?
06:16	<madman91>	the plethora of ubuntu users disable it from giving adequate help..
06:16	<cesar_>	im worried now, i actually havent tried my disk drives
06:16	<SeveredCross>	/join #perl
06:16	<SeveredCross>	Oops.
06:16	<AlexC>	bulmer, i need to uninstall nvidia-glx, i removed a graphics card
06:16	<alienseer23>	anybody know anything about using a remote control with ubuntu??
06:16	<madman91>	too high of a problem:problemsolver ratio
06:16	<phixnay>	chainer827: in that case, try making sure your sources.list is ok
06:16	<phixnay>	cesar: good luck
06:17	<Kazol>	where do I configure programs to automatically open with specific filetypes?
06:17	<madman91>	alienseer23: what do you mean? remote host.. like controllling another computer?
06:17	<madman91>	alienseer23: if so.. VNC
06:17	<acidtabs>	Thank you much Gionny Boss
06:17	<chainer827>	phixnay: how do i do that?
06:17	<cesar_>	should i reinstall ubuntu?
06:17	<bofh80>	AlexC, and what graphics card is it running on now?
06:17	<madman91>	alienseer23: no you mean a remote control.. like TV?
06:17	<alienseer23>	madman91: sorry, no I mean remote control as in TV
06:17	<testingltsp>	alienseer23: TV remote control in Ubuntu
06:17	<AlexC>	bofh80, none, i removed it
06:17	<phixnay>	chainer827: try "locate "sources.list"
06:17	<phixnay>	whoops, double quotes
06:17	<concept10>	xtknight, i only know because ive never seen it running.. but im about to reboot and see if it works.
06:18	<testingltsp>	alienseer23: what application u r going to use with?
06:18	<eternaljoy>	is there a newsreader like newsleecher for Ubuntu that also supports SSL?
06:18	<phixnay>	"locate sources.list"
06:18	<madman91>	alienseer23: then I have NOOOooooo idea
06:18	<ninjabob7>	my time keeps jumping forward on feisty amd64
06:18	<xtknight>	concept10, ah alright
06:18	<bofh80>	AlexC, LOL, well "apt-get remove nvidia-glx" if i'm not mistaken . . .
06:18	<jbernhardt>	hey why doesn't my ubuntu detect my dvd sometimes?
06:18	<madman91>	eternaljoy: if you find one like it.. please tell me
06:18	<Kazol>	how can I make it so that vlc automatically opens when I open an .avi file?
06:18	<AlexC>	bofh80 ty
06:18	<bulmer>	AlexC: something like apt-get remove package i believe
06:18	<eternaljoy>	madman91: ditto
06:18	<alienseer23>	testingltsp: media players like vlc, amaorok
06:18	<cesar_>	my hard drives are IDE and not SCSI, why are they sda1/ sdb1??
06:19	<cesar_>	stupid
06:19	<xtknight>	cesar_, feisty uses libata
06:19	<alienseer23>	testingltsp: perhaps openoffice or some powerpoint if possible
06:19	<phixnay>	chainer827: it looks like sources.list is here "/etc/apt/sources.list"
06:19	<xtknight>	libata makes all IDEs appear that way
06:19	<cesar_>	whats that mean
06:19	<wil_syd>	cesar_: you must change... the way of the future... there was a mailing list post about it.... should be fully automagic.
06:19	<se2131>	is fiesty extremely unstable for anyone else?  Edgy worked fine for me and neither the beta or the final release can stay up for more than 20 minutes w/o crashing
06:19	<blazemonger>	I am close to smashing this piece of shit computer
06:19	<chainer827>	phixnay: everything looks fine there.  I believe it is the package lists...it keeps telling me this file has something wrong with it: E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_universe_binary-i386_Packages
06:19	<xtknight>	cesar_, libata is something in the kernel.  i dont know why they did it that way, but that's the way it is for Feisty
06:19	<blazemonger>	i have spent all week trying to get a midi sequencer working
06:19	<cesar_>	i doubt my cdrom drive will work
06:19	<blazemonger>	and rosegarden isnt showing the plugins
06:19	<xtknight>	cesar_, sure it will be fine
06:19	<paradon>	Anyone know if the Feisty server cd installs pptp-linux by default?
06:19	<cesar_>	/dev/hdd doenst exist anymore
06:19	<xtknight>	cesar_, my IDE /dev/hdx etc changed to /dev/sdc something and they work
06:20	<eternaljoy>	is there a newsreader like newsleecher for Ubuntu that also supports SSL?
06:20	<blazemonger>	and there's no midi support on my card and i cant figure out how to use timidity even after reading the documents
06:20	<alienseer23>	testingltsp: I followed the directions here for lirc https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install_Lirc_Feisty to no avail
06:20	<jbernhardt>	hey does anyone know why it won't play my dvd
06:20	<phixnay>	chainer827: this is getting way over my head - I'm sorry I can't really help you out that much
06:20	<ninjabob7>	what might be changing the time?
06:20	<xtknight>	eternaljoy, i'd just run newsleecher under vmware

06:20	<Tarkus>	anyone know how i can install Java JRE? it wont work using add/remove for some reason. any suggestions?
06:20	<eternaljoy>	!newsreader
06:20	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about newsreader - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
06:20	<cesar_>	xtnight, i had to change my /etc/fstab by hand
06:20	<eternaljoy>	how come no newsreader exists for Ubuntu?
06:20	<chainer827>	can anyone help me with this error message: E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_universe_binary-i386_Packages
06:20	<cesar_>	which is not a big deal but im just saying
06:21	<Crazytom>	how can i get a dmesg output from a computer that locked up and had to be rebooted?
06:21	<phixnay>	cesar_: is your cdrom working?
06:21	<xtknight>	eternaljoy, there are lots acutally.  take a look at thunderbird firstly
06:21	<kahrytan>	yo
06:21	<xtknight>	cesar_, ah well i didnt even have to touch fstab
06:21	<se2131>	is there any way that I can see why my computer crashed after the fact?
06:21	<kahrytan>	I just finished installing Feisty.
06:21	<eternaljoy>	xtknight: thunderbird sucks as a newsreader
06:21	<chowmeined>	How do I edit video thats already in ogg theora or mpeg?
06:21	<bulmer>	xtknight: is your vmware guest os accessable from another puter? do you have to enable forwarding or iptables to let it become reachable?
06:21	<xtknight>	eternaljoy, wow ok
06:21	<xtknight>	very descriptive
06:21	<xtknight>	heh
06:21	<Shaba1>	anyone have any ideas
06:21	<Shaba1>	on my sound issues
06:21	<Shaba1>	??
06:21	<paradon>	eternaljoy: try Pan
06:21	<bofh80>	eternaljoy, i just think it sucks :D
06:22	<kahrytan>	eternaljoy: But Firefox has some good newsreader extentions.
06:22	<blazemonger>	anyone have ANY idea how i can get software midi synth to work with even fluidsynth
06:22	<xtknight>	se2131, sometimes there are logs that end in .1 indicating the 'last boot'
06:22	<xtknight>	se2131, see /var/log/
06:22	<pppoe_dude>	pwnge
06:22	<blazemonger>	people that made this stuff difficult on purpose
06:22	<bulmer>	Tarkus: what have you done to try installing java jre?
06:22	<xtknight>	bulmer, i haven't actually tried accessing the vmware guest OS shared folders from another PC.  they work flawlessly every time locally
06:22	<eternaljoy>	kahrytan: like what?
06:22	<eternaljoy>	!pan
06:22	<pppoe_dude>	se2131, syslog
06:22	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about pan - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
06:22	<GButler>	I'm having a ton of trouble with a Fiesty install; is there anyone here who might be able to help me?
06:22	<se2131>	xtknight, ok, I have apport.log.1, btmp.1, dpkg.log.1, scrollkeeper.log.1, and wtmp.1
06:22	<Lathiat>	wil_syd: ah ok

=== christopher is now known as Kristano
06:23	<eternaljoy>	paradon: does Pan support SSL?
06:23	<paradon>	eternaljoy: dunno... one sec, I'll check.
06:23	<xtknight>	se2131, hmm well check /var/crash also.  those logs you listed wouldnt indicate a crash..except perhaps apport.log.1 which you may want to check
06:23	<bulmer>	xtknight: okay, i am looking for tips on how to access the guest os from another remote puter.
06:23	<kahrytan>	eternaljoy: I forget it's name. Don't use it often.
06:23	<chowmeined>	how do I edit already encoded video?
06:23	<konam>	someone could tell me howto get window border after the windows effects get enabled....
06:23	<memphis>	hello
06:23	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	Tarkus,  java...  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java
06:23	<HYPOCRISY>	confidential
06:23	<eternaljoy>	paradon: cheers
06:23	<cesar_>	the reason i had to edit my /etc/fstab is because i mounted /home to its own hard drive
06:24	<cesar_>	and when the device names changed my home directory disappeared
06:24	<filch>	heh
06:24	<filch>	that sucks
06:24	<Tarkus>	bulmer: only through add/remove so far. (im new to linux), i also found the .bin installer on java.com but the last time i tried installing with binary (realplayer) it wouldnt let me run the software, and i couldnt remove it properly, i had to just delete the folder i installed it to.
06:24	<xtknight>	bulmer, ahh different than shared folders?
06:24	<Lta1>	thunderbird help- how do I make thunderbird start up into the inbox, instead of the "what would you like to do" esque-screen with EMAIL, ACCOUNTS, and Adv. Features catagories? changing the option under edit-preferences-general didn't seem to change anything.
06:24	<Bhaskar1>	can i migrate ubuntu 6.06 to edubuntu , Any idea? now i have ubuntu 6.06
06:24	<xtknight>	bulmer, cuz shared folders is unidirectional AFAIK.  you can only write and read from within the guest OS
06:24	<memphis>	has anyone installed/compiled video drivers for Intel 965?
06:24	<xtknight>	bulmer, you can however enable SMB within the guest OS and have it work like any other networked windows PC (enable SMB in Windows firewall)
06:25	<bulmer>	xtknight: yeah, i wanted to run a server in the guest os and access it from a client (from a remote computer)
06:25	<se2131>	xtknight: the /var/crash directory only has a couple of files that were updated a couple of days ago
06:25	<peeps>	how can i check what graphics drivers are currently in use on my comptuer?
06:25	<se2131>	xtknight: and the apport log just shows some opera pluginwrapper crashes
06:25	<kahrytan>	eternaljoy:  There is one extention that uses templates.
06:25	<xtknight>	se2131, ah i suppose youll have to wait if/until it crashes again, unfortunately.  as for next time uhh i'm not sure :\..kinda per-case basis depending on how/what's crashing
06:25	<oldude67>	ok if i have the latest version of java loaded on to this machine why cant i run frostwire?
06:25	<eternaljoy>	kahrytan: which one?
06:26	<xtknight>	bulmer, you can always run VNC from within the guest OS too
06:26	<cesar_>	hlep /dev/null throws out everything that is sent to it!1!
06:26	<se2131>	xtknight: basically I'm having problems w/ fiesty crashing every 20-30 minutes
06:26	<xtknight>	se2131, oh :\
06:26	<GButler>	After I've installed Feisty on my laptop, after the log-in screen, the desktop hangs. It cuts out of the splash screen early and cuts the log-in sound off early as well. Then, it just leaves the desktop and blank menu bars (sometimes no menu bars at all!). I can't right click, and I don't understand what's going on at all. I can boot up in recovery mode (Which I'm doing now), and when I do...
06:26	<se2131>	xtknight: it worked fine w/ edgy
06:26	<GButler>	...that it tells me that there's an Internal Error and it cannnot initialize HAL...anyone have an idea of what's going on?
06:26	<bulmer>	Tarkus: for one, the .bin file you download have to be chmod u+x  then you need to run update-alternatives java
06:26	<paradon>	eternaljoy: apparently Pan doesn't have built in SSL support, but apparently you can use Stunnel to get the same effect.
06:26	<xtknight>	se2131, well post your "dmesg" just right now
06:26	<xtknight>	!pastebin
06:26	<acehigh>	good evening everyone

06:26	<se2131>	xtknight, dmesg?
06:26	<cesar_>	is feisty working fine for everyone? im afraid of trying it
06:26	<eternaljoy>	!Stunnel
06:26	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about stunnel - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
06:26	<xtknight>	se2131, type "dmesg" in the terminal.  then copy that to a pastebin and give me the link
06:26	<eternaljoy>	paradon: IS Stunnel an extension to Pan?
06:27	<acehigh>	cesar_: it seems to work fine for me except sound
06:27	<diabolix>	so.. i've seen people with a little text box on their gnome-panel that let them run a command... what is the name of that applet?
06:27	<kahrytan>	eternaljoy: http://sage.mozdev.org/
06:27	<xtknight>	cesar_, works the greatest of any distro here
06:27	<oldude67>	i have everything working for it....but i built a new system just for it.
06:27	<xtknight>	you can not determine how it will work on your PC from other peoples' PC experiences
06:27	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	What is the channel rate in here?  (ie, A person must answer a certain amount of questions to get his answered)
06:27	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i did dmesg and I have the output, but i'm not sure what you mean by pastebin (sorry for my ignorance)
06:27	<bulmer>	xtknight yes am able to access from the guest os to the outside world, it is the other way around i wanted to test...remote puter to guest os
06:27	<diabolix>	mini-command for gnome?

06:27	<ingo>	macbook/feisty out there?
06:28	<tabman>	can I extract .rar files under ubuntu ?
06:28	<fizz_>	anyone use amarok?
06:28	<paradon>	eternaljoy: No, stunnel is a separate program that runs locally... you make Pan connect to stunnel on localhost, and stunnel connects to the NNTP server using SSL.
06:28	<xtknight>	!unrar | tabman
06:28	<ubotu>	tabman: rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
06:28	<GButler>	...Did I just kill the chat...>	O.o'
06:28	<jrib>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: nope, basically, you ask a question and if someone knows the answer (and sees your question) you get help
06:28	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: only if we knew the answers :)
06:28	<AlexC>	i removed a video card and it's driver
06:28	<aimes>	tabman: sudo aptitude install unrar
06:28	<AlexC>	and gnomeisn
06:28	<thomaslai>	fizz_, I use amarok
06:28	<chainer827>	can anyone help me with this error message: E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_edgy_universe_binary-i386_Packages
06:28	<phixnay>	cesar and anyone else who wants to know about the hda to sda change - check out this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2500537#post2500537
06:28	<AlexC>	and gnome isn't working
06:28	<concept10>	xtknight, like you said, it must be disabled in the bios or something or needs to be recompiled ... it still didnt come up when I added that kopt (I used grub)
06:28	<xtknight>	bulmer, yeah you should be able to do that technically
06:29	<eternaljoy>	paradon>	eternaljoy: No, stunnel is a separate program that runs locally... you make Pan connect to stunnel on localhost, and stunnel connects to the NNTP server using SSL. <-- LOL!  Any ideas how I do this? :P
06:29	<fizz_>	thomaslai, any idea how to install codecs? just installed it in feisty and it wont play mp3s, when it asks if i want to install codecs it crashes
06:29	<xtknight>	bulmer, a remote PC should be able to see the guest OS if the windows firewall is disabled
06:29	<xtknight>	or configured..
06:29	<bulmer>	xtknight right, even from the host to the guest
06:29	<AlexC>	is the a non gui text editor installed on ubuntu?
06:29	<xtknight>	concept10, odd..
06:29	<xtknight>	AlexC, vim and nano
06:30	<bulmer>	AlexC yes..go to console and use vim
06:30	<oldude67>	now can anyone tell me why i cant get frostwire to work?
06:30	<concept10>	xtknight, alot of laptop manufacturers are stupid and they disable all types of stuff
06:30	<xtknight>	nano is better for most stuff, it's less frustrating imo
06:30	<weltschmerz>	did feisty do something weird with the keymaps?
06:30	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, so I guess I can take it that no one in here knows how to make the tty login work when it has continually rejected the user name and password.
06:30	<memphis>	can anyone direct me to compiling intel 965 vga driver?
06:30	<xtknight>	well less frustrating for n00bs
06:30	<weltschmerz>	what files now specify the standard keymaps?
06:30	<diabolix>	i geuss the debian guys are vi people?
06:30	<Tarkus>	bulmer: yea i did chmod and everyhting, and i executed the program and it said it installed succesfully (realplayer). but when i launched the software it couldnt locate "realplay" does not exist, or something. and i had to manually delete it by removing the folder i installed it to. i just dont want to have to do the same thing for java and find out that its screwed up again.
06:30	<compgood>	just out of curiosity, is any script put into /etc/init.d executed automatically on boot?
06:30	<NemesisD>	oh excellent
06:30	<bofh80>	eternaljoy, damn claws gtk2 is a nice fast email client with news support but it only has SSL support configured for SMTP or POP3 damn it, thought i was onto a winner :S
06:30	<se2131>	xtknight: sorry, computer crashed again, I'll get that link to you in a sec
06:30	<compgood>	or is there something more that must be done for one to execute?
06:30	<NemesisD>	not only did my upgrade fail but it completely busted ubuntu

06:30	<NemesisD>	this is awesome
06:30	<xtknight>	concept10, ah HT would seem to be one of those things they'd brag about though (omg it has HT, dual core, pmg etc)
06:30	<jrib>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: can you get to recovery mode?
06:30	<xtknight>	HT is almost always a default on afaik

06:31	<jrib>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: it only fails when you go to a tty? ie gui works?
06:31	<rpaul>	using xchat-gnome
06:31	<bulmer>	Tarkus it must have been your install process that failed..java is pretty straightforward install

06:31	<ubotu>	konam: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
06:32	<concept10>	xtknight, I know HP was disabling the new Intel virtulization features on the laptop motherboard somehow because alot of people complained about not being able to use those features
06:32	<toastjam>	hey, so is there anyway to get the kernel make install process to create the necessary initrd image as well?
06:32	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, I get the login but it doesn't recognise my password
06:32	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: it is installed, you just have to make rules. look into fwbuilder
06:32	<paradon>	eternaljoy: According to google, yes.  Really, stunnel should work with pretty much anything.
06:32	<bulmer>	xtknight: yes the host can access the guest and vice versa
06:32	<se2131>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16967/
06:32	<xtknight>	concept10, ah i heard about dell doing that too
06:32	<xtknight>	concept10, lenovo rather
06:32	<Shaddox>	lordhelmet: I'll google it. ^^
06:32	<wil_syd>	rpaul: is that a ghost of you ? Wait till it times out.
06:32	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: it gives you a nice gui for creating a firewall script
06:32	<konam>	ubotu i already do it: could you tell me howto get window border after the windows effects get enabled....?
06:32	<eternaljoy>	paradon: so I install Pan and Stunnel.  Then what I do?
06:32	<jrib>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: reboot and choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu.  then do 'passwd USERNAME' to set a new password.  See if that resolves things
06:32	<toastjam>	everything I read online says making and installing the kernel creates initrd, but as far as I can tell it doesn't, and my system won't boot without it
06:32	<bofh80>	eternaljoy, http://mahogany.sourceforge.net/features.html   how's about that?
06:32	<Shaddox>	lordhelmet: Does it support being used on this machine over SSH?
06:32	<xtknight>	bulmer, weird.  so other PCs on the host's LAN /can't/ access the guest..
06:33	<rpaul>	wil_syd: i registered a few months ago.  so it isn't a ghost, I just don't seem to be able to identify myself correctly
06:33	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: take a look at securetty  /etc/securetty
06:33	<xtknight>	se2131, pastebin "sudo lshw" also
06:33	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: probably with xforwarding, but they have windows clients as well so you can create your script anywhere and just scp it over or something
06:33	<concept10>	xtknight, I just found this: To achieve the maximum gain from Hyper-Threading requires the 2.6 kernel compiled with the "-march=pentium4" option. This is accomplished by setting the processor to "pentium4" in the kernel configuration menu. It looks like Hyper-Threading on the Pentium4 with Linux is fact after all.
06:33	<bulmer>	xtknight: yes because the guest is usually on a different subnet
06:33	<paradon>	eternaljoy: configure stunnel to connect to your NNTPS server, and configure Pan with stunnel as it's NNTP server.
06:33	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	jrib, cool, thanks............. bulmer I will, thanks
06:33	<concept10>	xtknight, but I have HT tired head now :)
06:33	<xtknight>	concept10, yeah its not worth all that anyway
06:33	<lordhelmet>	Shaddox: actually yes you can xforward...i have done it
06:33	<wil_syd>	rpaul:  if it puts an underscore it means the name is in use
06:33	<memphis>	which command  for checking version of kernel?
06:34	<xtknight>	concept10, as you said HD is give and take
06:34	<xtknight>	HT*
06:34	<xtknight>	sometimes increases sometimes decreases
06:34	<lordhelmet>	does anybody else have problems installing 64bit?? mine fails all the time at 85% trying to get translation stuff

06:34	<xtknight>	bulmer, ahh i see
06:34	<mlocker>	Hi

06:36	<xtknight>	bulmer, oh not sure.  iptables is disabled by default (or the rules set is blank) so that wouldn't be the problem with what you were describing

06:38	<xtknight>	bulmer, i'm afraid that kind of networking is over my head
06:38	<se2131>	xtknight: it's just weird, b/c both edgy and windows work fine, but both fiesty beta and the fiesty release have this same problem
06:38	<xtknight>	se2131, ah hmm
06:38	<xtknight>	se2131, kernel regression perhaps

06:41	<Madpilot>	ubotu, java | neilthereildeil
06:41	<neilthereildeil>	and installed a different jvm
06:41	<ubotu>	neilthereildeil: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
06:41	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: thats close enuff for testing, you can attempt to change a users password by opening an xconsole
06:41	<xtknight>	se2131, i see weird stuff like this though "ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNK1]  (IRQs 10 11) *0, disabled."

06:41	<neilthereildeil>	Madpilot: i already have it installed
06:41	<stroppytux>	what help do you need with kdevelop?
06:41	<weltschmerz>	what files does feisty use to define keymaps?
06:41	<neilthereildeil>	i need to integrate it with firefox
06:41	<xtknight>	se2131, as seen in your dmesg "PCI: If a device doesn't work, try "pci=routeirq".  If it helps, post a report"  << good advice.
06:41	<bulmer>	MrBarkyVonShnauz: and as root, type  sudo passwd username   where username is the user you want to change its password
06:41	<Madpilot>	neilthereildeil, see the URL the bot just gave you, it's got the browser info too
06:42	<Shaezsche>	what does the "dbe" module in xorg do? what is double buffering

06:42	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	bulmer, cool, I remember having to do that once about 5 months ago now.
06:43	<Col_Delta>	can always add KDE Skipzorz
06:43	<weltschmerz>	n2diy what files define the keymaps?  my xkb keymap for Esperanto is no longer working.
06:43	<Tarkus>	bulmer: when i installed realplayer, since it didnt work, is it a bad thing to install it again? or should i remove every trace of it first and then install? or does it matter at all?
06:43	<blazemonger>	if i can't find a piece of midi sequencing software that i can use with   my midi gear then i'm smashing this laptop AND the pc
06:43	<Skipzorz>	thanks col
06:43	<Madpilot>	Skipzorz, no, it isn't. Servers don't need a UI - it's just one more thing to get attacked if it's on the web
06:43	<Skipzorz>	ah
06:43	<Skipzorz>	well that makes sense now that I think about it
06:43	<se2131>	xtknight: sorry, crashed again
06:43	<xtknight>	se2132, i dont meant to scare you, but.  http://www.notebookforums.com/thread51325.html
06:43	<bulmer>	Tarkus: i do not know about real player ..you may not need to remove all the traces..btw there are no hidden Registries in linux like in windows to hide stuff
06:43	<Skipzorz>	thanks madpilot
06:44	<MrTexor>	:(
06:44	<obble>	stroppytux: i've tried right clicking over the src files to see if theres an add source file or something like that. but there isnt
06:44	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: check out " man loadkeys" and "system -prefrences-keyboard"
06:44	<xtknight>	se2131, suppoesdly that laptop is notorious for freezing
06:44	<xjkx>	Please check what mp3 player came by default :(
06:44	<thebillywayne>	my motherboard came with a disc with Linux shell scripts on it.  Should I run these?
06:44	<MrTexor>	ok, I'm stupid.. but I cant find the llink for the torrent file :(
06:44	<xtknight>	se2131, again though if it doesn't happen on Edgy or windows/etc... then you can ignore that as that can't be the problem
06:44	<Madpilot>	Skipzorz, that said, you can run Apache/etc on a standard install too - useful if you want a testing/dev server that isn't exposed to the public
06:44	<bulmer>	thebillywayne: why not see whats in it before running the script?
=== kerframil is now known as kerframil_
06:45	<obble>	Alright anyone else know how to fix my Kdevelop problem: I'm just trying to add already made source files to a project. But I cant manage to do it.
06:45	<se2131>	xtknight: oh man, so maybe i should talk to toshiba
06:45	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: I would never run a script without looking it over first.
06:45	<se2131>	xtknight: I should also clarify the type of crash i'm having
06:45	<xtknight>	se2131, why dont you just try Edgy for the night , like right now, and see if it hapepns
06:45	<Zues_62>	does anyone know of a lit file reader for ubuntu?
06:45	<xtknight>	se2131, hmm yeah what do you mean by crash then?

=== rancorr is now known as Valtek
06:45	<Skipzorz>	well, I already have an apache server set up on windows, and am converting it to ubuntu server
06:45	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, bulmer, looking at it, though I'm not sure what I'm looking at.
06:45	<Shaezsche>	what does the "dbe" module in xorg do? what is double buffering
06:45	<root__>	how do you scroll up bash?
06:45	<se2131>	xtknight: the mouse is still responsive
06:45	<Shaezsche>	if i want more fps should i load it or not
06:45	<Skipzorz>	windows is attacked to much
06:45	<xtknight>	se2131, oh..
06:45	<Tarkus>	bulmer: so, in linux when it installs, it only puts stuff in the directory i specified? or does it still scatter stuff arround in the system that will take many hours to find them?
06:45	<se2131>	xtknight: but I can't do anything with the applciations
06:45	<Madpilot>	MrTexor, look for the .torrent files at the same places you download the rest of the Ubuntu ISOs
06:45	<obble>	Can someone pretty please help me with a Kdevelop issue?
06:46	<bofh80>	Madpilot, why is it the linux community say server and they mean 'web' server, why is that? not File server or Backup Server or Application server, like business wise, why is that? lol it drives me potty :P
06:46	<ardchoille>	thebillywayne: Yeah, that can be a drawback. I wold recommend learning bash scripting at some point.
06:46	<xtknight>	se2131, it could be I/O overload, perhaps from updatedb trying to update the search database.
06:46	<se2131>	xtknight: i can't do ctrl-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-del, or ctrl-alt-f1
06:46	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i know where the keyboard preferences are.  i'm talking about the XKB file where you define the keymaps.
06:46	<xtknight>	se2131, try alt SysRq K next time
06:46	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, what does that do?
06:46	<thebillywayne>	ardchoille, yeah.  that's it.
06:46	<xtknight>	se2131, kills all open apps, it's a last resort/kernel debug
06:46	<lordhelmet>	gah why does this install fail all the time?? stupid translation files...
06:46	<NemesisD>	can you guys help me fix ubuntu? attempting to upgrade seems to have just about destroyed my ubuntu partition
06:46	<peeps>	anyone know what "dos2unix" is?  i think i need this program
06:46	<root__>	how do you scroll bash?
06:46	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	thanks bulmer,
06:46	<weltschmerz>	n2diy for instance:     key <AE06>	{ [          6,  asciicircum, dead_circumflex, dead_circumflex ]  };
06:46	<Madpilot>	bofh80, not sure - because most of the time when people say 'server' they mean 'web server', probably. People who want advice on a file server will generally be more specific than just 'server'
06:47	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
06:47	<xtknight>	se2131, if your mouse moves, alt sysrq K will unfreeze your PC.  not that you shold be using that regularly.  in fact you should never use it ideally but it's not like it's harmful
06:47	<bulmer>	Tarkus it puts stuff in what is considered normal directories like /etc for the configs  or /usr/local/ ..read the package you are installing and find out as much..but for java its not that awkward
06:47	<bofh80>	Madpilot, ahh i see, that makes sense, LOL.
06:47	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: roger, then check out the man page for loadkeys
06:47	<se2131>	xtknight: i guess anything in a pinch
06:47	<Moosejaw>	is it possible that feisty is effecting my wireless NICS range with my router?
06:47	<Skipzorz>	is LAMP the best way to go for servers?
06:47	<zak_>	peeps: changes DOS text format into a unix text format [fixes newline glitches...]  it can be done with standard commands though, someone should be able to fill you in
06:47	<xtknight>	se2131, but if the mouse is moving that means your kernel is still running
06:47	<bofh80>	Madpilot, thanks for clearing that up, another n00b problem.  heheheheheh
06:47	<xtknight>	se2131, meaning you could alt sysrq K , goto a virtual terminal, and check dmesg or save it to a file and post it
06:47	<bulmer>	Skipzorz: what do you want to serve?
06:47	<se2131>	xtknight: is there a way to limit the rate of  I/O
06:48	<xtknight>	se2131, almost /certainly/ dmesg will have useful info in it
06:48	<oldude67>	trying to get frostwire to run but keeps coming up with no java installed and have the newest when i type in the command to apt-get
06:48	<Skipzorz>	simple website
06:48	<GButler>	Does any one here know why, on a laptop, I'd get an Internal Error that says Ubuntu cannot initialize the HAL when I boot up in recovery mode, and when I try to boot into the normal mode it just hangs, cuts the splash screen off and just loads a wallpaper?
06:48	<Tarkus>	bulmer: java is installing now though add/remove. it started working. is that a good way to do it?
06:48	<xtknight>	se2131, not that i know of.
06:48	<se2131>	xtknight: ok, i'll try that next time
06:48	<peeps>	zak_, do you know what package i need to install?  I need to compile something from source and the makefile is failing because of this

06:52	<Skipzorz>	anyone know how to portforward through a router and an IP phone for apache server?
06:52	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: effecting? can you elaborate the specific problem ?
06:52	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: Sorry, I don't have a clue. I am running Dvorak now, on Dapper. Good luck.
06:52	<bofh80>	sam__, you can use ftp to access all the files on your system . . .
06:52	<weltschmerz>	the xkb system is just chaos.
06:52	<Death_Sargent>	gnome and kde won't work
06:52	<weltschmerz>	n2diy i fixed it using my own advice, using a much older xkb file.
06:52	<nny>	.join #ubunut-effects
06:52	<Moosejaw>	making it have less range...in comparison to how it was working in feisty.  thus slowing download speeds
06:52	<Death_Sargent>	I just installed fsce and it works
06:52	<sam__>	how do i isntall ftp acess???
06:52	<thebillywayne>	what flash drive brands does Feisty play well with?  anyone have one that works nice and clean out of the box?
06:52	<sam__>	does it come standard
06:52	<weltschmerz>	i don't know why X has such an insane system for defining keyboard layouts, that is so incredibly poorly documented.
06:52	<Moosejaw>	distance from the router is a problem now
06:53	<n2diy>	weltschmerz: Good, what was the fix?
06:53	<orangefly>	anyone else have trouble with a built in broadcom wireless card and feisty....???....
06:53	<JackPhil>	Hi, it seems apache2 can't stop, and I couldnt upgrade to feisty

06:53	<Tarkus>	Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode)
06:53	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: may i suggest you prefix your responses with a nick so it would not be missed
06:53	<bofh80>	sam__, one way to find out :) i believe so, but i might be wrong
06:53	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: sorry
06:53	<oldude67>	oh so im not the only one having trouble with java
06:53	<bulmer>	Tarkus: congrats..you have java jre installed
06:54	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: making it have less range...in comparison to how it was working in feisty.  thus slowing download speeds
06:54	<CarlFK>	how do I add a tty to the serial port so I can connect to a shell from a 2nd box via minicom?
06:54	<paradon>	sam__: For FTP access, you need to apt-get install vsftpd
06:54	<Phineas>	What's up folks
06:54	<Tarkus>	bulmer: nice
06:54	<paradon>	sam__: and you'll want to edit /etc/vsftpd.conf, by default it only has anonymous access enabled.
06:54	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: im still not sure i comprehend "less range" as in your nic is not able to listen to an AP ?
=== kerframil_ is now known as kerframil
06:55	<scotty_>	Alright, I have a question regarding feisty install.
06:55	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: the signal strength isnt as strong as it was
06:55	<sanityx>	I had to reinstall windows after I installed ubuntu. To resture grub I can just boot off the feisty cd right
06:55	<xtknight>	Moosejaw,  it's possible the driver is more picky about the wireless range somehow.  usually that's a wireless/RF chipset tolerance not a driver one though who knows.
06:55	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: ttySX is a serial port
06:55	<sanityx>	whats the command again, grub-install?
06:56	<Moosejaw>	xtknight thanks
06:56	<CarlFK>	n2diy: where do I put that?
06:56	<xtknight>	why does nothing tab complete when i prefix it with sudo?
06:56	<dfg>	!restricted
06:56	<scotty_>	I booted from a disk, went through the installation process, and now there's just a taskbar item that says "installing system". When I click it, it brings up a little window with a gray square on it.
06:56	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
06:56	<scotty_>	Is that normal?
06:56	<diabolix>	anyone here use deskbar?
06:56	<xtknight>	no commands tabcomplete but filenames do when using 'sudo'
06:56	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: maybe the drivers used are not using the same capabilities..besides anything wireless is not guaranteed to work 100%
06:56	<|ringo|>	sanityx: next time you install windows after linux, do this before installing windows: dd if=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1 >	/tmp/backup/MBR.bin
06:56	<Shaba1>	I have no dies what it is diabolix
06:56	<|ringo|>	that backs up the master book record, so you can restore it after windows deletes it
06:56	<sanityx>	heh ok
06:56	<oldude67>	why is it i cant get frostwire to see the new java installed?
=== eddy is now known as copehn
06:57	<sanityx>	|ringo|: yeah but then the mbr wont have a windows listing
06:57	<Shaba1>	But am interested in findign out
06:57	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: it was working great in edgy with the same drivers...so i sorta expected the same in feisty
06:57	<diabolix>	xtknight, thats because bash searches you're path for the command to run, but only searches the working directory for arguments.
06:57	<|ringo|>	sanityx: right but then you run uh...  grub-install and it will find windows and add it to the grub list
06:57	<bofh80>	xtknight, works for me
06:57	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Just set both boxes up to us the same ttySX, baud rates, etc... It is a simple serial port connection.
06:57	<sanityx>	|ringo|: ah ok
06:57	<diabolix>	i seem to remember that working in edgy tho...
06:58	<xtknight>	diabolix, ah hmm.  bash does have some features i'd deem far more advanced such as argument tab completing so i wondered
06:58	<xtknight>	bofh80, interesting
06:58	<CarlFK>	n2diy: but just because I can talk to the port doesn't mean it will give me a login prompt
06:58	<xtknight>	bofh80, you can type sudo grub-i and it will say grub-install?
06:58	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: again, umm nothing is guaranteed..and how do you really measure this percieved slowness?
06:58	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ah, I see. Look into ssh
06:58	<bofh80>	xtknight, yup, works...
06:58	<xtknight>	well for reasons i cant possibly conceive my bash /gnome terminal has been messed from the start on this instlal of Feisty
06:58	<KevinOoO>	anyone know how to add transparency to a panel background???
06:58	<xtknight>	so who knows
06:58	<diabolix>	so.. does anyone know how to make the deskbar only search google? it asks for amazon and all this stuff i don't care about.
06:58	<xtknight>	diabolix, it's in the preferences isnt it..
06:58	<CarlFK>	n2diy: you have no clue, do you ? :)
06:59	<scotty_>	I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the "install" button at the end of the process. Now there's just an item in my taskbar called "Installing system." When clicked, it brings a window to focus. However, the window is tiny and just has a little gray box in it. Is that normal?
06:59	<diabolix>	xtknight, it is, but it doesn't do anything.
=== kerframil is now known as kerframil_
06:59	<Skiguy>	anyone running azureus on 7.04?
06:59	<bofh80>	xtknight, log on a TTY as root and see if it autocompletes commands as root ?
06:59	<SpeakerMania>	Quick question: If I have a high speed connection, can I plug the network cable inot my computer and have instant internet access? Or do I have to configure stuff? I have 6.10.
06:59	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Umm, I guess not, I have two boxes networked, talking to each other etc...
06:59	<xtknight>	i prefer gnome-bt-download (simplistic bittorrent)
06:59	<peeps>	how can i verify which graphics driver is running?
06:59	<xtknight>	though a bit limited/terse
07:00	<KevinOoO>	anyone know how to add transparency to a panel background???
07:00	<Skiguy>	Speaker: should be immediate, assuming your card is recognized. almost all are.
07:00	<SpeakerMania>	Alright, thanks.
07:00	<n2diy>	Car'FK: Umm, I guess not, I have two boxes networked, talking to each other etc...
07:00	<xtknight>	bofh80, yea it works under "sudo i" # shell
07:00	<bofh80>	xtknight, i ended up using that, cos all the other bittorrent clients for linux are , well, cough . . . .
07:00	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: Right click it
07:00	<Andruk>	xtknight: i am simply trying to get gnome to start metacity (or any window manager) when i log in.
07:00	<ozymandias>	anyone have a guide on getting compiz-kde working?
07:00	<CarlFK>	n2diy: I got networking too.  trying to make one a bridge, and getting tired of loosing my ssh connection.  figured a serial connection would survive all my network restarts that dont start
07:00	<bulmer>	xtknight: try tput reset  and see if it resets to some default working terminal
07:00	<scotty_>	anyone?
07:00	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: Under background, you can set the opacity
07:01	<xtknight>	Andruk, but what has happened up until this point?  metacity should be starting
=== scotty_ is now known as scott1
07:01	<xtknight>	Andruk, gnome should 'just work' (tm)
07:01	<Andruk>	i upgraded to feisty...
07:01	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, i know how to do that, but im using a theme, which has a bckground
07:01	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, if you use a backround you cant set opacity, theres another way
07:02	<xtknight>	bulmer, it cleared my screen basically
07:02	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, then your right, I don't have a clue! :) Are the other boxes playing with winders?
07:02	<xtknight>	bulmer, hrm what does that do?
07:02	<liquiddoom>	KevinOoO: I have mine set to white with the opacity at around 30%
07:02	<xtknight>	bulmer, different than "clear"?
07:02	<Andruk>	xtknight: well, i can start metacity from the terminal, and when i hit ctrl+c it exits, then automatically restarts metacity.  but if i just log in and leave gnome alone, metacity does not load
07:02	<CarlFK>	n2diy: well, I have samba and some win boxes too
07:02	<bofh80>	hmm, i don't get it, how come no one is raving about their cool 3d desktops ? ;p
07:02	<bulmer>	xtknight: tput is basically for terminal setting
07:02	<xtknight>	Andruk, weird.  hmm look in ~/.xinitrc maybe
07:03	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, I only am playing with Ubuntu to Ubuntu.
07:03	<bulmer>	xtknight: it has options i cant remember though
07:03	<Ademan>	how might one import emails from a previous installation of ubuntu into a new one? (evolution)
07:03	<xtknight>	Ademan, maybe access the ~/.evolution folder of the old ubuntu
07:03	<xtknight>	Ademan, i thought feisty's installer also had profile importing you could do
07:03	<Ademan>	xtknight: it very well may
07:03	<eoX>	Hi is it true that if i install linux first then windows will not install b/c it will not recongnize the linux partitions?
07:03	<CarlFK>	n2diy: thats all I am trying to do right now.   login from ubuntu1 to u2 via the serial cable and null modem
07:04	<xtknight>	Ademan, only in the livecd installer though not Alternate or Update-manager->feisty
07:04	<bofh80>	Ademan, if you know where the data is, surely evolution has it's own import process?
07:04	<xtknight>	Ademan, not 100% sure so backup ~/.evolution or export from within the app?
07:04	<Gumby>	eoX: you cant install windows on a linux partition.
07:04	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: Ok, so what is wrong with ssh then?
07:04	<scott1>	I'm installing Ubuntu Feisty right now. I went through the process, and clicked the "install" button at the end of the process. Now there's just an item in my taskbar called "Installing system." When clicked, it brings a window to focus. However, the window is tiny and just has a little gray box in it. Is that normal?
07:04	<Ademan>	eoX: no windows will install, but it will overwrite GRUB and you'll hafta do extra work to get to your linux partition, linux will autodetect your windows partition and everything will be easier
07:04	<xtknight>	actually sometimes windows wont even install
07:04	<xtknight>	because it's so picky
07:04	<bulmer>	CarlFK: is the a getty process running on those serial ports?
07:04	<KevinOoO>	liquiddoom, look at this preview http://gnomelook.org/content/preview.php?preview=1&id=53883&file1=53883-1.jpg&file2=&file3=&name=Fedora+Gnome+Vista+Panel
07:05	<Ademan>	xtknight: well i'm backing up my entire home directory so you know, whatever, hopefully it will work
07:05	<xtknight>	itll say unrecognized boot partition because GRUB is there
07:05	<CarlFK>	n2diy: ssh goes over ip -
07:05	<xtknight>	and wont install
07:05	<xtknight>	ive had that :(
07:05	<bofh80>	Ademan, i looked at the evolution import option, bit lacking isn't it lol
07:05	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: i think i have things working better now...thanks for your help.
07:05	<CarlFK>	bulmer: du no.  the one I am trying to connect 'to' is running a fresh feisty
07:05	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: no problem, sometimes pointing out that there are no guarantees, people realize some stuff are acceptable afterall
07:06	<Ademan>	bofh80: haha, yeah, i guess i'll just keep .evolution around in case i ever need to find an old email, and other than that, i'll just start fresh
07:06	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: on a separate note, my upload speed is now equivalent to my download speed...which makes no sense.  how can i improve my download speed?
07:06	<n2diy>	Car'lFK: OK! Now who doesn't have a clue?! IP is serial comms!
07:06	<eoX>	ademan for me i did windows install and its ok but when i installed linux first then windows will hang at examining hardwares and give a black screen before even going into the blue agreement screen
07:06	<Moosejaw>	my upspeed is 1301/kbs and my dload is 1000/lbs
07:06	<Moosejaw>	kbs
07:06	<bofh80>	Ademan, i had high hopes for evolution, it has a few nice tricks up it sleeve, but it's pants :)
07:06	<Ademan>	eoX: interesting, i personally have done both, and both worked, just windows second took a lot more work
07:06	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
07:07	<axisys>	does ubuntu works with cisco leap?
07:07	<Ademan>	lol bofh80
07:07	<tankcat>	i just order a machine with an amd64 dualcore cpu for $310 :-)
07:07	<Andruk>	xtknight: i dont have an ~/.xinitrc (and yes, i am looking at hidden files).  i do have an ~/.xsession-errors though, would you like to see that?
07:07	<CarlFK>	n2diy: yean, but first I would have to bring up a ip over serial connection, which would get screwed the same way my eth0 connection is getting screwed
07:07	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: the site your downloading from have to be capable of doing same too or higher speed than yours..lots of factors..isp maybe have you throttled
07:07	<renato>	everyone happy with Feisty?
07:07	<xtknight>	Andruk, sure that may be helpful
07:07	<liz>	yes yes :)
07:07	<eoX>	ademan did you use mkfs.vfat and fdisk to make a parition first in linux? or use gpart to parition the empty space first before you install windows to it?
07:07	<xtknight>	Ademan, http://email.about.com/cs/evolutiontips/qt/et110103.htm
07:07	<Moosejaw>	hrm...my dload speed should be 6000kbs...just unusual
07:07	<Phineas>	renato, it's fantastic. Brought me back from the darkside
07:07	<liquiddoom>	Feisty rocks. I have a couple errors every now and then, but oh well.

07:08	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok so you are having other problems too?
07:08	<CarlFK>	bulmer: getty's used to be setup in /etc/initab, but that went away a few versions ago
07:08	<tom_>	xtknight, do you know how to help me... I have gone through all that before and had to reinstall feisty 4 times
07:08	<_3uG_>	quick question.. what's the difference between linux-image-###-386 and linux-image-###-generic?
07:08	<blanky>	hey guys on feisty, how do you do the  character, compose key + what?
07:08	<liz>	tom: whats not working right?
07:09	<Ademan>	eoX: i used the partitioner included with the ubuntu installer, which at the time was gparted
07:09	<bulmer>	CarlFK: on a dapper am using now, its still is enabled
07:09	<xtknight>	tom_, what video adapter do you have?
07:09	<Moosejaw>	bulmer: just using a cable line and modem
07:09	<tom_>	liz, I have not been able to get a resolution that looks right on my screen
07:09	<tom_>	xtknight, video adapter?
07:09	<xtknight>	tom_, i wont say i WILL be able to fix your resolution problem but i very likely will be able to
07:09	<tom_>	xtknight, you mean my video card?
07:09	<CarlFK>	bulmer: huh - maybe Ill just give it a shot :)
07:09	<xtknight>	tom_, yes or onboard video chip, whichever applies
07:09	<eoX>	ademan yeah i did the same but windows installer hangs with linux present its not a big deal i just wanted to know so thanks
07:09	<bulmer>	Moosejaw: you can not really complain of not getting same speed upload or download unless your ISP guarantees it..which most likely they wont
07:09	<liz>	tom: define looks right, what does it look like
07:09	<axisys>	!leap
07:09	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about leap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

07:11	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thanks
07:11	<liz>	tom: kk yor using an nvidia 6600 have you downloaded the drivers yets from nvidia (the stock open source nv driver constantly freezes on me)_
07:11	<tom_>	xtknight, I installed the restricted drivers from the option
07:11	<xtknight>	yeah stock nv is awful
07:11	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, i dont see that under preferences anymore in feisty..
07:11	<blanky>	!ati

07:11	<xtknight>	tom_, ah okay.  type "glxinfo | grep rendering" to verify that they are being used
07:12	<ardchoille>	I was a bit aprehensive of leaving Dapper for Feisty since Dapper has been super stable, but Feisty has proven very nice thus far. The Ubuntu devs did a good job on Feisty.
07:12	<kkathman>	could someone help me regarding problems with sound?  For some reason, the system seems to be trying to use the onboard instead of my SB live, even when I have it set properly

=== sunni is now known as sunn
07:12	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: Nor do I. Odd.
07:12	<Moosejaw>	liquiddoom: thats what i have used, and need to change my MTU according to the tweak tester
07:12	<tom_>	xtknight, it said yes
07:12	<xtknight>	tom_, also "lsmod | grep nvidia" to verify that the 'nvidia' driver is loaded.  if 'nvidia' is shown you're fine.
07:12	<tom_>	liz_,  i don't know
07:12	<liquiddoom>	Moosejaw: Ah. I only know how to change my WRT54G running DD-WRT
07:12	<Cobain>	liquiddoom, did that run something i could run in a term?
07:13	<_3uG_>	i'm trying to get my nvidia drivers to work too, but the restricted drivers manager installs the old 7xxx kernel driver and the newer 9xxx glx file.. which doesn't make sense.
07:13	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: I don't know, I'll check
07:13	<tom_>	xtknight, nvidia was shown
07:13	<blanky>	guys how do we install ati drivers, in the ati wiki page it just shows instructions for edgy and dapper, do we use edgy instructions?
07:13	<xtknight>	tom_, type "sudo nvidia-settings".  look at the settings in there.  you should be able to change your resolution.
07:13	<Phineas>	blanky: what ati card are you using?
07:13	<bofh80>	xtknight, should he be using nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new ? i think the latter? will the restricted manager have installed the correct one?
07:13	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800, no, I don't want the open source drivers
07:13	<RushCreek>	Hey, my roomate changed my root password, i cant get into init 1 to change it, is there anyway to resolve this?
07:13	<xtknight>	bofh80, restricted seems to always install -glx i think.  im not sure honesly
07:13	<blanky>	Phineas, 9800 pro
07:13	<xtknight>	bofh80, good point though
07:13	<ardchoille>	xtknight: Shouldn't that be gksudo nvidia-settings?
07:13	<blanky>	Phineas, ??
07:14	<RushCreek>	use the readon driver blanky it works with AIGLX
07:14	<tom_>	xtknight, you are a god
07:14	<tom_>	w00t
07:14	<xtknight>	ardchoille, perhaps im not sure
07:14	<blanky>	RushCreek, yeah thanks but how do you install it
07:14	<bofh80>	lol
07:14	<xtknight>	tom_, if the resolution succeeds you press the button that says "save to X configuration"
07:14	<ardchoille>	!gksudo
07:14	<ubotu>	If you need to run graphical applications as root, use  gksudo , as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using  sudo <GUI-application>	
07:14	<tom_>	xtknight, 9 damn hours of work and you fixed it in 2 seconds
07:14	<blanky>	wait though the radeon driver is the open source one isn't it
07:14	<RushCreek>	blanky:  what version of ubuntu? it comes with edgy for a fact, and probobly the rls before
07:14	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yes but what about apps that may be wrappers for gtk apps?
07:14	<CarlFK>	n2diy: trying to get LinuxBox1 to work, and I can't ping NewBox1 when I give it a static IP http://dev.personnelware.com/carl/a/batcave1.png
07:14	<blanky>	RushCreek, feisty
07:14	<liquiddoom>	Cobain: Removable Drives and Media
07:14	<bofh80>	xtknight, i didn't know i could do that :D
07:14	<RushCreek>	blanky:  just edit your xorg.conf to "radeon" for driver
07:14	<RushCreek>	and restart ex
07:14	<Cobain>	ahh thanks man
07:14	<axisys>	is there a wifi chnl for ubuntu?
07:14	<blanky>	RushCreek, no I want the proprietary drivers not the open source ones...nevermind
07:15	<RushCreek>	fglrx ?
07:15	<tom_>	xtknight, will I have any problems if I install beryl?
07:15	<ardchoille>	xtknight: I'm not sure there.
07:15	<RushCreek>	you can install thoes via apt banky
07:15	<xtknight>	ardchoille, yeah gksu would be used for nvidia-settings
07:15	<RushCreek>	apt-get install fglrx-module or some such biz
07:15	<xtknight>	ardchoille, what does 'gksu' even do differently anyways?
07:15	<xtknight>	i genreally use it reliously instead of sudo
07:15	<n2diy>	CarlFK: That isn't a static IP, and IP should look like 123.345.567.999
07:15	<crdlb>	blanky, did you try the restricted manager?
07:15	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use gksudo for GTK apps
07:15	<xtknight>	tom_, i dont think so
07:15	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Use sudo sometimes doesn't work right with them
07:16	<RushCreek>	so anyone have any ideas on resetting a root password on a local machine?
07:16	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: Err.
07:16	<Phineas>	Hey guys, how do I set a keystroke to launch the terminal?
07:16	<blanky>	crdlb, thanks, I'm new to feisty, where is that? system >	administration?
07:16	<xtknight>	liquiddoom, yeah i know.  i'd like as many details as possible as to the differences between gksu and sudo
07:16	<ardchoille>	xtknight: It sets up the environment better than sudo does.
07:16	<crdlb>	blanky, yes
07:16	<blanky>	crdlb, yeah it's there, thanks!
07:16	<xtknight>	ah
07:16	<CarlFK>	n2diy: what "that" isn't a static IP?
07:16	<blanky>	it comes up woo!
07:16	<liquiddoom>	xtknight: I honestly don't know
07:16	<Doughy>	anyone have time to help me with a gnome login prob?
07:16	<xtknight>	tom_, did you save the config to X11/xorg.conf?
07:16	<xtknight>	tom_, there is a button in nvidia-settings you must press after appyling the resolution
07:16	<blanky>	man feisty is a huge milestone in desktop linux
07:16	<tom_>	xtknight, .... one problem in the terminal when I clicked save to X configuration file it gave me an Error: FAiled to generate an X config file!
07:17	<Phineas>	Doughy, what's the problem?
07:17	<xtknight>	tom_, did you run nvidia-settings with "sudo" (well it should be "gksudo")
07:17	<n2diy>	CarlFK: IP addresses are numerical.
07:17	<Doughy>	My graphics go haywire when I "re-login"
07:17	<frutax>	I'm having trouble with my resolution, and I've tried several methods of installing the nvidia drivers, but every single method results in a blue xorg screen. There seems to be know what to fix my resolution, install any version of the nvidia driver, or install berly
07:17	<Doughy>	like if I was already logged in and try to return to my session
07:17	<xtknight>	wow how many people with resolution issues?
07:17	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to install realplayer? iv tried installing the .bin and it never works, im pretty sure i am installing it correctly also.
07:17	<xtknight>	Feisty should read the EDID
07:17	<Doughy>	I think it has something to do with beryl or the compiz features in ubuntu 7.04, but not sure
07:18	<xtknight>	but i heard we will have to wait until Xorg 7.3 for that :\
07:18	<tom_>	xtknight, yes I tried both sudo and gksudo neither allowed me to save the xfile
07:18	<Phineas>	Doughy, did you install beryl?
07:18	<Doughy>	I installed, then uninstalled beryl
07:18	<Doughy>	yes
07:18	<CarlFK>	n2diy: um... yes.  why are you telling me this?
07:18	<xtknight>	tom_, well let's just add it manually.  type "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
07:18	<Phineas>	did you rerun the xorg config?
07:18	<bofh80>	xtknight, cos of the rush redevelopment when nvidia rehashed the drivers just prior to release day lol
07:18	<Doughy>	no how do i do that?
07:18	<Phineas>	lemme find the command
07:18	<Doughy>	thanks man
07:18	<RushCreek>	nisgers.
07:19	<darkram>	I had a problem with resolution as well with my first install of 7.04, after reinstalling everything is working like a charm now.
07:19	<tom_>	ok
07:19	<liquiddoom>	dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xorg-something, right?
07:19	<bullgard4>	Using ysm I could send a message to my friend but could not receive one. What prerequisite did I not meet?
07:19	<NemesisD>	can someone help, i've got no wifi connectivity but the network manager can detect the router and acts like it's connected
07:19	<tom_>	xtknight, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16973/ if your interested in the error message
07:19	<xtknight>	liquiddoom, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
07:19	<Phineas>	Doughy, try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
07:19	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Because you sent this:  trying to get LinuxBox1 to work, and I can't ping NewBox1 when I give it a static IP http://dev.personnelware.com/carl/a/batcave1.png
07:19	<liquiddoom>	I got it sort of right ^_^;
07:19	<xtknight>	tom_, ah well let's try editing it manually
07:19	<xtknight>	tom_, type "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
07:19	<tom_>	k
07:19	<BlueStorm>	mm.. is there a way to find out my hostname?
07:19	<Doughy>	ok it brought up a window
07:20	<xtknight>	BlueStorm, cat /etc/hostname
07:20	<bofh80>	xtknight, ahh the old -phigh , never ever bloody worked for me. bloody thing . . :)
07:20	<tom_>	xtknight, opened
07:20	<xtknight>	bofh80, lol
07:20	<liquiddoom>	lol
07:20	<CarlFK>	n2diy: um, I am missing what you think is a problem.  did you look at the image?
07:20	<Phineas>	Doughy, go through and check the settings
07:20	<xtknight>	tom_, add the resolution to the bottom (1680x1050)
07:20	<NemesisD>	anybody?
07:20	<tom_>	xtknight, I have tried that before
07:20	<Doughy>	it's asking what driver I need
07:20	<tom_>	xtknight, didn't work for me
07:20	<Doughy>	I have no idea
07:21	<Kellster>	Can someone PLEASE help me with wireless on a DV9000 HP laptop.
07:21	<xtknight>	tom_, it really should, if you restart your X server.
07:21	<Phineas>	Nemesis: did you check that your password is correct?
07:21	<xtknight>	tom_, let's just try now and we will debug as we go
07:21	<tom_>	xtknight, can I add 1400x900 instead?
07:21	<Phineas>	Doughy: check this link, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto it is a good tutorial about resolution and screen settings
07:21	<xtknight>	tom_, yes you can add that but i'd recommend 'also' not 'instead'
07:21	<xtknight>	1680x1050 is your native
07:21	<Kellster>	Can someone PLEASE help me with wireless on a DV9000 HP laptop.
07:21	<cirkit>	I would like to know if Ubuntu has any affiliation with this site I found today?  http://gaybuntu.com/
07:21	<xtknight>	tom_, you will have to add it for each bit depth too at the bottom
07:21	<Phineas>	Kellster, what's the problem?
07:22	<n2diy>	CarlFK: no, I haven't looked at the image, but if you aren't running DNS,  how do you expect to resolve the ip address? Looking at the image now.
07:22	<Kellster>	Phineas - thanks in advance - I don't seem to be able to see any wireless networks at all.
07:22	<Moosejaw>	how do i change the MTU packet size?
07:22	<eoX>	!wpa
07:22	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
07:22	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, i think it's an option in sysctl
07:22	<Phineas>	Kellster, are you on Feisty?
07:22	<Kellster>	I aml
07:23	<Phineas>	k, hang on
07:23	<Moosejaw>	xtknight: how do i find what an ideal MTU setting is?
07:23	<fiery_cleric>	ifconfig
07:23	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, the one you're using now is probably fine
07:23	<tom_>	xtknight, so each section should be like: SubSection "Display"
07:23	<tom_>			Depth	24
07:23	<tom_>			Modes		"1680x1050" "1400x900" "1024x768"	"800x600"	"640x480"
07:23	<tom_>		EndSubSectio
07:23	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, why?  used to the windows MTU tweaks?  really dont need em these days
07:23	<cirkit>	what is gaybuntu ? is that some joke?
07:23	<cirkit>	or real?
07:24	<Moosejaw>	well i did a tweak test, and it said that the actual packets werent as large as i have set in MTU
07:24	<xtknight>	tom_, correct
07:24	<Phineas>	Kellster, I'm researching
07:24	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, i dont know, honestly
07:24	<Kellster>	Cool - thanks, phineas.
07:24	<Moosejaw>	no worries thanks
07:24	<tom_>	xtknight, done
07:24	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, i would just ignore the results of that test and instead use a download/upload speed test to see if you are satisfied with the speeds
07:24	<Raiders32>	hello, I'm using Dapper,  where are the kernel header files located?
07:24	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, and as long as your pings dont seem higher than nromal..
07:25	<xtknight>	Raiders32, /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`
07:25	<xtknight>	Raiders32, however you need the pkg.  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
07:25	<tom_>	xtknight, with what you said
07:25	<] Johnny[>	Alright, I just installed feisty, and creative is retarded as they have no linux drivers for their x-fi series, well I have usb headphones which is it's own soundcard, ubuntu detects it and i have all my settings set to 'usb sound' when i hit test i hear a loud beep but i get no actual system sounds
07:25	<Moosejaw>	xtknight: i am currently unpingable...how cani change that?
07:25	<xtknight>	tom_, save xorg.conf.  then press Ctrl Alt Backspace (this will close EVERYTHING beware)
07:25	<obble>	anyone have any recommedations on C++ IDEs ? Been using Kdevelop and its a PAIN!
07:25	<Raiders32>	xtknight:  thank you
07:25	<xtknight>	Moosejaw, iptables isnt blocking anything by default (not even ICMP).  im not sure.
07:25	<tom_>	ok then come back to the chat? xtknight ?
07:25	<xtknight>	tom_ yes
07:25	<NemesisD>	ugh ill just do a fresh install
07:26	<ardchoille>	obble: anjuta ?
07:26	<fiery_cleric>	obble: eclipse?
07:26	<Phineas>	Kellster, what kind of wireless card do you have?
07:26	<xtknight>	obble: geany?
07:26	<xtknight>	:)
07:26	<Hor|zon>	vim
07:26	<tom_>	xtknight, in retrospect that was a dumb question
07:26	<Hor|zon>	>.>
07:26	<Kellster>	Good question - how do I find out?
07:26	<obble>	hahaha I've been trying emacs... but if I have a project with 100 source files... i dont know how to manage that
07:26	<obble>	eclipse?
07:26	<xtknight>	Phineas, Kellster, "sudo lshw -class network"
07:26	<fiery_cleric>	obble:  the c++ support in eclipse is pretty good now
07:26	<Phineas>	yeah
07:27	<xtknight>	dont you need a plugin for eclipse C support
07:27	<obble>	ah ok
07:27	<xtknight>	or is it builtin?
07:27	<] Johnny[>	so, anyone know why I'm getting no soind from my usb headphones?
07:27	<Phineas>	thanks xtk
07:27	<] Johnny[>	sound*
07:27	<xjkx>	Is there a fluxbox unbutU ?
07:27	<obble>	is it easy to add source files and etc? ... cuz kdevelop doesnt like that haha
07:27	<xtknight>	xjkx, fluxbuntu
07:27	<Phineas>	Johnny, did you check their level in ALSA?
07:27	<xtknight>	!fluxbuntu | xjkx
07:27	<ubotu>	xjkx: fluxbuntu is a LPAE-standard compliant, Ubuntu-based derivative that maintains the goal of running on a wide range of mobile devices and computers (low-end & high-end). It is lightweight, swift and efficient. | Support Channel: #fluxbuntu on freenode | Homepage: http://fluxbuntu.org/
07:27	<] Johnny[>	uhh..no, how do I do that?
07:27	<Kellster>	Dell Wireless 1390 WLAN Mini-PCI Card
07:27	<Kellster>	Which is odd, since it is an HP DV9000
07:28	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to install realplayer? iv tried installing the .bin and it never works, im pretty sure i am installing it correctly also.
07:28	<xjkx>	why i cant see a fluxbuntu-desktop on apt-get ?
07:28	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Why do you only have one IP address listed for Linuxbox1, when you are showing a eth0 and wlan0 connections?
07:28	<xtknight>	xjkx, because it's not an official derivative
07:28	<xjkx>	:O
07:28	<Phineas>	Kellster, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsDell -- top of the page
07:28	<Diablo69er>	morning all
07:28	<xtknight>	xjkx, fluxbox is in there though the default config may be a bit undesirable ..i think i tried it once..
07:28	<CarlFK>	n2diy: a bridge only has one IP
07:28	<Kellster>	Checking.
07:28	<] Johnny[>	Phineas, how do I check the levels?
07:29	<compwiz18>	i've got a hard drive that doesn't automount and one of the partitions appears to have been deleted somehow...can anyone suggest a tool for retrieving partitions/files from ext3?
07:29	<Diablo69er>	I was wondering if anyone could help me find documenation on how to install virtual box on feisty--or if there is a better alternative
07:29	<ardchoille>	ctrl+alt+f1 never returns a prompt. It says "Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)" is this normal?
07:29	<Phineas>	Johnny, System ->	Pref ->	Sound
07:29	<xtknight>	compwiz18, "testdisk" for lost partitions
07:29	<dj-fu>	hit ctrl c
07:29	<xtknight>	compwiz18, sure the partition is gone though?
07:29	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, so eth0 and wlan0 share the same IP? interesting.
07:29	<xtknight>	compwiz18, it doesn't show in gparted?
07:29	<] Johnny[>	I have everything in their set to usb audio
07:29	<CarlFK>	n2diy: think of a hub or switch - it doesn't have any IP - it just passes packets around
07:29	<Diablo69er>	if any one can help me--PM me
07:29	<compwiz18>	xtknight: it shows in gparted as "unknown partition"
07:29	<King_InuYasha>	umm i installed feisty fawn last hour
07:30	<King_InuYasha>	and now i installed ndiswrapper tools
=== peeps is now known as peepsalot
07:30	<xtknight>	compwiz18, that's odd.  do you know the block device (/dev/hdx*)?
07:30	<compwiz18>	xtknight: testdisk finds it, and says it is deleted, although it allows me to look at file names
07:30	<King_InuYasha>	how do i set up ndiswrapper to use wlan0
07:30	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Roger that
07:30	<eoX>	i have a question about 7.04 does it have beryl has default window manager? and does it support atheros wireless/
07:30	<Phineas>	Johnny, what kind of sound usb is it?
07:30	<compwiz18>	xtknight, the block device is /dev/sdb1
07:30	<Phineas>	eoX, no it does not, Beryl is still unstable
07:30	<Phineas>	and yes it does support atheros
07:30	<Phineas>	with some work as I recall
07:30	<sam__>	hey
07:30	<sam__>	im back
07:31	<sam__>	how do you ftp acess your ubuntu
07:31	<sam__>	i have the ssh
07:31	<sam__>	installed
07:31	<jpsamara>	Beryl will merge with compiz anyway
07:31	<] Johnny[>	Plantronics headset
07:31	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Everything responds to broadcasted pings?
07:31	<kkathman>	!sound
07:31	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
07:31	<sam__>	but how do i use the ftp to acess the filefolders and add new file folders???
07:31	<liquiddoom>	sam__: You have to install an FTP server
07:31	<liquiddoom>	sam__: I use proftpd
07:31	<jpsamara>	So ubuntu has compiz and will continue to have it.. unless it changes its name
07:31	<sam__>	on linux
07:31	<fiery_cleric>	!ftpd
07:31	<sam__>	install it
07:31	<ubotu>	FTP servers: !ftpd, !proftpd, !pure-ftpd, !twoftpd, !vsftpd, !MuddleFTPd, !wzdftpd - Graphical front-ends: !PureAdmin, !GProftpd (for !GNOME), !KcmPureftpd (for !KDE) - See also !FTP
07:31	<sam__>	like installing webmin
07:31	<sam__>	how do i acess it
07:31	<Phineas>	Johnny: the above info from ubotu is good
07:31	<Diablo69er>	does virtual box even work on feisty?
07:31	<xtknight>	compwiz18, ok im gonna give you a command (but be careful how you type it)
07:31	<sam__>	the ftp server
07:31	<thebillywayne>	!QEme
07:31	<thebillywayne>	!QEmu
07:32	<eoX>	phineas ok thx i guess i will hold off my update then
07:32	<sam__>	do i just have a command module
07:32	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about qeme - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
07:32	<ubotu>	qemu is an emulator you can use to run another operating system - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPUnderQemuHowTo
07:32	<compwiz18>	xtknight: ok, I'll turn off my other external drives so I don't mess anything up
07:32	<liquiddoom>	sam__: I installed and configured proftpd from webmin. I think webmin can configure proftpd and wu-ftpd
07:32	<CarlFK>	n2diy: no.  if I give wlan an IP, I can ping what is connected to it.  when I make it part of the bridge, it 'breaks'
07:32	<sam__>	because i want it to be like webmin, just have a way to acess teh root folders and such from this computer
07:32	<xtknight>	compwiz18, "sudo dd if=/dev/sdb1 count=512 bs=1 | strings"  (make /sure/ not to replace if= with of= (the keys are next to each other))
07:32	<Phineas>	eoX, lemme find the atheros link I had
07:32	<tom_>	xtknight, alright well it added the 1600 one
07:32	<Diablo69er>	yeah I looked into a qemu--and it looked like a pain in the ass to install
07:32	<sam__>	want to run appahce
07:32	<xtknight>	tom_, it worked you mean?
07:32	<sam__>	do you know where you can s till download webmin??
07:32	<Phineas>	eox: http://www.michaellarabel.com/?k=blog&i=129
07:33	<liquiddoom>	sam__: I'll get the link
07:33	<mrj>	Hey All!
07:33	<sam__>	kk thxcs
07:33	<mrj>	Anyone from SoCali?
07:33	<tom_>	xtknight, yeah except 1400 x 900 isn't there and when I came back my top bar is all arranged very weird
07:33	<liquiddoom>	sam__: http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/webadmin/webmin_1.340_all.deb
07:33	<xtknight>	tom_, that's a byproduct of changing resolutions sometimes.  i dont know why 1440x900 isnt listed though :\\
07:33	<compwiz18>	xtknight: what is this command going to give me?
07:33	<tom_>	xtknight, like the time/clock/powerbuttong/wirelss got all rearranged
07:33	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Sounds like a problem in the bridge config?
07:33	<Diablo69er>	....well I guess not
07:33	<xtknight>	compwiz18, an idea of the first 512 bytes of your partition.  it can show problems sometimes
07:34	<Skiguy>	anyone have any ideas on why azureus wouldn't run after I upgraded to 7.04? running from the terminal I get a confuzing error. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16883/
07:34	<tom_>	xtknight, i am slow... it was there... i missed it
07:34	<xtknight>	compwiz18, you probably won't see any text at all.  but if you do it could indicate a problem..  i suggest pastebinning the output
07:34	<xtknight>	!pastebin
07:34	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
07:34	<CarlFK>	n2diy: could be.  any clue how I should set it up?
07:34	<Diablo69er>	take care
07:34	<Kellster>	Phineas - how do I install the driver as specificed in the documentation for the Dell?  run ndiswrapper from terminal?
07:34	<Diablo69er>	will be back later
07:34	<dburger>	how do I get to this new network manager I keep reading about?
07:34	<moDumass>	 /msg NickServ IDENTIFY password
07:35	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Google on the make and model of the bridge?
07:35	<CarlFK>	n2diy: back to no clue, eh?
07:35	<tom__>	xtknight, sorry irc closed somehow... prob my fault
07:35	<kahrytan>	Why is allot of people having problems with Feisty?
07:35	<xjkx>	does ubuntu comes with firefox?
07:35	<moDumass>	tom__ nah mine did it too
07:35	<xtknight>	tom__, so everything works huh?
07:35	<n2diy>	CarlFK: You and me both!
07:35	<danh>	so how do i turn on the wacky compiz effects?
07:35	<kahrytan>	xjkx: yes
07:35	<eck>	kahrytan: a lot of people are using it
07:35	<moDumass>	xjkx yeh it does
07:35	<Phineas>	Kellster, the ndiswrapper takes the Windows driver and wraps it making it work for Linux. The ndiswrapper wiki page should be able to walk you through the process.
07:35	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Why memorize what you can look up?
07:35	<xtknight>	kahrytan, a lot of them are problems with the edgy->feisty upgrade.  but there ALWAYS tons of problems in here ;P
07:35	<tom_>	xtknight, it appears so
07:36	<CarlFK>	n2diy: this is kinda what I awas working from, but not exactly the same goal] : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router
07:36	<kahrytan>	eck: Feisty works out of the box.
07:36	<tom_>	xtknight, so now I should be able to intall beryl???
07:36	<Tarkus>	anyone know how to install realplayer? iv tried installing the .bin and it never works, im pretty sure i am installing it correctly also.
07:36	<xtknight>	tom_ yup.
07:36	<eoX>	phineas sweetness looks great
07:36	<tom_>	xtknight, thank you so much for your help....
07:36	<kahrytan>	xtknight: that problem is that people never learn. :P from Dapper->	Edgy experience.
07:36	<xtknight>	kahrytan, i'd never dist-upgrade personally
07:36	<Skiguy>	Tarkus: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty
07:36	<Phineas>	Tarkus, am taking a look
07:36	<xtknight>	im way too hobbiest/picky/anal/particular or however you wnat to put it
07:36	<Kellster>	Phineas - that wiki page only shows how to install ndiswrapper - which worked fine.  I think i just need to do ndiswrapper -a devid driver - but not sure what devid to use, as wlan0 doesn't exist.
07:37	<compwiz18>	xtknight, 512+0 records in \ 512+0 records out \ 512 bytes (512 B) copied, 0.014595 seconds, 35.1 kB/s is the output
07:37	<xtknight>	tom_ glad i could
07:37	<xtknight>	compwiz18, and that is all?
07:37	<kahrytan>	xtknight: I didn't upgrade. And I don't have separate /home partition.
07:37	<compwiz18>	xtknight, that is all
07:37	<jpsamara>	Any real opensource package of virtualbox for ubuntu or debian?
07:37	<xtknight>	compwiz18, ah ok ... well neutral indicator i suppose (nothing wrong nothing right)
07:37	<tom_>	xtknight, I don't supose I can give you any kind of rating or vote or gold star.,.. etc for helping me on some site or anything
07:37	<moDumass>	heres a question for all the ubuntu ubergeeks, whenever i try to skype with the camera i use my gf`s windows laptop, but it always sh1tz itself, could i install skype windows in wine and use the camera there?
07:37	<xtknight>	tom_, no dont worry about it.  im happy that i helped you
07:38	<Phineas>	Kellster, we're approaching my limit of knowledge...
07:38	<xtknight>	tom_,
07:38	<xtknight>	just enjoy :P
07:38	<liquiddoom>	moDumass: I don't see why not, it's worth a try
07:38	<Phineas>	moDumass, theoretically yeah - I don't know why you couldnt
07:38	<xtknight>	compwiz18, well i would attempt recovery via testdisk
07:38	<tom_>	xtknight, will do... now the gf is saying its past my bedtime g2g
07:38	<Kellster>	Phineas - i understand - I'm just not sure if something else isn't wrong, given that there is no wlan0 showing in ifconfig at all - what do you think?
07:38	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what router are you using?
07:39	<BBHoss_>	is there any publisher-type software for ubuntu?
07:39	<tom_>	xtknight, its beryl tomorrow and video codecs!!!
07:39	<CarlFK>	n2diy: what are you calling a router?
07:39	<xtknight>	tom_, heh good luck youll need it
07:39	<compwiz18>	xtknight, I did that three times before asking on here, but nothing happens - it tells me it was successful, to reboot, and then nothing, but I can try again
07:39	<liquiddoom>	BBHoss_: Like scribus?
07:39	<moDumass>	Phineas, im going to google it and give it a try
07:39	<BBHoss_>	ok good
07:39	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what are you trying to use as a bridge?
07:39	<xtknight>	compwiz18, hrmm.  so it shows up as an 'unknown partition'...?
07:40	<compwiz18>	xtknight: yeah
07:40	<xtknight>	compwiz18, that means the superblock was damaged.  the first 512 bytes of the partition are not indicating that it is 'ext3'.  or the partition table does not contain the right data.  why dont you see whta this says for sdb1.  "sudo fdisk -l"
07:40	<liquiddoom>	BBHoss_: Scribus, Openoffice draw, and Inkscape are all good for such
07:40	<n2diy>	CarlFK: Ok, what are you trying to use as a bridge? Your Ubuntu box?
07:40	<Phineas>	I honestly don't know Kellster, sorry man
07:40	<CarlFK>	n2diy: yes - LinuxBox1.  did you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router ?
07:40	<ajmorris_>	how do i stop the gnome desktop manager from starting nautilus on startup?
07:40	<Kellster>	Ok - cool, phineas.  Thanks for the try.  Should I ask other here, or go to another source?
07:41	<compwiz18>	xtknight, /dev/sda1   *           1        4865    39078081   83  Linux is the output for the hdd
07:41	<eck>	ajmorris_: you need nautilus... if it wasn't loaded you wouldn't even get a background
07:41	<Phineas>	go ahead and see if someone else here knows, otherwise surf google for a while
07:41	<ajmorris_>	eck, i am using xfdesktop with gnome
07:41	<xtknight>	Kellster, wireless problems are difficult to fix sometimes but just hang out here.  somebody will be able to help you.  or search the forums there's almost always solutions if you dig deep
07:41	<thebillywayne>	I'm trying to run windows in feisty with QEmu.  when I try to create the virtual drive for windows, I get, qemu-img: Error while formatting.
07:41	<xtknight>	compwiz18, did you say it was sdb1 or sda1 that was having trouble?
07:41	<thebillywayne>	what am I doing wrong?
07:41	<kkathman>	!sound
07:41	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
07:41	<n2diy>	CarlFK: I started too, but there is a lot of stuff there, and it will take me some time to do so.
07:42	<eck>	ajmorris_: you would have to change the gnome session files
07:42	<ajmorris_>	eck, where are they located?
07:42	<Kellster>	Can someone help me installing Dell wireless drivers via ndiswrapper?
07:42	<compwiz18>	xtknight: i have two external drives, it depends which order they powered up.  I thought it was sdb but it is actually sda, sorry if it is confusing
07:42	<neilther1>	hey  all
07:42	<Amaranth>	ajmorris_: you'd have to modify the gnome-session source
07:42	<Crazytom>	Kellster, what chipset is it?
07:42	<xtknight>	compwiz18, ah the UUID system can help with that.  but that's far too confusing for me :p
07:42	<kkathman>	i wonder if someone could please help me with some lack of sound in feisty?
07:42	<CarlFK>	n2diy: then I doubt you can be much help.  i suggest finding the part that says "First install the necessary tools to create a network bridge, "
07:42	<mikeo2>	lol ubuntu finally overtook the gentoo channel for users
07:43	<Crazytom>	Kellster, do sudo lspci -v
07:43	<neilther1>	Crazytom: thanks for helping me with my wireless card last time
07:43	<xtknight>	compwiz18, hmm if it's /dev/sda now and that's the output that's mighty confusing.  i dont know what '83' is supposed to mean.  "sudo fdisk -l" should not be saying 83, it should be saying Linux :\
07:43	<ajmorris_>	Amaranth, where is the source located?
07:43	<neilther1>	this is neil the reil deil
07:43	<moDumass>	hmmm, i dont think im skilled enough for skype in wine
07:43	<eck>	ajmorris_: i don't remember, iirc there is somewhere with the .desktop files for all the programs that are started and nautilus will be in there somewhere
07:43	<neilther1>	i kinda killed my computer again
07:43	<Amaranth>	mikeo2: we've been at roughly this size since Ubuntu 6.10 came out
07:43	<Amaranth>	ajmorris_: you know C?
07:43	<kahrytan>	Where is the userlist box for xchat?
07:43	<Tarkus>	Skiguy: why did you send me that link?
07:43	<Crazytom>	neilther1, np
07:43	<n2diy>	CarlFK: I'm wasting your time, good luck. I thought this was a simple network. Take care.
07:43	<neilther1>	can u please help recover X fo me?
07:43	<Amaranth>	kahrytan: click on the "1223 Users" text
07:43	<mikeo2>	last time i was here it was around 900, and gentoo had 1k
07:44	<neilther1>	i was doing stuff with firefox
07:44	<neilther1>	in X
07:44	<Crazytom>	neilther1, me?
07:44	<MTecknology>	I have a server with low enough activity that I can sacrifice it's bandwidth. I have unxutils installed and a special folder to download the songs to. The site is http://3es.bounceme.net:8000/ampache/login.php and I have access to it. I can get a browsing list of all songs, click the song, then click download to download a single song. What I want to do is download ALL songs from the server. How could I do thisd? - - a direct lin
07:44	<MTecknology>	k to the song looks like this - http://3es.bounceme.net:8000/ampache/play/index.php?song=5226&uid=Mike&sid=6bd7703db6f92527a6e2b5a6bd85e555&name=Mindless%20Self%20Indulgence%20-%20thank%20god.mp3
07:44	<compwiz18>	xtknight: I'll see if I can figure out what 83 stands for
07:44	<Amaranth>	mikeo2: right before 7.04 came out (like a week before) we lost a lot of users
07:44	<neilther1>	and it entereed a typoe of livelock
07:44	<ajmorris_>	Amaranth, i shouldn't need to... there is a gnome-desktop.desktop file somewhere.... however i couldn't find it in /etc/init.d
07:44	<xtknight>	compwiz18, well 0x83 = a Linux partition
07:44	<neilther1>	and the page file was being used like crazy
07:44	<kahrytan>	Amaranth: What?
07:44	<xtknight>	compwiz18, as far as i know but hold on.  it shouldnt be printing 83 though
07:44	<Amaranth>	neilther1: are you using compiz or beryl?
07:44	<compwiz18>	xtknight: ok
07:44	<Amaranth>	kahrytan: click on the "1223 Users" text
07:44	<danh>	how do i turn on the compiz action
07:44	<neilther1>	the harddisk light was constantly on, not blinking
07:44	<kahrytan>	Amaranth: What text? Where?
07:44	<xtknight>	compwiz18, never mind im just crazy
07:45	<neilther1>	and the computer locked up and wasnt responding
07:45	<Amaranth>	kahrytan: bottom right corner?
07:45	<liquiddoom>	Desktop Effects. Enable it from there
07:45	<mikeo2>	anyone want to help me with my homework?
07:45	<Amaranth>	kahrytan: are you using xchat-gnome?
07:45	<xtknight>	compwiz18, but is it printing "Linux" after that 83?  your paste got cut off
07:45	<kahrytan>	Amaranth: doesn't exist
07:45	<DoctorOwl>	mike00: Yes please!
07:45	<Crazytom>	neilther1, restarting doesn't fix it?
07:45	<neilther1>	so i turned off the computer by the power button
07:45	<DoctorOwl>	mikeo2
07:45	<DoctorOwl>	(Sarcasm) :D
07:45	<neilther1>	i think i messed up something in the filesystem
07:45	<xtknight>	compwiz18, yeah never mind it was printing Linux too and i just didnt see it.
07:45	<compwiz18>	xtknight, here it is again: /dev/sda1   *           1        4865    39078081   83  Linux
07:45	<kahrytan>	Amaranth: Nope. I said Xchat.
07:45	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	kahrytan, on the right margin, make the arrow pull it out
07:45	<Amaranth>	kahrytan: I don't know what you're using then. Xchat has it just there and xchat-gnome has it as a popup from the text
07:45	<neilther1>	because i cut the power while it was performing disk i/o
07:45	<mikeo2>	take a survey for my ethics homework, i will be writing a paper on peoples views on different forms of piracy http://www.salukiville.com/survey/index.php?sid=1
07:45	<Whiz2>	can someone here suggest a pop3 email server that i can apt-get install and run without having to do anything else?
07:45	<mikeo2>	thanks
07:45	<neilther1>	and not x doesnt start
07:45	<neilther1>	please help
07:45	<neilther1>	!!
07:46	<kahrytan>	I use Xchat, not xchat-gnome.
07:46	<Kellster>	Crazytom - not sure - can you tell me how to find out?
07:46	<neilther1>	i cant sart x
07:46	<Whiz2>	i tried qpopper that way, but it didn't get the full install
07:46	<xtknight>	compwiz18, okay that means your partition table is fine.  ext3 superblock is corrupt.  all i can suggest is further screwing around with testdisk.  are you actually telling it to commit changes to disk?  i mean, what is it saying?  corrupt MFT/MBR?
07:46	<neilther1>	hopw can i chkdsk /?
07:46	<Crazytom>	Kellster, sudo lspci -v
07:46	<neilther1>	if its already mounted?
07:46	<Crazytom>	neilther1, startx?
07:46	<xtknight>	neilther1, fscking on a mounting volume is very dangerous
07:46	<xtknight>	moutned*
07:46	<neilther1>	can i tell it to scheckdisk before it mounts on next reboot?
07:46	<neilther1>	Crazytom: yea
07:46	<neilther1>	yea
07:46	<moDumass>	is there anyway to get video support for skype in ubuntu? or is that a skype-dream
07:46	<xtknight>	neilther1, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=295262
07:46	<neilther1>	how can i fsck when / is not mounted?
07:47	<Crazytom>	neilther1, it worked?

07:47	<kkathman>	Amaranth,  greetings would you be able to help me with a sound issue in Feisty, please?
07:47	<Phineas>	Any recommendations on a good Python IDE?
07:47	<xtknight>	neilther1, fsck.ext3 /dev/blockDEVICE
07:47	<MrBarkyVonShnauz>	is there a way to reinstall the tty conglomerate to make it work?  I've tried the 'sudo passwd username' route
07:47	<neilther1>	xtknight: its mounted
07:47	<neilther1>	how can i check that?
07:47	<compwiz18>	xtknight: let me paste what testdisk shows the current partition structure to be
07:47	<Amaranth>	kkathman: all i know about sound is that mine only started working in 7.10
07:47	<xtknight>	neilther1, what is mounted
07:47	<xtknight>	neilther1, / will always be mounted
07:47	<KarlosII>	Does anyone or the bot know the correct address for the sources for freenx?
07:47	<Doughy>	Phineas, no luck
07:48	<xtknight>	compwiz18, okay
07:48	<ajmorris_>	eck, Aramanth, nvm i have just edited /~/.gnome2/session and it works
07:48	<Crazytom>	Kellster, do you have the .inf file you want to install that you are sure goes with your card?
07:48	<KarlosII>	http://free.linux.hp.com/~brett/seveas/freenx <--- is what I have currently
07:48	<compwiz18>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16974/
07:48	<Doughy>	I ran that re-config thing, messed up, tried it again, and got back to where I was
07:48	<Jtkiefer>	I've still never figured out why the pastebin is only on ubuntu netherlands
07:48	<kkathman>	Amaranth,  I have an SB Live and it was working fine in Dappy and Edgy, but I fresh installed Feisty and no go
07:48	<Jtkiefer>	not that it really matters but it still seems odd
07:48	<n2diy>	xtknight: thank you, I was wondering how his box was working if / wasn't mounted.
07:48	<neilther1>	is there a way i can make it scan before mounting on next boot or something?
07:48	<Kellster>	I just downloaded the Win XP exe file from the Dell website (even though this is an HP laptop) - but that isn't an inf.  Extract somehow?
07:48	<neilther1>	of load chkdsk to memory, unmount /, and the scan hda?
07:48	<xtknight>	neilther1, use bonager to schedule a fsck
07:48	<kahrytan>	Oh. I found the userlist. doh.
07:48	<kosnick>	i upgraded to feisty but now the "network monitor" won;t show me the network speed, any suggestions?

07:49	<neilther1>	it coul be because of the cold shut down last time
07:50	<crimsun>	nr4g3d: manpages-dev

07:50	<Andruk>	xtknight: yep, just thought you might want to know
07:50	<compwiz18>	xtknight: yeah, my working drive doesn't have double entries
07:50	<xtknight>	compwiz18, what did you press to get it to show that?
07:50	<Crazytom>	neilther1, you're probably going to have to reinstall
07:50	<mikeo2>	the person from nj is correct
07:50	<Kellster>	crazytom - it opens in archive manager
07:50	<xtknight>	Andruk, sure did.  thanks ill let others with similar problems know

07:57	<xtknight>	compwiz18, i had more luck with a version of testdisk newer than that in the repositories, for what it's worth.  i would try the latest development build they have.  it is worth a try if the data is vital
07:57	<Kellster>	OK
07:57	<tehquickness>	Does anyone have any idea on what could be causing this?
07:57	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, nope, only for nvidia. don't have wireless or anything like that
07:57	<crimsun>	kkathman: perhaps. Your onboard audio chipset (driven by snd-via82xx) is the default one, index 0. Is that what you want?
07:57	<compwiz18>	xtknight, ok, give me a minute
07:57	<xtknight>	compwiz18, i'm going to have to go now

07:58	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: try removing all the linux-restricted-modules packages and the like, nvidia-glx and such. You could also download a script named "Envy" (if you give me a sec I'll get you the link) and do a full clean deinstall of the nvidia driver.
07:58	<Lunarspore>	hi all
07:58	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, oh.. envy is supported now? it wasn't a few days ago
07:58	<crimsun>	kkathman: you can then either reboot, or unload all the alsa modules then reload them

08:00	<tehquickness>	hmmm
08:00	<crimsun>	kkathman: you can then either reboot, or unload all the alsa modules then reload them

08:00	<Lunarspore>	crdlb: ah thanks :)
08:00	<tehquickness>	Burgundavia, so when I use the one from ATI then I should be using the fglrx?
08:00	<Kellster>	Crazytom, I'm there.
08:00	<kkathman>	crimsun,  not sure how to do the unload, so maybe I reboot and that does the same thing?
08:00	<Amaranth>	yay, crimsun to the rescue
08:00	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, it didn't say anything other than "fatal: error installing module nvidia"

08:01	<neilther1>	for the sony pcg-r505jl
08:01	<phixnay>	workbean: since feisty switches all cdroms to sata, and not all of them will work like that, I need to go back to edgy until the bug is fixed
08:01	<Burgundavia>	Amaranth: I think crimsun has alsa highlighted :)
08:01	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: that's okay, try running the nvidia installer with the --uninstall option. Then remove anything that looks like linux-restricted-modules and nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common too
08:01	<Amaranth>	neilther1: paste the output of 'lspci | grep -i vga'
08:01	<liz>	weird
08:01	<neilther1>	how can i install the driver for that?
08:01	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: then restart the computer, download the nvidia installer and try installing it
08:02	<Burgundavia>	phixnay: no, feisty uses a different way to access ata drives, not switching them to sata

08:07	<dannydrifffft>	hi, can anyone tell me how do i change the resolution of the setup? i can not choose OK when trying to install ubuntu
08:07	<neilther1>	how can i get X back/
08:07	<DARKGuy>	Amaranth, Burgundavia, crdlb: I don't see the problem of a script that solves most stuff that would've been solved with tons of googling and such. Everyone is free to use the stuff they want... come on, we're not M$ who decides what are people going to install and what not. Yet, this is not the place to discuss this so this is my last message about the topic.
08:07	<phixnay>	Andy2: double click on the torrent file
08:07	<captaintrips>	download a torrent file?
08:07	<compwiz18>	Amaranth: ATI 200M
08:07	<captaintrips>	lol
08:07	<neilther1>	it stopped working after i killed the power
08:07	<crdlb>	neilther1, I have no idea what was broken, so I don't know how you could fix i
08:07	<Burgundavia>	Andy2: find a torrent file, download it and douple click on it
08:07	<crdlb>	it*
08:07	<neilther1>	i might have messed up the fs
08:07	<Andy2>	oh
08:07	<Andy2>	thx :P
08:07	<morphius_>	Andy2: I recommend scrapetorrent.com
08:07	<morphius_>	to find torrents
08:07	<captaintrips>	or torrentspy
08:07	<phixnay>	ocremix has good torrents : P
08:07	<Burgundavia>	DARKGuy: if there is something that is known to cause serious issues, we are going to recommend against it
08:08	<Madpilot>	morphius_, discussion of piracy is always offtopic here, thanks
08:08	<redDEAD>	i installed the ati driver in fesity and now totem is dislaying my videos in blue any ideas?
08:08	<Amaranth>	morphius_, captaintrips: Discussion of illegal activities is not allowed here
08:08	<neilther1>	please help fix X
08:08	<Andy2>	no backdoor viruses?
08:08	<wizard>	crimsun: hey did you ever reply to my question?
08:08	<DARKGuy>	Burgundavia: why then, someone makes a script that does the same thing, in the "recommended" way? ;)
08:08	<wizard>	crimsun: i was afk
08:08	<crdlb>	DARKGuy, drivers installed with envy will break after kernel upgrades, and will most likely cause problems if you try to upgrade distro versions
08:08	<captaintrips>	rgr
08:08	<BBHoss_>	can i run a dist-upgrade to go from 7.04 RC to final?
08:08	<Burgundavia>	BBHoss_: yes
08:08	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an error trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?
08:09	<Amaranth>	BBHoss_: If you had the RC and you don't have any updates to get in synaptic you have the final
08:09	<morphius_>	Madpilot: Torrent search != Piracy
08:09	<phixnay>	neilther1: try running through sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, it always helps me out
08:09	<captaintrips>	not really... but usually
08:09	<captaintrips>	lol
08:09	<morphius_>	Madpilot: I can search for ubuntu there for instance.
08:09	<Burgundavia>	morphius_: regardless, it is off topic here
08:09	<DARKGuy>	crdlb: however, I've seen it uninstalls the nvidia driver in a good way - it hasn't broke my system up. It didn't in Edgy nor it hasn't in Fawn
08:09	<neilther1>	when i run mount, it shows hda1 mounted as /
08:09	<Madpilot>	morphius_, there's no need to go to sites like that to get Ubuntu via torrent...
08:09	<crimsun>	wizard: the only nick-highlight lines in my away log are triggered by a prepended "crimsun," or "crimsun:". If "crimsun" is anywhere else in the statement, I won't get it logged. So - to answer your question - no. I have no lines from your client in my awaylog.
08:09	<neilther1>	and it says, (rw,errors=remount-ro)
08:09	<phixnay>	lololol
08:09	<neilther1>	what does that mean?
08:09	<linoleum_>	Guys, I 've got a question about synaptic and the option "Consider recommended packages as dependencies"... I 've checked it, but for example, anjuta recommends G++, but if I want to install anjuta, synaptics doenst install G++ ... why ?
08:09	<Amaranth>	neilther1: that sounds fine
08:10	<neilther1>	what does the error part mean?
08:10	<wizard>	crimsun: i was curious if the sound issue i was having was resolved in the final release of feisty
08:10	<goban>	torrents are just another protocol, just like http, nothing bad about them
08:10	<Amaranth>	neilther1: if the only problem is that you don't get a GUI run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg'
08:10	<dannydrifffft>	hi, can anyone tell me how do i change the resolution of the setup? i can not choose OK when trying to install ubuntu
08:10	<IncredibleHink>	i need some help with my hotswap bay please
08:10	<wizard>	crimsun: i recall you saying you had located it
08:10	<Amaranth>	neilther1: that just means if it detects an error it'll remount the partition read-only to prevent damage
08:10	<crimsun>	wizard: no, it's not. I've fixed it, and the fix has been committed. It will be available in the first post-release kernel upload.
08:10	<RobbieCrash>	After installing ssh there shouldn't be anything I need to do to be able to connect to my box via ssh should there be?
08:10	<neilther1>	so i should run that?
08:10	<wizard>	crimsun: kk, so i should hold out for a week or two?
08:10	<Amaranth>	neilther1: yes
08:10	<Burgundavia>	dannydrifffft: afaik, there is no way. You can try and resize the window. If that doesn't work, download the alternate cd and use that
08:10	<neilther1>	i should run run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg'
08:11	<neilther1>	?
08:11	<Amaranth>	wizard: probably more like 3-4 weeks
08:11	<neilther1>	ok
08:11	<RobbieCrash>	!ssh
08:11	<ubotu>	SSH is the Secure SHell protocol. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHHowto for usage. Putty is a nice SSH client for Windows; it can be found at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
08:11	<Amaranth>	neilther1: If you don't have X, yes
08:11	<wizard>	Amaranth: :-( I'll be in navy boot camp by then!
08:11	<crimsun>	wizard: I have provided replacement modules if you read bug 105582
08:12	<wizard>	crimsun: its alright man if its gonna be a long long time before it gets finalized im not in any worries.
08:12	<neilther1>	it said its not gonna update /etc/X11/X; file has been customized
08:12	<gg_hp57>	how do i remove a directory only if there are no files or sub dirs located in that directory?
08:12	<wizard>	crimsun: as i said, im getting sworn into the navy on teusday... I likely wont be here
08:12	<Burgundavia>	gg_hp57: delete it?
08:12	<neilther1>	i have x
08:12	<neilther1>	ive been using startX to get X
08:12	<compwiz18>	can anyone tell me how to restore an ext3 backup superblock?
08:12	<neilther1>	and after killing the power, X broke
08:12	<gg_hp57>	Burgundavia: yes
08:12	<frutax>	So far I have successfully upgraded to Feisty and fixed my laptop screen resolution, but I when i do the beryl install script, the nvidia drivers still do not seem to get installed. in my xorg.conf the device driver says "nv". how should i fix this problem?
08:12	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an error trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?  The error is "gconfaudiosrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=chat: Could not open resource for writing."
08:12	<crdlb>	gg_hp57, rmdir will only work for empty directories iirc
08:13	<NemesisD>	ok guys im having too many darn problems upgrading, it should be pretty easy to format JUST the ubuntu partition on a multiboot system and install feisty right?
08:13	<Burgundavia>	frutax: beryl instlal script? where are you getting beryl from?
08:13	<phixnay>	I'm having trouble with my cd drive, and people on the forum say to check launchpad for a bug report, but I don't know how to find it
08:13	<Ax4>	NemesisD, yes
08:13	<neilther1>	ok
08:13	<Kix>	gg_hp57: rmdir dir
08:13	<frutax>	Burgundavia: from the beryl-project.org wiki
08:13	<neilther1>	i ran startx afgain and it crashed
08:13	<neilther1>	caught signal 11
08:13	<neilther1>	server aborting
08:13	<Burgundavia>	frutax: use the packages in the ubuntu repositories
08:13	<NemesisD>	everything is all tweaked out right now
08:14	<phixnay>	neilther1: did you try dpkg-reconfigure? sorry I wasn't paying attention
08:14	<zPacKRat>	rm -d -r dirname
08:14	<neilther1>	XIO: fatal error 104 (Connection reset by peer) on Xserver ":0.0" after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining
08:14	<zPacKRat>	-d for directory and -r for recursive
08:15	<neilther1>	what does that mean?
08:15	<neilther1>	that only happened after i ran that command
08:15	<neilther1>	before that, i saw a glimpse of X, and then it dioes
08:15	<frutax>	Burgundavia: which packages? for nvidia?
08:15	<neilther1>	died*
08:15	<Burgundavia>	frutax: after you install beryl from the ubuntu repos, install nvidia as per the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
08:16	<exs>	Hello. I'm using ubuntu edgy, and I'm trying to add my music folder on the places menu at the top. I cannot find out how to do this, so if you know, could you tell me?.. thanks very much.
08:16	<crdlb>	exs, add it using a file open dialog
08:16	<cables>	exs, open the places sidebar in nautilus
08:16	<chowmeined>	crimsun: thank you, but I use rhythmbox
08:17	<cables>	exs, both ways work, but i find it easier to open the Places sidebar in your file browser and simply drag it in.
08:17	<drumline_>	I get the wonderful whine screen with Beryl at the moment.  I see on the forums that downgrading fixes it, but I can wait...  It's not that important.
08:17	<exs>	crdlb:  where is the file open dialogue?.. cable where's the places folder ?
08:17	<drumline_>	Although, I still want it.  :)
08:17	<drumline_>	Has anyone gotten Ubuntu working with Sonicwall GroupVPN?
08:17	<cables>	exs, open the folder your music folder is in, go to View and enable Side Pane, and in the side pane select Places from the dropdown list. Then drag your music folder into that sidepane.
08:18	<ypSami>	why is it that every single time I try to install any kind of theme, i get "File format invalid"
08:18	<cables>	ypSami, what type of theme, and what's the file format?
08:18	<Burgundavia>	ypSami: where are you getting the themes from?
08:18	<exs>	thanks cables crdlb
08:18	<ypSami>	I'm getting them from gnome-look
08:18	<Malaysian_Linux>	how to connect to internet using dial-up account? which software should i use?
08:18	<Robbie_Crash>	After reading that howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
08:18	<ypSami>	I'm following a tutorial
08:19	<umop>	When I try open sound recorder a message saying my settings are incorrect, when i go into sound preferences I get an error trying to test sound capture, how can i find the cause?  The error is "gconfaudiosrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=chat: Could not open resource for writing."
08:19	<Burgundavia>	ypSami: from where?
08:19	<ypSami>	http://www.taimila.com/ubuntuosx.php#themes
08:19	<skullhead>	dos any one know an good taskbar themes?
08:19	<Lunarspore>	crdlb: is there any way I can tell if a fix for this bug has been created and how I can apply it?  (kind of a linux newbie here, sorry)
08:19	<cables>	ypSami, you should just take the tar.gz or tar.bz2 and drag it into the themes window (System>Preferences>Themes
08:19	<IncredibleHink>	i need some help with my hotswap bay please
08:19	<Burgundavia>	ypSami: you need to install those via  System >	Preferences >Themes
08:19	<Burgundavia>	IncredibleHink: what is the issue?
08:19	<crdlb>	Lunarspore, I'm not sure, I found this bug helping someone else with the problem
08:19	<ypSami>	So, it wants the actual archive.
08:19	<ypSami>	I unpacked the archive.
08:19	<exs>	cables:  how do I remove an icon from the places menu?
08:19	<Malaysian_Linux>	how to connect to internet using dial-up account? which software should i use?
08:20	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, i need to figure out why gnome partition editor doesnt see the drive when i activate it in the bay
08:20	<neilther1>	how can i reinstall X?
08:20	<skullhead>	ya i mean like dos kde have cooler looking taskbars?
08:20	<cables>	exs, remove it from that sidebar.
08:20	<ypSami>	Lovely how the GUI doesn't explain that.
08:20	<exs>	I accidently put in the show desktop icon in places. i don't want it there
08:20	<cables>	ypSami, it explains it just fine.
08:20	<exs>	it's not in the sidebar bit in neutalis (explroer)
08:20	<neilther1>	i wana reinstall X
08:20	<Madpilot>	ypSami, don't bother unpacking the archive - just open the window Burgundavia pointed you to, then drag the archive file into that window.
08:20	<ypSami>	cables: Where?
08:20	<exs>	ignore m
08:20	<neilther1>	do i need the ubuntu CD?
08:20	<exs>	ignore me*
08:20	<FernLujan>	hey guys
08:20	<exs>	it's in there
08:20	<FernLujan>	can anyone help me with a keybinding problem?
08:20	<cables>	ypSami, it's pretty intuitive, there's no explanation needed. Also, it's probably in the Help.
08:20	<mikeo2>	did fiesty include the new symbolic linker thing that stores stuff in a hash and speeds up performance by like 200 percent?
08:20	<neilther1>	or can i reinstall X from apt?
08:20	<skullhead>	dos KDE have cool looker looking taskbars?
08:21	<Burgundavia>	IncredibleHink: how is the hotswap drive connected? ide cable?
08:21	<chowmeined>	mikeo2: the shared library cache dealy?
08:21	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, sata
08:21	<ypSami>	cables: So out of the millions of file formats, it's intuitive for me to know that I should use the archive itself? I use TAR for 1000 other things.
08:21	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, like my other two permanently installed drives
08:21	<naut>	Is there anyway to copy a raw dvd image?
08:21	<ypSami>	cables: Intuition doesn't come into play here. That's a gotcha.
08:21	<mikeo2>	yeah does open office open a lot faster in it?
08:21	<chowmeined>	mikeo2: I had heard it was supposed to, but programs seem to take longer to start in feisty instead, maybe I don't have it running
08:21	<Madpilot>	ubotu, themes | ypSami
08:21	<ubotu>	ypSami: Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://art.gnome.org - http://www.kde-look.org - http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/58/ - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
08:21	<cables>	ypSami, that is true, it should support uncompressed folders.
08:22	<FernLujan>	could anyone help me with a keybinding problem?
08:22	<cables>	!ask | FernLujan
08:22	<ubotu>	FernLujan: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
08:22	<Madpilot>	ypSami, see the last URL in the blurb the bot just gave you above
08:22	<chowmeined>	mikeo2: With open office there is an option to have it preload in the task bar, and then it starts almost instantly if you want to try that
08:22	<ypSami>	Thanks Madpilot
08:22	<cables>	!anyone | FernLujan
08:22	<ubotu>	FernLujan: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
08:22	<Robbie_Crash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
08:22	<Shadow_X>	I just installed Fiesty, I need some help installing the nVidia drivers
08:22	<cables>	Shadow_X, did it prompt you when you started it?
08:22	<Shadow_X>	X keeps failing with error "no screens found"
08:23	<Shadow_X>	no
08:23	<FernLujan>	Is it possible to assign a key to a command? Say I want the key "F2" to execute the command "3ddesk --mode=priceisright". Is there any way of doing this?
08:23	<Shadow_X>	when I first installed it and booted, X failed
08:23	<Shadow_X>	I deleted xorg.conf
08:23	<Shadow_X>	and X started
08:23	<sharkiezz>	-+
08:23	<sharkiezz>	321
08:23	<Shadow_X>	now Ive made a blank xorg.conf, but I need X to write the correct information to it
08:23	<BeBraw>	can anyone recommend a cheap wlan adapter that works well on feisty (amd64)?
08:23	<Shadow_X>	cuz Im still farily new to this stuff
08:23	<chowmeined>	Is there anything that has at least some of the features like azureus but runs for gnome (hopefully written in C)?
08:23	<Madpilot>	ubotu, fixres | Shadow_X
08:23	<ubotu>	Shadow_X: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
08:23	<FernLujan>	Is it possible to assign a key to a command? Say I want the key "F2" to execute the command "3ddesk --mode=priceisright". Is there any way of doing this?
08:24	<Robbie_Crash>	chowmeined why not use azureus?
08:24	<crdlb>	FernLujan, yes, afaik you have to use gconf-editor to set it though
08:24	<crdlb>	FernLujan, look in /apps/metacity/
08:24	<chowmeined>	Robbie_Crash: because it is a garbage java app, bloated, leaks memory, throws up errors all the time and crashes if I use sun java 6
08:24	<frutax>	I get the nvidia spashscreen now, that you to who helped me fix that, but even though the beryl applet shows up, beryl is not working, and i have a stange problem with my clock applet being in the middle of the top of my screen instead of all the way to the right
08:24	<FernLujan>	crdbl: thanks
08:25	<oldude67>	how do i get limewire to work ? says file cant be found
08:25	<zcat[1] >	system >	preferences >	keyboard shortcuts  ?
08:25	<FernLujan>	actually
08:25	<Robbie_Crash>	chowmeined I dunno of anything that works like azureus does, that's not it, sorry
08:25	<liquiddoom>	zcat[1] : That won't let you add a custom command
08:25	<zcat[1] >	hmm, perhaps not...
08:25	<DShepherd>	oldude67, try frostwire... its just like limewire..
08:25	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, SATA
08:25	<chowmeined>	Robbie_Crash: ok thank you
08:25	<Robbie_Crash>	frutax that used to happen to me, I had to uninstall and reinstall beryl
08:25	<oldude67>	tried that and it wont see my java
08:26	<frutax>	Robbie_Crash: thanks
08:26	<Burgundavia>	IncredibleHink: sorry, I am digging for information. It is likely that you system is not seeing the drive
08:26	<DShepherd>	oldude67, oh ok
08:26	<oldude67>	dshepherd, tried that and it didnt see my java
08:26	<Robbie_Crash>	frutax no problem, if it still persists try asking in #beryl
08:26	<smt6k>	Anyone else have the problem where gksu doesn't grab the screen and ask for the password, it just sits as an idle process in the background?
08:26	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, you mean my bios?
08:26	<Robbie_Crash>	although I think they're all sleeping
08:26	<DShepherd>	oldude67, you have java installed right?
08:26	<Burgundavia>	IncredibleHink: either that or ubuntu
08:26	<smt6k>	but then the second time you try it, it works, but there's still the old gksu
08:26	<FernLujan>	crdbl: how do I actually do this?
08:27	<FernLujan>	I'm in apps/metacity in gconf-editor
08:27	<FernLujan>	but I'm not sure how to add a key
08:27	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, while you digging,.... let me reboot and make sure my bios allows hotswapping, that sata port is enabled and all that stuff
08:27	<IncredibleHink>	Burgundavia, brb
08:27	<tehseen>	Any idea how to install the motorola q smart phone, it wont come up as ttyUSB0
08:27	<ypSami>	OOoo. Now this is nice. A brand new fiesty running beryl, skinned like OSX =D
08:27	<oldude67>	shepherd: ya did the apt-get and have java 6 installed
08:27	<chowmeined>	Robbie_Crash: I am looking at deluge, ill see how that works out
08:27	<ypSami>	The blasphemy of it all is enthralling =D
08:27	<DShepherd>	oldude67, that's odd. beats me
08:27	<tehseen>	any help for smart phones anyone might know?
08:27	<Robbie_Crash>	chowmeined let me know if it runs nicely/better than azureus
08:28	<crdlb>	FernLujan, do you see global_keybindings and keybinding_commands ?
08:28	<oldude67>	shepherd: but when i go to terminal to frostwire it says i need 1.5
08:28	<FernLujan>	crdbl: yes
08:28	<crdlb>	FernLujan, under keybinding_commands, put the command you want run for command_1
08:28	<moosejaw>	hey all...i seriously messed up my machine when i messed with /etc/fstab...now i cant load in X, and my file system is read only, so i cant change it back now...what do i do?
08:28	<crdlb>	FernLujan, then under global_keybindings, set run_command_1 to F2
08:29	<kapputu>	are there any known issues with an Atheros wireless chipsets on Thinkpads? I can connect with another PCMCIA card but not with the built-in wireless from my Thinkpad Z61t
08:29	<kapputu>	I'm running Feisty and my wireless card is detected, just that there is no connectivity
08:29	<Robbie_Crash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
08:29	<Kix>	moosejaw: Rule no. 1. Create backups :p
08:29	<FernLujan>	under value, I enter the command?
08:29	<Crazytom>	moosejaw, i'm sorry but that's pretty funny
08:30	<crdlb>	FernLujan, for command_1 yes
08:30	<FernLujan>	crdbl: thanks
08:30	<moosejaw>	kix there is a backup...but i cant save it to overwrite
08:30	<moosejaw>	or u mean my machine
08:30	<moosejaw>	hehe
08:30	<crdlb>	FernLujan, then set run_command_1 to: F2
08:30	<BlueStorm>	ubuntux is workin eye
08:30	<crdlb>	or whatever key you want to use
08:30	<r_rehashed>	hey everybody
08:30	<FernLujan>	crdbl: yep :) got it. thanks a bunch
08:30	<moosejaw>	now instead of ripping on me, can i fix it?
08:30	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: If it's really shot, try editing fstab from a liveCD
08:30	<FernLujan>	crdbl: do I do a reboot now?
08:30	<crdlb>	FernLujan, no it should apply instantly
08:30	<what_if>	does the server install cd support "seeding"
08:31	<r_rehashed>	my MD5 checksum didn't match for Feisty! :(
08:31	<FernLujan>	crdbl: it's not working
08:31	<moosejaw>	k...and thats just by booting with a copy of ubuntu?
08:31	<crdlb>	FernLujan, are you using metacity?
08:31	<Crazytom>	moosejaw, yeah
08:31	<moosejaw>	thanks.
08:31	<crdlb>	FernLujan, ie not compiz or beryl
08:31	<FernLujan>	crdbl: ah, yes, nvm. just a stupid mistake
08:31	<moosejaw>	i was going to try that next...was hoping i could do something else
08:31	<r_rehashed>	have to download the whole image now and wait.. painful!
08:31	<FernLujan>	crdbl: no, I just didn't press enter after I typed F2 :P
08:32	<what_if>	Has anyone here ever "seeded" an install disk ??
08:32	<Kix>	what_if: ? Torrent?
08:32	<compwiz18>	can anyone help me with my ATI drivers on Feisty?  They don't seem to work properly...
08:32	<what_if>	Kix: no, automated install
08:32	<switchy>	hi all, does anyone have any ideas why Feisty does not automatically recognize my Sony Ericsson w810i as Edgy did?
08:32	<tehseen>	can someone msg me if they know how to setup smartphone on linux
08:33	<FernLujan>	crdbl: thanks for your help :)
08:33	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, nvidia installer didn't work.. so i tried to install the restricted modules again, but this time i disabled "nv" in the /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules file as specified on one of the ubuntu forums
08:33	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, and now i'm getting the nvidia.ko error... and that it can't load glx
08:34	<Possum>	should I use apt-get or aptitude to install things?
08:34	<_3uG_>	aptitude
08:34	<what_if>	Possum: does not matter, preference
08:34	<crdlb>	Possum, aptitude is better, but it really doesn't matter
08:34	<_3uG_>	it's smarter with dependencies, supposedly
08:34	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: hm... tried removing nvidia-kernel-common and nvidia-glx then running the nvidia installer with the --uninstall option, then restart computer and reinstall nvidia again?
08:35	<Possum>	Yea, that's what I've heard from the debian crew
08:35	<Robbie_Crash>	my nvidia kernel module and my nvidia driver have different versions. The driver is the latest driver, and the kernel version is the second most recent. I want to keep the latest driver, how can I fix this situation?
08:35	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, yup, tried that. =-(
08:35	<_3uG_>	wow, look at that. robbie has the same problem
08:35	<smt6k>	anyone know why gksu might not prompt me for a password the first time?
08:35	<Possum>	synaptic uses apt-get? or aptitude? (or a common backend to both?)
08:36	<smt6k>	apt-get probably..
08:36	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, current error msg:    Failed to initialize the GLX module; please check in your X
08:36	<infidel>	!upgrade
08:36	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
08:36	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: I'm out of ideas =/ I'd say use envy to uninstall everything nvidia-related, remove linux-restricted-modules, restart comp and try installing the nvidia driver... that's what I did anyways =/ other than that, I have no idea :(
08:36	<Possum>	smt6k, heh, I'm more comfortable in the command line anyway...
08:36	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: oh WAIT
08:36	<smt6k>	:D
08:37	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, ...yeah?!?!
08:37	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: try "sudo rmmod nvidia"
08:37	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: then run the nvidia installer again
08:37	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: that should do it ^^
08:37	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, oh geez... obvious solution
08:37	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, brb, trying that
08:37	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: it took about 30 mins of my time, couldn't forget it ;)
08:38	<Robbie_Crash>	I cannot start x because my nvidia kernel module and my nvidia driver have different versions. The driver is the latest driver, and the kernel version is the second most recent. I want to keep the latest driver, how can I fix this situation?
08:38	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, i've been fighting this since about a week before feisty final was released (and my controller still won't work with my gameport)
08:38	<BaACkUp>	lag lag lag
08:38	<BaACkUp>	!Ping me
08:38	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ping me - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
=== haru is now known as DaMi3n
08:38	<tuskernini>	!ping
08:38	<ubotu>	pong
08:39	<_3uG_>	Robbie_Crash, i'm working on the same thing right now... it looks like the best solution is to remove everything nvidia-related and linux-restricted-modules and then reboot and use the nvidia installer.. but be sure to do sudo rmmod nvidia first
08:39	<DaMi3n>	can someone please tell me how do i enter a mountpoint with a space in dir name in fstab??
08:39	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: hm, I dunno about controllers in gameports (except a PSX pad with the LPT1 port :P) so someone else could help you with that ^^
08:39	<Centaur5>	Can anybody tell me if Kickstart allows you to leave certain things unanswered so it will ask when you're doing an installation?
08:39	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, probably\ like\ this
08:39	<liquiddoom>	DARKGuy: /Like\ This/
08:39	<liquiddoom>	erm
08:39	<liquiddoom>	Wrong person, lol
08:39	<DARKGuy>	liquiddoom: o.O
08:39	<nemo_home>	Hey. I have a moderately complex 7.04 upgrade issue.
08:39	<DARKGuy>	liquiddoom: lol, that's ok :P
08:40	<Robbie_Crash>	_3ug_ The nvidia installer from nvidia.com or the nvidia installer in synaptic?
08:40	<DaMi3n>	zcat[1] , o tried /dev/sdb2    "/media/Mai\ Moosik"     ntfs-3g     defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
08:40	<DaMi3n>	both with and without quotes
08:40	<fiction>	Hey guys. I unchecked some boxes at System ->	administrator ->	services and now ubuntu wonm't start
08:40	<DaMi3n>	they dont work :(
08:40	<fiction>	any thoughts?
08:40	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, quotes or \, not both, I suspect
08:40	<Robbie_Crash>	fiction what services?
08:40	<nemo_home>	My mom's boyfriend switched off (powered off) her laptop while I was installing some stuff on it once. this damaged portions of ubuntu package manager, after some struggling I got it almost back to normal 'cept it had no clue what packages were already installed...
08:41	<nemo_home>	The 7.04 update, as a result, failed with error that it had no idea what desktop was installed.
08:41	<acidtabs>	Has anyone have installed urban terror that would help me to install
08:41	<nemo_home>	I went ahead and "reinstalled" ubuntu-desktop and all its dependancies, but now the 7.04 upgrade button no longer appears
08:41	<fiction>	Robbie_Crash: if i remember correctly: both actions schedulers, bluetooth device management, cpu frequency manager, computer activity logger
08:41	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop for starters?
08:41	<nemo_home>	I'd like to know what flag it is checking
08:41	<DaMi3n>	zcat[1] , /dev/sdb2    /media/Mai\ Moosik     ntfs-3g     defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
08:41	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: done :-p
08:41	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: sorry man, one more thing. HOw do you execute multiple command lines in that one value box?
08:41	<DaMi3n>	that doesnt work either
08:41	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: see above :)
08:42	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: is there a special character for a new space?
08:42	<Shadow_X>	would it be totally foolish to install everything from synaptic?
08:42	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: I'd like to avoid a manual 7.04 update, I'd like to know how to get the pretty lil' upgrade tool back
08:42	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, I think that should work..
08:42	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: Are you using the feisty repos?
08:42	<zcat[1] >	DaMi3n, what's the error?
08:43	<DaMi3n>	zcat[1] , /dev/sdb2    /media/Mai\ Moosik     ntfs-3g     defaults,locale=en_US.utf8   0    0
08:43	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: at the moment. probably not? it halted in the middle of upgrading, as stated. aborted on figuring out what it needed to do.
08:43	<DaMi3n>	zcat[1] , [mntent] : line 16 in /etc/fstab is bad
08:43	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: one sec. can check though
08:43	<acidtabs>	 Has anyone installed urban terror that would help me to install
08:43	<fiction>	rofl acidtabs
08:43	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: It might not want to start again if it went to the feisty repos, not too sure though
08:43	<fiction>	fun name
08:43	<acidtabs>	??
08:43	<endlessurf>	hey out there i lost sound when i updated to feisty, my card is a Intel Corporation 82801G and i was wondering if anyone else has had this problem or knows of a fix
08:43	<acidtabs>	oh
08:43	<liquiddoom>	dist-upgrades are tricky little things...
08:43	<fiction>	i like the name XD
08:44	<Robbie_Crash>	!blacklist
08:44	<ubotu>	To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add  blacklist <modulename>	 to the end of that list - To explicitly load modules in a specific order, list them in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and type  sudo update-initramfs -u 
08:44	<fiction>	Robbie_Crash: is that to me?
08:44	<Shadow_X>	would it be totally foolish to install everything from synaptic?
08:44	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: memory jogger on where those are?
08:45	<Robbie_Crash>	no, that's to me I've got a pesky module that's giving me errors every four minutes
08:45	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: am not an ubuntu person normally, and haven't had to mess with it in months
08:45	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: /etc/apt/sources.list/
08:45	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, i tried using \
08:45	<Robbie_Crash>	fiction I don't know how to help you
08:45	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, didnt work :( says [mntent] : line 16 in /etc/fstab is bad
08:45	<fiction>	Robbie_Crash: alright. ill ask again
08:45	<kkathman>	!w32codecs
08:45	<ubotu>	Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages, including the win32 codecs: see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - See also !Codecs
08:45	<fiction>	Hey guys. I unchecked some boxes at System ->	administrator ->	services and now ubuntu wonm't start
08:45	<kkathman>	!wmv
08:45	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
08:45	<liquiddoom>	DaMi3n: Odd. If all else fails, make it an underscore or something
08:46	<liquiddoom>	DaMi3n: If you can, that is
08:46	<FernLuja1>	I Have a question on keybinding. In gconf-editor, when you're making a command, in the value textbox, how do you make multiple commands. Is there a character I should input that acts as a new line?
08:46	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, last resorts :'(
08:46	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: sources are still edgy - mod timestamp of today, and some files in /etc/apt that look like leftovers from the aborted upgrade
08:46	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: probably reverted when it aborted
08:46	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, however ubvuntu does by default mount it to a directory named /Mai\ Moosik
08:47	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, you want a single keypress to run multiple commands?
08:47	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: yeah
08:47	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: like update the desktop images before getting to the desktop cube
08:47	<liquiddoom>	DaMi3n: I'm not too sure what to do about that oddness
08:47	<switchy>	Has anyone else's system stopped auto recognizing certain USB connections after ungrading to Feisty?
08:47	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home
08:47	<liquiddoom>	whoops
08:47	<Shadow_X>	would it be totally foolish to install everything from synaptic?
08:47	<liquiddoom>	Meant to press shift, not enter..
08:48	<kkathman>	what is the repository for w32codecs?
08:48	<T0uCH>	hi.. i am lookin for someone who can help me with the installation of the nvidia driver in ubuntu 7.04.  I have been askin for help here since 4 days and nobody who tried, has solve the problem... please someone?
08:48	<zeroday>	shadow_x: y not?
08:48	<Wicked>	Hey guys, I have a tiny little problem, my laptop battery died while about 90% in the upgrade. What would be mybest course of action to recover whatever I can?
08:48	<Robbie_Crash>	T0uCH what's the problem?
08:48	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, you could write a script then put that script in the value box
08:48	<zeroday>	Touch: Whats the issue
08:48	<haru>	liquiddoom, thank you
08:48	<liquiddoom>	kkathman: PLF (deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ feisty free non-free
08:48	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: how do I write a script?
08:48	<Burgundavia>	T0uCH: have you follwed the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
08:48	<zcat[1] >	T0uCH, I just went into restricted drivers manager and checked the box.... now it works
08:48	<kkathman>	liquiddoom,  thanks :)
08:49	<Wicked>	Anyone?
08:49	<Wicked>	I can only boot into busybox =\
08:49	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: tired and time for bed. will poke at this tomorrow. any idea what might trigger the restart though?
08:49	<T0uCH>	Robbie_Crash:  everytime i try to enable 3d  and install nvidia ( and i have done everything whos on these help pages) the x session failed and i can only access in safe mode
08:49	<ice_nine>	howdy, when using bittornado and I change preferences then restart the program the preferences get reset to default. Any idea why?
08:49	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: I'm not too sure
08:49	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, just create a text file in /usr/bin and put on the first line #!/bin/bash
08:49	<liquiddoom>	nemo_home: I'll try to help out further tomorrow
08:49	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, on the next two lines, put what you want to run
08:50	<moosejaw>	how do i use live cd to fix fstab??? how do i get to the file?
08:50	<T0uCH>	i check the box... download an d try all the drivers
08:50	<zeroday>	Touch do you hav an intergrated graphics card?
08:50	<jpjacobs>	FernLuja1,  this is a nice guid  tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
08:50	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Mount your root dir first
08:50	<chowmeined>	Robbie_Crash: hmm, Actually deluge is looking good.. its fairly simple, uses PyGTK, at first it kind of appears to be missing features (but Azureus is so big in that way).. but it manages multiple torrents, it even has a cool scheduling plugin (you can set certain times of day/week to have the bandwidth up/down be limited)
08:50	<T0uCH>	i got a e-geforce 6200 le
08:50	<nemo_home>	liquiddoom: thanks. g'nite. silly installer shouldn't leave itself in an unreturnable state. but then. if he hadn't damaged the filesystem all those months ago..
08:50	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Try fdisk -l /dev/hda
08:50	<zcat[1] >	T0uCH, download what? I _only_ checked the box, then restarted...
08:50	<Robbie_Crash>	T0uCH what does x say when it fails?
08:50	<Frogzoo>	so how stable is feisty? any big issues in the upgrade?
08:50	<jpjacobs>	moosejaw, boot the livecd, open the etc/fstab (on the HD) and edit it...
08:50	<Frogzoo>	so how stable is feisty? any big issues in the upgrade?
08:50	<endlessurf>	i lost my sound :(..
08:51	<FernLuja1>	crdbl, jpjacobs: thanks guys
08:51	<moosejaw>	how do i get to my HD?
08:51	<zcat[1] >	that's what feisty is all about; you shouldn't have to mess with binary drivers and config files.
08:51	<moosejaw>	thats what i am asking
08:51	<zeroday>	endlessdurf: Do you have a toshiba?
08:51	<Wicked>	Could I possibly mount the harddrive and upgrade it through the live CD?
08:51	<T0uCH>	i got it in french but looks like that :  unable to load x session... bad configuration
08:51	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: do I Need to make the file a specific format?
08:51	<Robbie_Crash>	chowmeined thanks, I'll look at it after I get my things working
08:51	<zeroday>	touch: try dpkg-reconfgure xserver-xorg
08:51	<endlessurf>	naw compaq
08:51	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: You need to mount your hard drive to edit files on it.
08:52	<endlessurf>	Intel 82801G audio
08:52	<endlessurf>	is the card
08:52	<kkathman>	liquiddoom,  are you sure ?? I added, updated but search cant find w32codecs
08:52	<moosejaw>	ok
08:52	<zeroday>	endlesssurf: Do you have the debian menu installed?
08:52	<T0uCH>	i had try this yesterday but i'll try it again
08:52	<fiction>	Hey guys. I unchecked some boxes at System ->	administrator ->	services and now ubuntu wonm't start. any thoughts?
08:52	<liquiddoom>	kkathman: I'll check the repo
08:52	<Robbie_Crash>	After blacklisting a module, do I need to reboot, or restart x or should the errors just stop?
08:52	<kkathman>	ok thanx
08:52	<endlessurf>	what ever comes with the feisty fawn install iso
08:52	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, just a plain text file, make sure you make it executable
08:52	<skullhead>	any one know of ay programs to make your taskbar look cool?
08:52	<endlessurf>	I just did a fresh install yesterday though
08:53	<kkathman>	I know seveas had one in Dapper and Edgy I thought...didnt know if he did for Feisty tho
08:53	<Bennedetto>	hello everyone, quick question (and i know that there is a kubuntu channel, just not getting an answer there) I would like to enable compiz (not beryl) in kubuntu feist... is it possible to do this through a settings manager of some sort, or does it not come on the default install of kubuntu?
08:53	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: how do I Make it executable???
08:53	<zeroday>	endlesssurf: I had this issue to and it is because your PCM volume levels are muted
08:53	<moosejaw>	liquiddoom so i want to mount sda1 what is that command?
08:53	<KarlosII>	is there a script or program in ubuntu that would redetect video settings and reqrite the configuration file?
08:53	<FernLuja1>	crdbl: the #!/bin/bash ???
08:53	<Wicked>	Anyway to upgrade a current system to feisty using the liveCD?
08:53	<endlessurf>	where do i go and fix the setting
08:53	<zilly6_>	wicked, not that i know of
08:53	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: sudo mount /dev/sda1 (mount point)
08:53	<crdlb>	FernLuja1, sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/scriptname
08:53	<KarlosII>	kkathman: hmm
08:53	<zeroday>	endlesssurf: However i had Debian Menu whcih had a volume controller in it that could change the PCM levels
08:53	<skullhead>	is any one else geting slow package downloading?
08:53	<Wicked>	zilly6_, any other way of upgrading my system?
08:53	<jpjacobs>	FernLuja1, execute it like bash <script>
08:54	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, it was a no-go. same problem. rmmod did nothing ("module not loaded" or similar)
08:54	<crdlb>	that work too
08:54	<zilly6_>	does anyone know how to include a file in c using gcc?
08:54	<crdlb>	works*
08:54	<T0uCH>	someone can help me in private there is too many people here
08:54	<liquiddoom>	kkathman: You might need the deb-src line
08:54	<FernLuja1>	thanks
08:54	<zilly6_>	wicked, alternative distro
08:54	<zcat[1] >	Wicked, update-manager with some switch '-c' iirc but I'd have to check
08:54	<moosejaw>	liquiddoom what should the mountpoint be?
08:54	<endlessurf>	oh man i feel so stupid now
08:54	<kkathman>	liquiddoom,  or maybe a key?
08:54	<_3uG_>	does anyone know of a good 3d card that has (good) open drivers? i believe that i'm sick of dealing with nvidia's closed drivers
08:54	<Shadow_X>	anyone have any idea how long it'll take synaptic to select all packages for installation?
08:54	<skullhead>	any one else having slow package downloading?
08:54	<jpjacobs>	moosejaw, doesn't matter
08:54	<liquiddoom>	kkathman: Right! Lemme get the command for that
08:54	<endlessurf>	i pulled up my audio menu and there was a little mute icon on pcm2
08:55	<zcat[1] >	Wicked, "sudo update-manager -c"
08:55	<Shadow_X>	skullhead: depends on the server load atm
08:55	<endlessurf>	now it works
08:55	<endlessurf>	thanks zero
08:55	<zilly6_>	wicked my update manager is telling me i can upgrade the distro
08:55	<KarlosII>	Is there a script or program in ubuntu that would redetect video settings and rewrite the configuration file for xorf.conf?
08:55	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Depends. Try sudo mkdir /media/hda1 and mount there?
08:55	<zeroday>	np
08:55	<crdlb>	_3uG_, the only non-integrated card with a free driver, is an old ati radeon
08:55	<Wicked>	zilly6_, it's not that
08:55	<Shadow_X>	ubotu Xorg
08:55	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Or sda1
08:55	<ubotu>	The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
08:55	<T0uCH>	after i have done this : dpkg-reconfgure xserver-xorg    what should i do?
08:55	<Wicked>	It's that during the upgrade, my laptop battery failed me
08:55	<kkathman>	liquiddoom,  yah the one I got from a web site returns that its not valud
08:55	<kkathman>	valid
08:55	<_3uG_>	crdlb, darn.. that's probably too old to be worth anything these days. thanks, though
08:55	<zeroday>	Touch: How are you installing the nvidia drivers?

08:56	<zilly6_>	wicked someone here helped me fix a broken install/upgrade
08:56	<DShepherd>	T0uCH, do you have a nvidia card?
08:56	<ice_nine>	is someone able to help me with bittornado?
08:56	<moosejaw>	liquiddoom i cant get it to mount
08:56	<FernLuja1>	thanks
08:56	<T0uCH>	yes i do
08:56	<zilly6_>	does anyone know how to include a file in C?
08:56	<jpjacobs>	FernLuja1, you don't create programs in the bin folder. if you install something locally it should go to /usr/local/bin
08:56	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Any errors?
08:56	<zcat[1] >	DShepherd, rofl.. obvious things first :)

08:57	<ice_nine>	zilly6: isn't it: #include <fileheadername.h>
08:57	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Oh... did I give you the mount command backwards?
08:57	<DShepherd>	T0uCH, kool
08:57	<DaMi3n>	liquiddoom, found a way to use spaces :) have to use \040 instead of "\ "
08:58	<jpjacobs>	FernLuja1, i know, but it should go in /usr
08:58	<ice_nine>	zilly6: wait I'm thinking library
08:58	<jpjacobs>	 /local/bin
08:58	<infidel>	DShepherd, i mean not burning the image to disk but just using the iso file

08:59	<zeroday>	woops my bad infidel
08:59	<Meshezabeel>	heya have an ati card, I used to be able to watch my display output on my tv, but now I can't, any ideas what I need to change, or at the very least can you tell me what video I have to edit again? I edited it once with 6.10, but 7.04 must've took out settings.
08:59	<Robbie_Crash>	I cannot start x because my nvidia kernel module and my nvidia driver have different versions. The driver is the latest driver, and the kernel version is the second most recent. I want to keep the latest driver, how can I fix this situation?

09:00	<blazemonger>	God  my first week being on a PC has been the most horrible experience
09:00	<blazemonger>	there's not one piece of midi software that will work'
09:00	<moosejaw>	liquiddoom thank you
09:00	<moosejaw>	i fixed it
09:00	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: however, I bet you won't have any better luck with ATI, if not worse :
09:00	<DARKGuy>	:/
09:00	<blazemonger>	midi sequencing (i have a few synths i want to use rosegarden with)
09:00	<liquiddoom>	moosejaw: Awesome.
09:00	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, i tried that (twice) and it didn't work.. i have no idea what's wrong, but this is been really ...stupid. thanks again for your help, though. we need to pressure nvidia =-)
09:01	<se2131>	xtknight: so my computer froze again (after much longer this time for some reason)
09:01	<moosejaw>	k bbiab
09:01	<se2131>	xtknight: I tried the Alt-PrtScr-K thing you told me to do
09:01	<se2131>	xtknight: but it froze everything and I could not get to a text terminal
09:01	<Meshezabeel>	looks like my settings are still in xorg.conf to display my tv, but all I'm getting is wavy lines, any idea what changed in 7.04 and how to fix it so it works like it used to in 6.10?
09:01	<Robbie_Crash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
09:02	<se2131>	xtknight: so I couldn't save the dmesg info to a file to show you
09:02	<switchy>	Hi all, Edgy used to recognize my phone immediately, but Feisty doesn't, does anyone have any idea what might be wrong?
09:02	<Shadow_X>	anyone have any idea how long it'll take synaptic to select all packages for installation?
09:02	<DShepherd>	Robbie_Crash, apt-cache policy nvidia-kernel-common gives you want?
09:03	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: yeah... good luck solving your problem!
09:03	<T0uCH>	it doesn't work.... when i restart the x session it never work ...
09:03	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, so i figured out the problem. there are some extra things that you need to do for my card (geforce4 mx 440)
09:04	<T0uCH>	i need to do this : sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg to come back in
09:04	<T0uCH>	everytime
09:05	<DARKGuy>	_3uG_: oh, forgot that small detail :P what was it?
=== DLB|Maxim is now known as DLB|Maximus
09:05	<Ademan>	anyone know if a samba transfer will let me know if some data is incomplete or corrupt?
09:05	<_3uG_>	have to add Option "ModeValidation" "DFP-0: NoEdidDFPMaxSizeCheck, NoVesaModes" and Option "ExactModeTimingsDVI" "TRUE" to xorg.conf
09:05	<Robbie_Crash>	DShepherd it all matches up in there, I think that it fixed itself after a full reboot, rather than just restarting x, because my x now starts up fine and I can get my glxinfo out of it
09:05	<Robbie_Crash>	However this ssh issue is still killing me :/

09:06	<FernLuja1>	IS there any app like 3ddesktop, but that is realtime instead of taking screenshots?

09:07	<lizor1>	Robbie_Crash: ssh issue? what is happening?
09:07	<_3uG_>	DARKGuy, not sure yet, but that's what i've just read.. but it's a huge "you must do this if you have this card" type thing

09:12	<T0uCH>	no
09:12	<dj-fu>	Ademan: md5sum
09:12	<zeroday>	can u display your xorg file
09:12	<dj-fu>	Ademan: provides 'sum', which is what you want
09:13	<Ademan>	dj-fu: yeah i just realized i worded that incredibly poorly, i meant something that would go into a directory and remove duplicate files
09:13	<dj-fu>	bash, and sum.
09:13	<T0uCH>	sure.. /usr/???
09:13	<zeroday>	etc/X11/xorg

09:17	<kadakas>	I did not find a file browsing feature in MultiSync
09:17	<aaron>	sorry, just asked a couple times, anyway, I'm having issues with my ralink card and wpa
09:17	<aaron>	feisty seems to autodetect the card, but wpa is not enabled
09:17	<micahcowan>	zilly6_, all the basic ones, yes. For libraries other than, say, libc, you may need to install the "-dev" version of them. (for instance, if you have "libsdl" installed and want to install the headers, you need "libsdl-dev"
09:17	<zeroday>	does fiesty detect your ralink card fine
09:18	<aaron>	however, when I change the router to wep encryption it still doesn't connect
09:18	<zilly6_>	micahcowan but things like stdio and math.h, i should be cool?
09:18	<Ademan>	uh, so samba seems to be having MAJOR trouble with directory names with spaces in them, is there any way around this?
09:18	<aaron>	it's odd, because network-manager seems to see the available networks
09:18	<micahcowan>	zilly6_, yes. It may not install the docs (manpages for those functions) and such, though.
09:18	<aaron>	and knows their encryption type
09:18	<CapaH>	zeroday: Hmm, I checked and PCM not muted, nothing muted --- but the sound itself acts as though it was muted -- ideas?
09:18	<zeroday>	aaron: What to you put under encrytion 64 bit hexxxxxxxx 64 bit acsii or 123bit
09:19	<Meshezabeel>	is it possible that the upgrade to feisty deleted my ati drivers that I installed for tv out?
09:19	<aaron>	128bit, and I tried passphrase and hex
09:19	<zeroday>	capah: bring everything to the maz
09:19	<aaron>	for wep that is
09:19	<micahcowan>	zilly6_, you can install manpages-dev to get some of those.
09:19	<aaron>	wpa gives a warning saying it isn't supported
09:19	<zilly6_>	thanks a lot micahcowan, you've been a great help

09:23	<MoxJet>	when you aren't running X and just see the coomand line
09:23	<micahcowan>	BlueStorm, why? You just search for the program you want, select and install it.

09:23	<makuseru>	tuskernini: there not videos, just flash animations
09:23	<MoxJet>	in dos you could change it to 80x50, how would one do it in linux?
09:23	<BlueStorm>	micahcowan, notebook, touchpad

09:24	<zeroday>	touch: First install nvidai-glx
09:24	<micahcowan>	MoxJet, you need to add the "vga=ask" option to the end of your kernel parameters next time you boot. Then when you've found the option you like, you can add vga=n, permanently, in your /boot/grub/menu.lst (where n is the number of the option you want)
09:24	<Helmi>	tuskernini: i added the notification area now but it's just an empty area - do i have to setup anything else?

09:28	<micahcowan>	BlueStorm, I'm sorry, I couldn't understand that.
09:28	<BlueStorm>	micahcowan, me neither

09:29	<kosnick>	how can i make gnome netstatus show traffic like it used to back in dapper?

09:30	<Jordan_U>	BlueEagle, You shouldn't see your password when you enter it if that is what you mean
09:30	<CapaH>	I did alsa-utils restart and no difference... hmm
09:30	<Lamego>	df
09:30	<micahcowan>	arooni, perhaps update-alternatives --display java
09:30	<sanityx>	The solution is sudo fluxcapacitor --fix
09:30	<Lamego>	it will show you one of your filesystems is fulll
09:30	<Possum>	last time I used it, it was during the compiz days
09:30	<DShepherd>	zeroday, T0uCH's xorg.conf says that his card is Generic...

09:31	<_ringo_>	hey, does anyone know what vmware-kernel-modules does exactly?
09:31	<zeroday>	Touch: soz 6200
09:31	<T0uCH>	the problem is the card?
09:31	<DShepherd>	zeroday, ok.. carry on
09:31	<kosnick>	does anyone use gnome netstatus? is it working properly? shows the traffic ?
09:31	<DShepherd>	:-)
09:31	<ElllisD>	Lamego: /dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root is 100%
09:31	<zeroday>	dshepard: i might be wrong but i had serious issues with my 5500
09:32	<Jordan_U>	DShepherd, That is normal, the label does nothing, it's just there so you can put the name of your card for referene
09:32	<zeroday>	touch: have you changed the driver?
09:32	<Jordan_U>	*reference
09:32	<micahcowan>	kosnick, I'm not really familiar with it, how do you open it?

09:33	<zeroday>	touch: no soz you need to change the row Driver "vesa" to Driver "nvidia"
09:33	<mjc>	blazemonger: pro tools :p
09:33	<micahcowan>	BlueStorm, a tar.gz is usually source code, that needs compiling. If you at all can, you should really prefer to use the packaging system (Synaptic, or apt-get). If it absolutely doesn't exist in package-form, then you'd need to install software necessary for compiling it. But then there's nothing to track dependencies or remove it later if needed.
09:33	<fluid>	nevermind, i got it :D
09:34	<magnetron>	hi, how do i make a package request?
09:34	<T0uCH>	zeroday:  ok its done.. save?

09:40	<mjc>	kantor: you don't
09:40	<kantor>	magnetron, I have discovered a "bug" in the new debian etch related to the adjustment of the mtu value
09:40	<mjc>	blazemonger: no, XP or OSX

10:05	<clearzen>	sudo aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` would get it working more than likely. To find what kernel you are running type uname -r in the terminal and then download the corresponding linux-restricted-modules package if it is a atheros card.

10:13	<Crazytom>	NemesisD, did you use sudo?
10:13	<Andruk>	Hugo: If you are going to have less than 4 partitions on it, then primary.  if greater than 4 partitions, extended, and a logical inside of that

10:20	<Crazytom>	NemesisD, go back to #ndiswrapper seeing as how now you have the newest version installed

10:21	<Hobbsee>	Seveas: heya!
10:21	<Amon-san>	i'm really puzzled what caused the entries in grub to become faulty

10:22	<Draconicus>	I've been digging around all over the place, in bug reports, updates, and so forth. This needs an in depth analysis from somebody who actually knows what the hell they're talking about.
10:22	<Danltn>	Could someone explain to me the workaround for this error? Link: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18

10:23	<Bogaurd>	magnetron: awesome! thanks :)
10:23	<eck>	Danltn: it means your bios is really old, and you need /boot at the beginning of the drive
10:23	<NemesisD>	how do i install kernelheaders and kernelsources from the feisty cd?
10:23	<Danltn>	I know, but I'm not very competent, what changes should I make?
10:23	<Draconicus>	My client QUIT because I couldn't respond quick enough. Damnit... damnit damnit damnit. It's four thirty in the morning. I've been up all night trying to figure this out. Doesn't ANYONE know about webcams?! They're kind of important for conferences!
10:23	<eck>	Danltn: run: disk -l /dev/sda (or whatever your hdd is)
10:23	<magnetron>	Bogaurd: it was in the guide, you should have read it
10:23	<eck>	err, fdisk
10:23	<papatwilight>	never mind its working
10:23	<Seveas>	Draconicus, here's a tip: switch of your pc, grab something to drink, walk around the block to calm down and then come back
10:23	<BlueStorm>	clearzen, error while loading shared libraries: libvorbisfile.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

10:24	<Draconicus>	Seveas: Four in the morning.
10:24	<Seveas>	Draconicus, you're too frustrated now to behave and nobody will feel like helping
10:24	<Bogaurd>	let me have a look again
10:24	<KrakensDen>	Draconicus, nope
10:24	<Seveas>	Draconicus, refreshing :)
10:24	<eck>	Danltn: that will let you see where the cylinder boundaries are you so you how early it needs to be on the drive
10:24	<Draconicus>	Seveas: Sleep is preferable, and now it's too late for help anyway. Goodnight.
10:24	<Bogaurd>	magnetron: oh. my fault. sorry :)
10:24	<eck>	Danltn: then you need to use gparted or something like that to create a partition near the front... you can just create one ~30 MB or so, since /boot should be pretty tiny
10:24	<magnetron>	Bogaurd: np
10:25	<Seveas>	Draconicus, good night!
10:25	<sacater>	Seveas: morning technically :P

10:26	<fortitUs>	help? :(
10:26	<Jordan_U>	Danltn, Or has GRUB never worked on this machine? Also have you changed hardware at all recently?
10:26	<sacater>	fortitUs: strange permissions, it should let you do that :o
10:26	<velko>	fortitUs, the correct format is "ls -s source dest"

10:51	<afflux>	how can I install the eclipse-platform package without installing java-gcj-compat? (in the depends it says: java-gcj-compat | java1-runtime | java2-runtime, I have sun-java6-jre installed which provides java2-runtime)
10:51	<T0uCH>	is there somebody who can tell me which graphic card is the most easy to install under ubuntu?
10:51	<andrewsg>	Is there any way to run the Ubuntu Migration Assistant after installation?
10:51	<andrewsg>	For some reason the UMA didn't detect my windows partition when I installed, so I'd like to try and run it now
10:51	<clearzen>	DaMi3n: I would say find a different proxy. I don't know the wget command for that repo off the top of my head.
10:51	<liquiddoom>	andrewsg: sudo apt-get install ubiquity?
10:51	<nibsa1242b>	During upgrade from edgy to Feisty there was an error processing konq-kim, and the update manager said my system might be in an unusable state and to run dpkg --configure -a that said that something wasn't allowed and the script returned error exit status 2... will things be ok on reboot or am I going to have a 2nd trashed system that fails to boot?
10:52	<DaMi3n>	clearzen, thank you :)
10:52	<fiery_cleric>	afflux: but if it depends on it ... it DEPENDS on it .... thats the whole point ?
10:52	<andrewsg>	What's ubiquity?  Is that just another name for the UMA program?
10:52	<liquiddoom>	andrewsg: It's the installer
10:52	<orbin>	anyone willing to give me a hand with ndiswrapper?  i think i've got all my settings right, but i can't seem to connect via nm-applet - it just spins.  details: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16990/

10:55	<velko>	nibsa1242b, you do realize that if you don't post the error message nobody can guess what the error message means, yes?
10:55	<apollo13>	hi, htpasswd2 command not found, where can I find it (which package..., using feisty)
10:55	<nibsa1242b>	velko it says subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2 and then Errors were encountered while processing: konq-kim. I tried apt-get remove konq-kim but that failed

10:57	<nibsa1242b>	velko apt-get remove konq-kim failed with "No diversion 'any diversion of /usr/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/imageconverter.desktop', none removed" and the same message for /usr/..../jpegorient.desktop
10:57	<Choinix>	Hello :)
10:57	<nibsa1242b>	velko I'm thinking apt-get remove konqueror ?
10:57	<velko>	nibsa1242b, do you have imagemagick and konqueror installed?
10:58	<velko>	nibsa1242b, don't do it. this is the default web browser and file manager in kde
10:58	<El_Burro>	is there a command to compare two files to see if they are the same?
10:58	<tarzeau>	El_Burro: diff file1 file2
10:58	<El_Burro>	cool, cheers
10:58	<fiery_cleric>	El_Burro: diff --brief
10:58	<nibsa1242b>	I don't have kde installed anyway... just gnome
10:59	<velko>	nibsa1242b, then you can remove konqueror and konq-kim
10:59	<FreeSoul>	hi guys. I'm running ubuntu 7.4 desktop and i need sshd. Is there any way to install it as binary ??????
10:59	<alesdoc>	Hi how can i remove with a console deskbar applet from the panel?
10:59	<nibsa1242b>	velko thanks
10:59	<velko>	FreeSoul, sudo aptitude install openssh-server
10:59	<ExpositionOfEvil>	hello
10:59	<stoiko>	hi guys. im running ubuntu edgy and i want to move to feisty. however the updater says that i don thave enough space on /boot. my boot partition is currently 32mb. is this enough for feisty?
11:00	<FreeSoul>	velko, i did sudo apt-get install openssh-server but it wont find any package to install
11:00	<tarzeau>	stoiko: you need to remove some old kernels maybe?
11:00	<kritzstapf>	FreeSoul, apt-get install ssh
11:00	<velko>	FreeSoul, apt-cache search openssh
11:00	<Helmi>	ok smbfs is installed - do i have to mount the shares via fstab then or is there a possibility to have them mounted via nautilus and have them accessible via the shell?=
11:01	<liquiddoom>	Does anyone know if you can get duplicity to behave with scp? With ftp, you can set FTP_PASSWORD, but there's no SCP_PASSWORD variable to set
11:01	<ExpositionOfEvil>	what if I lose internet connection from my router, which is right next to me?  I think its from interference from other people in my area.  What should I do?
11:01	<liquiddoom>	Otherwise, it prompts for a password every time it transfers a file
11:02	<gooblin>	Does Azureus cycle through trackers like utorrent?
11:02	<fiery_cleric>	Helmi: AFAIK nautilus cant mount smbfs ... but u might be able to write a nautilus-script to do it other wise from the sell its ... mount -t smbfs //computer_name/share /mountpoint
11:02	<chowmeined>	Azureus is failling badly
11:02	<nibsa1242b>	velko, ok now what do I just restart the system, or because the upgrade manager stopped because of the error do I have to re upgrade to feisty?
11:02	<Helmi>	fiery_cleric, thanks
11:03	<fortitUs>	hey whats the command to show all the processes
11:03	<fortitUs>	and their cpu usuge?
11:03	<fortitUs>	usage*
11:03	<gooblin>	Does Azureus cycle through trackers like utorrent?
11:03	<frolle>	I need help with dm-crypt. I am follwing a howto, but i am stuck
11:03	<velko>	nibsa1242b, what happens when you run the command you were supposed to run at the beginning? does it spits any error messages?
11:03	<Draconicus>	Ggrr... can't sleep. Ended up getting out of bed because Camorama bugged me so much (I have OCD. Bear with me, please). Camorama seems to be missing its effects filters. Does anyone know why? I look blue and purple on the screen because it doesn't have the color correction. x_x
11:03	<chowmeined>	frolle: I can help you what are you having a problem with?
11:04	<liquiddoom>	On the topic of SMB, one of my shares set to and mounted as rw only lets me write as root
11:04	<nbjayme>	hello all.  is there a backport to dapper for opengl version 1.3?
11:04	<cheeko>	so what is the easiest way to upgrade to ubuntu 7.04 without losing my configs/settings/files? when i download the iso and boot the CD is there an installation option to retain my data and just update the ubuntu+kernel?
11:04	<ExpositionOfEvil>	what if I lose internet connection from my router, which is right next to me?  I think its from interference from other people in my area.  What should I do?
11:04	<frolle>	chowmeined: sounds great! I have installed cryptsetup hashalot..
11:04	<liquiddoom>	When I try to mount it as a normal user, smbmount doesn't work
11:04	<nibsa1242b>	velko now that konq is uninstalled it doesn't say anything just returns me to $ after a second
11:05	<FreeSoul>	using apititude install openssh-server is says: no candidate version found for openssh-server. No packages will be installed
11:05	<frolle>	Then i dont know about my kernel, because i cant find the device: dev/mapper/control
11:05	<SarahDavies>	hi, I'm a new user, trying to install for the first time on a macbook, but I'm having trouble with the wireless card.  Could someone help me?
11:05	<Crazy_Freak>	hi, I need help, can anyone help me? :)
11:05	<r00tintheb0x>	FreeSoul, did you do a "aptitude update" 1st?
11:05	<velko>	nibsa1242b, and what happens when you do "sudo apt-get upgrade" ? this will install any remaining packages, which was eventually not installed because of the error
11:05	<FreeSoul>	r00tintheb0x, no, i do it now
11:05	<chowmeined>	frolle: which device?
11:05	<r00tintheb0x>	okay

11:06	<Crazy_Freak>	ok
11:06	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Exactly
11:06	<ExpositionOfEvil>	what if I lose internet connection from my router, which is right next to me?  I think its from interference from other people in my area.  What should I do?
11:06	<nibsa1242b>	velko it says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded
11:06	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: does your system have a root user?
11:06	<Crazy_Freak>	I have HSP56 MicroModem, were can I find drivers, and how to install them... I'm linux newbie
11:06	<cox377_>	is the new kubuntu as smooth as this new ubuntu
11:06	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: No, do I need to create one?
11:07	<frolle>	chowmeined: it says when i type: ls -l /dev/mapper, it says it cant find control

11:08	<SarahDavies>	I found the driver in an exe file, and I've tried unzipping it, unshielding it, and cabextracting it, but none of those have worked, what should I do?
11:08	<r00tintheb0x>	SarahDavies, a driver for what?
11:08	<r00tintheb0x>	wireless?
11:08	<SarahDavies>	wireless card for a macbook

11:09	<FreeSoul>	bye tnx
11:09	<r00tintheb0x>	okay SarahDavies you found the macbook driver in a .exe file?
11:09	<`davo>	El_Burro any luck?
11:09	<cheeko>	my research tells me that just editing the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list to replace all occurences of 'edgy' with 'feisty' then updating/installing through aptitude will upgrade the distro. is it really this easy, or is there something else i need to do afterwards?
11:09	<r00tintheb0x>	SarahDavies, i dont have any experience with Mac hardware, im sorry.
11:09	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, thats the way i do it... but it isnt reccomended.
11:09	<El_Burro>	nope, just reverting my xorg.conf back now
11:09	<cheeko>	why not?
11:09	<r00tintheb0x>	recommended
11:09	<`davo>	hm.
11:09	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x ^
11:09	<Helmi>	hmm i'm searching for a thread in the forums which is read a few weeks ago - it was about "must have desktop tools" or sth. Probably anyone knows where i can find it? There was a great tool which gave a handy terminal window switchable via F1 (on/off).. probably anyone here knows what i'm talking about ;) i can't remember the name unfortunately - it was something like "tide"..
11:10	<r00tintheb0x>	that isnt the supported way cheeko
11:10	<`davo>	El_Burro, let me know if you find anything
11:10	<nibsa1242b>	velko omg it works! thank goodness
11:10	<velko>	nibsa1242b, congrats
11:10	<El_Burro>	just reading up at the mo
11:10	<SarahDavies>	r00tintheb0x: yes, I found a tutorial that told me how to install from a .inf file, but I have to unzip the exe file somehow to do that
11:10	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : well... does it Just Work?

11:10	<enry>	Amd X2 is supported by ubuntu or i have to install a kernel ad hoc (like smp)?
11:10	<SarahDavies>	orbin: yes, exactly
11:10	<El_Burro>	'davo https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
11:10	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, if you're comfortable with linux you shouldn't have a problem.
11:11	<orbin>	SarahDavies: cabextract should work.  are you sure you have the right driver exe?
11:11	<vladi_h_>	Indeed putting reject 192.168.1.1 in dhclient.conf stopped rewriting resolve.conf and dns entries from ISP still there
11:11	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i'm fairly comfortable but i never upgraded a distro, only new kernel compiles
11:11	<orbin>	SarahDavies: what exactly happened?
11:11	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i want to retain my configs/settings/files/etc
11:11	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, any reason you dont want to use Ubuntu's update manager?
11:11	<enry>	weyyy Ubuntu is good with core duo processor???
11:11	<chowmeined>	frolle: do you have dmsetup and libdevmapper installed?
11:11	<nbjayme>	ah... after some research opengl version is depends on 3D video card.
11:12	<`davo>	El_Burro, it working for you?
11:12	<enry>	weyyy Ubuntu is good with core duo processor??? i can buy also a single core!
11:12	<frolle>	i only typed apt-get install cryptsetup hashalot
11:12	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : i'm not on my linux box at the moment, i didn't know the update manager would update the distro for me :p
11:12	<r00tintheb0x>	cheeko, system>administration>update manager.
11:12	<r00tintheb0x>	yep it will cheeko
11:12	<SarahDavies>	orbin:  I looked up the driver on http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List, so I'm fairly sure I have the right one
11:12	<r00tintheb0x>	:)
11:12	<El_Burro>	'davo nope, but your setup might be differnt to mine
11:12	<cheeko>	r00tintheb0x : well that's even easier, thanks
11:12	<`davo>	ah
11:12	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: The directory is chmodded to 755
11:12	<nubbe>	I shut down edgy without shutting down Azureus first, so now azureus starts and then dumps it's core. How do I fix this?

11:13	<frolle>	chowmeined: it says that i have both in newest version
11:13	<psycop>	Hey
11:13	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: so only the owner can write ...
11:13	<liquiddoom>	...I just highlighted myself. How bright.
11:13	<ScottSatkin>	Is there a risk updating from dapper->feisty, skipping edgy?
11:13	<chowmeined>	frolle: is this on feisty?
11:13	<psycop>	i was wondering, can yu make a partition that can be read/written on from both OS(Linux and Windows XP)
11:13	<frolle>	chowmeined: yes it is
11:13	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: ok 777
11:14	<velko>	ScottSatkin, i done it several times. but it is not a smooth ride
11:14	<dj-fu>	psycop: fat32
11:14	<Danltn>	Psycop, I believe both Linux and Windows can read FAT32
11:14	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: echo test >	test.txt-bash: test.txt: Permission denied
11:14	<dj-fu>	but there are some implications of fat32, you can't have files bigger than 4gb
11:14	<dj-fu>	(dvd images = out of the question)
11:14	<Danltn>	^^ That's true
11:14	<psycop>	yeah not too keen about having fat32
11:14	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Huh, now it doesn't even work as root
11:14	<psycop>	hmm
11:14	<dj-fu>	otherwise ext3 and the ifs-ext3 driver for windows.
11:15	<psycop>	will that allow me to see the drives from windows?
11:15	<kritzstapf>	what about ntfs?
11:15	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Lemme check my smb.conf and fstab, hang on
11:15	<Danltn>	No
11:15	<underwatercow>	 is there a GUI way to edit drive labels?
11:15	<Danltn>	Linux can't write to NTFS
11:15	<Danltn>	Only read
11:15	<kritzstapf>	ntfs-3g
11:15	<kritzstapf>	full write support
11:15	<Danltn>	Oo, Didn't know that.
11:16	<kritzstapf>	im using it for a while, runs flawless
11:16	<psycop>	ntfs-3g? whats that?
11:16	<orbin>	SarahDavies: unshield didn't work either?
11:16	<SarahDavies>	orbin: nope
11:16	<afflux>	psycop: ntfs read/write support
11:16	<J-_>	With an alternative CD, is it the same method to install as a regular cd? Boots from the RAM, and you install from an icon on the desktop? or is it totally different?
11:16	<psycop>	for linux? nice
11:17	<orbin>	SarahDavies: what's the letter.number reference for your card on that list?
11:17	<exzrael>	Hi, may I ask, how well do dual-screen work with Ubuntu. I have one digital and one analog working together in Windows, but does it work with ubuntu?
11:17	<SarahDavies>	orbin: 168c:0024
11:17	<orbin>	J-_: alternate uses a text-based installer.  there is no desktop
11:17	<Danltn>	http://www.ntfs-3g.org/
11:17	<Vanuatoo_>	I've got ubuntu 7.04. ATI Radeon X850XT with ati binary drivers. AMD 3500+. I've got random X crashes. programs crashing and X too. I've got 100% reproducible case with firefox. When I'm starting it it closes after 3 seconds.
11:17	<chowmeined>	frolle: and you have created the partition already?
11:18	<chowmeined>	frolle: what if you just do... cryptsetup create 'name' '/path/to/block-dev'
11:18	<J-_>	orbin: ah ok, cool. thanks. =)
11:18	<frolle>	chowmeined: well... i have split my dev/hda1 in 3.. The 2 other partitions are primary aswell.. i dont know if that is possbile
11:19	<orbin>	SarahDavies: Item I-15? Laptop: IBM(Lenovo)Thinkpad T60 2623?
11:19	<Vanuatoo_>	anyone?
11:19	<dj-fu>	totally different
11:19	<chowmeined>	frolle: it can use a partition
11:19	<dj-fu>	theyre non-live afaicr
11:19	<chowmeined>	frolle: it doesnt have to be the whole drive
11:19	<Danltn>	Hmm
11:19	<SarahDavies>	orbin: that's the one
11:19	<dj-fu>	whoa, was scrolled up - woops
11:19	<frolle>	chowmeined: okay..
11:19	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do i do now?
11:19	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, if you have binary drivers installed all bets are off. they are black boxes and only the manufactures can help you with such issues
11:20	<chowmeined>	frolle: it should have asked for a password did it?
11:20	<fiery_cleric>	Vanuatoo_: have u checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
11:20	<Danltn>	FFs
11:20	<Danltn>	I need to reinstall my Windows.
11:20	<J-_>	orbin: Would it be the same concept with a dual system? ie., delete partitions, make a small win2000 partition. install it. then let Ubuntu pick up the remaining disk space for the install?
11:20	<Danltn>	I have 2 HDs, If I just install WIndows to the new one, the old one won't be affected right?
11:20	<frolle>	chowmeined: path/to/.. is that for example: /dev/hda2
11:20	<chowmeined>	yes
11:20	<Vanuatoo_>	fiery_cleric: I'll check when X crashes
11:21	<frolle>	chowmeined: 2sec then
11:21	<chowmeined>	and then 'name' can be anything.. you just give it a name
11:21	<Vanuatoo_>	What should I do then
11:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: like i use
11:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: cryptsetup create crypt /dev/sda3
11:21	<fiery_cleric>	Danltn: i would just unplug it just in case :)
11:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: it asks for a password.. which it uses to encrypt that and it shows up as /dev/mapper/crypt
11:21	<mindframe->	hows java and adobe flash support in feisty amd64 ?
11:21	<orbin>	J-_: something like that.  do you have win2000 already installed?
11:21	<Danltn>	nah firey
11:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: now i can mount it.. mount /dev/mapper/crypt /mnt/cryptfs
11:21	<selinuxium>	Is anyone about? I have a broken Upgrade, had a power out during the Upgrade and I now have Feider system, or is that Dapstie? Any road up, I need to get past bzip2 which will not upgrade. Any help gratefully received!
11:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: or anywhere id like to mount it
11:21	<Danltn>	I had way too many issues getting recognised to change
11:21	<Danltn>	getting it recognised*
11:22	<J-_>	orbin, well I pretty much did that with XP and Ubuntu but with a regular installation
11:22	<frolle>	chowmeined: i get error
11:22	<orbin>	SarahDavies: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16994/
11:22	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: smb.conf has the share set to read/write and default perms 777, but I still can't write as any user

11:23	<fortitUs>	I just hung ubuntu for half an hour running a program
11:23	<orbin>	J-_: regular as in w/ the desktop cd?
11:23	<fortitUs>	:)
11:23	<orbin>	SarahDavies: seemed to go ok for me. :-/
11:23	<kiba-kun_>	i need help :(
11:23	<SarahDavies>	orbin: hmm, I wonder what I'm doing wrong, maybe it's objecting to me extracting to the desktop rather than a folder?
11:23	<chowmeined>	frolle: I think mine was already in by default cause I installed with LVM
11:23	<frolle>	chowmeined: Command failed: device-mapper: reload ioctl failed: Invalid argument
11:24	<chowmeined>	frolle: modprobe dm_mod

11:24	<psycop>	wasnt there a partition manager in ubuntu?
11:24	<chowmeined>	psycop: you can install gparted
11:24	<liquiddoom>	psycop: sudo apt-get isntall gparted
11:24	<kiba-kun_>	how can i deactivate the desktop effects from the console????
11:25	<psycop>	ty
11:25	<frolle>	chowmeined: i typed in my password, but its kinda stuck now
11:25	<orbin>	SarahDavies: possibly.
11:25	<Danltn>	Does anyone know of any Linux themes (for Windows)
11:25	<liquiddoom>	...yay for typos
11:25	<nubbe>	I shut down edgy without shutting down Azureus first, so now azureus starts and then dumps it's core. How do I fix this?
11:25	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: it could be to do with user permissions ... i use "security=share" in my smb.conf ... its easier for my setup ... if u are not to concerned about having user permissions on your shares
11:25	<chowmeined>	frolle: did you run modprobe dm_crypt after doing modprobe dm_mod?
11:25	<what_if>	nubbe: reinstall it
11:25	<frolle>	i did that before
11:25	<chowmeined>	frolle: dm_crypt failed to load because it requires dm_mod.. so thats why I had you modprobe dm_mod.. but you also need dm_crypt
11:26	<kiba-kun_>	how can i deactivate the desktop effects from the console????
11:26	<threw>	hi all !
11:26	<nubbe>	what_if, k
11:26	<chowmeined>	frolle: and also.. modprobe aes
11:26	<kritzstapf>	hm, no acrobat reader debs in feisty? :(
11:26	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Where does that go in the file? Right under "writable = yes"?
11:27	<mindframe->	is there a package that will automatically update fluxbox menus in feisty?
11:27	<chowmeined>	kritzstapf: Evince has also worked great for me.. it also runs a lot faster imo
11:27	<kritzstapf>	chowmeined, missing some printing options
11:27	<fiery_cleric>	fiery_cleric: it should be alread there the default is "security=user" its a global option at the top ... look at man smb.conf for how this effects things
11:27	<frolle>	chowmeined: now i added them in that order.. still stuck..
11:27	<crimsun>	kritzstapf: we're not allowed to distribute it freely.
11:28	<kritzstapf>	okay, so ill use evince or install the tar.gz from adobe
11:28	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Found it.
11:28	<orbin>	anyone willing to give me a hand with ndiswrapper?  i think i've got all my settings right, but i can't seem to connect via nm-applet - it just spins.  details: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16990/

11:29	<SarahDavies>	orbin: it works now, thanks for your help!
11:29	<chowmeined>	frolle: substitute those names with your values
11:29	<Vanuatoo_>	this is the xorg.conf
11:29	<Vanuatoo_>	http://pastebin.ca/452480
11:29	<frolle>	chowmeined: i am getting command failed
11:29	<chowmeined>	frolle: could  you paste the output exactly for me?
11:29	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: Still no luck with writing. Could it be the client's smb.conf being odd?
11:30	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: i am not sure whats the command you are mounting the share with?
11:30	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: A line in fstab

11:32	<threw>	may anyone help me please ?
11:32	<stefg>	!samba | dale
11:32	<ubotu>	dale: samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
11:32	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, im looking hold up
11:32	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: have you tried mounting without the options ie mount -t smbfs //192.168.0.7/ime /media/ime
11:32	<zcat[1] >	lungan, use the x86 version, otherwise you'll have trouble finding things like flash, codecs, nonfree drivers..
11:33	<threw>	r00tintheb0x: thank you
11:33	<dale>	Hey thanks let me give that a try, Ill look it up
11:33	<YNWA>	hi, does anyone use VMware? Could you direct me to a place where there're instructions? Thanks
11:33	<dale>	Samba you say
11:33	<lungan>	xcat[1] , okey thx
11:33	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, if you're booting from the CDROM are you sure you can eject the OS CD and burn a CDROM?
11:33	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, do you have a wacom device attached?
11:34	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: That works fine, but I still can't write
11:34	<frolle>	chowmeined: i cant pm you
11:34	<dale>	Is there a way to get a .net framework for linux?
11:34	<Strayker>	TNWA: go to www.vmware.com, you can download and install the Workstation version.  It works really well :)
11:34	<liquiddoom>	dale: mono?
11:34	<chowmeined>	frolle: one sec
11:34	<frolle>	oki
11:34	<threw>	rookiehwm: the live cd is in "ATAPI:0,0,0          JLMS    , XJ-HD166S       , DS1A" so its different cd burner
11:34	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, if you're booting from the CDROM are you sure you can eject the OS CD and burn a CDROM?
11:34	<YNWA>	strayker: thanks :-D
11:34	<threw>	oops
11:34	<chowmeined>	frolle: use this site to paste it: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
11:34	<Strayker>	no worries
11:34	<dale>	Im a vb developer but want to go over to linux, so mono you say. Thanks for that
11:34	<YNWA>	strayker: not the server version?
11:35	<threw>	r00tintheb0x: the live cd is in "ATAPI:0,0,0          JLMS    , XJ-HD166S       , DS1A" so its different cd burner
11:35	<dale>	Is mono quiet easy to get and install?
11:35	<ivoks>	dale: mono is linux implementation of .net
11:35	<ivoks>	dale: so, it's not a program, but a language
11:35	<liquiddoom>	dale: No clue, I just looked at the page once and saw that it worked with .net
11:35	<zcat[1] >	r00tintheb0x, you can't. But if you have two drives, and one's a burner, you can burn stuff on one drive while running from the other
11:35	<chowmeined>	I think mono is already installed.. because F-Spot uses it
11:35	<what_if>	dale: is in the repositories
11:35	<dale>	Oh ok , same syntax?
11:35	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, you have... oh ok zcat[1]  i see now

11:36	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, what do you get form "dmesg |grep hdd"
11:36	<r00tintheb0x>	?
11:36	<liquiddoom>	surviver: GIMP
11:36	<Strayker>	YNWA: you will have to install build-essential and linux-headers-generic and gcc3.4 to compile it though.  And yes, the Workstation version is very good, you don't NEED the server ver, it's upto you
11:36	<liquiddoom>	surviver: Or krita
11:36	<Trist_an>	I'd like to make a bash script that would act like ImageGrabber for Windows
11:36	<DaMi3n>	can someone help me with imwheel? i tried the settings on the guide and now my scroll doesnt work
11:36	<dale>	No thats fine , just want to develop in ssame language
11:36	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: so the permissions on the mount on the client are 755 ?
11:36	<zcat[1] >	some live cd's like puppy load themselves fully into ram; those you can eject the disk and burn on the same drive :)
11:36	<surviver>	liquiddoom, can he cloon?
11:36	<psycop>	What good torrent client is there for linux?
11:36	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: who is the owner?

11:36	<liquiddoom>	fiery_cleric: root
11:36	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, did you not see the warning "cdrecord: There are unsettled issues with Linux-2.5 and newer."?
11:36	<surviver>	liquiddoom, oke i search out :)

11:36	<Trist_an>	psycop, I use ktorrent under KDE and it's quite decent
11:37	<chowmeined>	frolle: did you upgrade from edgy? or is this a new install?
11:37	<threw>	r00tintheb0x:  yes but how can i burn a cd so ?!
11:37	<liquiddoom>	surviver: gimp is faster, and it's already installed
11:37	<frolle>	chowmeined: all new install
11:37	<liquiddoom>	surviver: It's in graphics >	GIMP image editor
11:37	<YNWA>	strayker: but the workstation isn't free, right?
11:37	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, use k3b or gnome baker.
11:37	<DaMi3n>	also the imwheel -c window comes too small to see anything
11:37	<frolle>	chowmeined: i had it working in 6.10, but its seemning not possible..
11:37	<threw>	r00tintheb0x: the cdrecord command doesnt add anything to dmesg
11:37	<YNWA>	(I hate forking out $$)
11:37	<surviver>	liquiddoom, yes i found that now iam searching the clooning tool
11:37	<assasukasse>	hi everyone, i have a problem with the trashcan applet, it is always empty even if there are files inside.
11:37	<dale>	guys ive started using wine, is this the best choice to emulate windows apps?
11:38	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, i dont know what you're talking about... but okay.
11:38	<liquiddoom>	surviver: Use the tool which looks like a rubber stamp. crtl-click to pick the point to align to
11:38	<Strayker>	YMWA:  it's a beta test version, it's free and fully functional.  I have just been using it, it works perfectly :)
11:38	<zcat[1] >	cdrecord's been warning about 'issues' for years. Normally it still works just fine
11:38	<r00tintheb0x>	im just trying to figure out where your cdrw is.
11:38	<r00tintheb0x>	ok zcat[1] 
11:38	<Trist_an>	assasukasse, you need to edit the trash file on your desktop
11:38	<surviver>	liquiddoom, thx let me see:)
11:38	<chowmeined>	frolle: try: sudo modprobe dm-crypt dm_mod aes and then try again
11:38	<threw>	r00tintheb0x: i tried to install k3b and there is not enough free space when using livecd :(
11:38	<DaMi3n>	can somone please help me configuring a 5 button mouse?
11:38	<Strayker>	YMWA:  Plus I believe it also has experimental direct3d support, but I haven't tried that yet
11:38	<assasukasse>	Trist_an: i am talking about the applet, how can i do it?
11:38	<surviver>	liquiddoom, thx found it thank you
11:38	<Vanuatoo_>	velko I don't even know what it is
11:38	<liquiddoom>	surviver: /msg me if you need any more help. I'm a photographer, so I'm pretty familiar with it
11:38	<frolle>	chowmeined: still the same error..
11:39	<chowmeined>	frolle: one sec
11:39	<Ubuntulator>	think i might move the ext3 partition to the front of the HD using partition magic any objections to doing this the HD i'm using is not the XP boot its just an NTFS drive with media on it ?
11:39	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, you posted your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, right?
11:39	<surviver>	liquiddoom, lol iam more in photoshop .. but that only works with windows
11:39	<Trist_an>	assasukasse, you need to have one line with EmptyIcon= path to the empty icon file and one with Icon=path to the icon of full trash can
11:39	<Vanuatoo_>	Yes
11:39	<YNWA>	strayker: hmm... I'll give it a try then, thanks. I just couldn't get the server version working, it just have VERY detailed instructions for Red Hat
11:39	<Strayker>	hahah, I have Compiz working perfectly on the liveCD :)
11:39	<Trist_an>	assasukasse, do you want me to pastebin my trash applet?
11:39	<Vanuatoo_>	velko: It's generated automatically
11:39	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, open it as root, find these lines and prepend them with "#"
11:39	<binskipy2u>	so far this fiesty rocks
11:39	<liquiddoom>	surviver: gimpshop is a version of gimp which is meant to behave like photoshop
11:39	<fiery_cleric>	liquiddoom: on my writable share in smb.conf i have these lines: available = yes  , browseable = yes , public = yes, writeable = yes
11:39	<assasukasse>	Trist_an: thanks, also the name of the file i need to edit
11:39	<Vanuatoo_>	ok
11:39	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, after that restart X

11:47	<velko>	jacquesmerde, if you installed the packages with something else than aptitude, aptitude will not be able to automaticaly remove the unused packages
11:48	<linux__alien>	nipun i also use PPPOE connection but currently downloading Fiesty Fawn so really dont know even mine would work
11:48	<nipun>	using whatis?
11:48	<frolle>	chowmeined: it says i dont have that
11:48	<linux__alien>	nipun does it happen with all pppoeconf connection?
11:48	<what_if>	Z__: "

11:49	<matt1982>	anyone know if it is possible to get the microsoft windowsremote to work on ubuntu?

11:49	<YNWA>	lol
11:50	<slackern>	jacquesmerde, i don't see that option in synaptic so i don't think they added it not as far as i can see atleast
11:50	<|ringo|>	psycop: lots of extensions cause cpu/ram troubles, also lots of tabs.  if that isnt your case, switch to opera
11:50	<Strayker>	YNWA: I need a "Homer Simpson fat bastards keyboard" :)

11:52	<psycop>	should be able to handle 75
11:52	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do we do?
11:52	<chowmeined>	kusit912: you can use the sftp built into ssh.. if you want secure (although its not compatible with most clients)

11:53	<infornography>	Anybody else having trouble with X failing to start on boot?
11:53	<|ringo|>	psycop: it depends on your specific monitor
11:53	<frolle>	chowmeined: no
11:53	<velko>	jacquesmerde, yes. setting repos is not related to installation (this is equivalent to editing the file /etc/apt/sources.list). so you can do it with synaptic and install with aptitude
11:53	<slackern>	wow finally found where to disable join/part in xchat, only took me a week :)
11:53	<psycop>	|ringo| its a samsung syncmaster 940b

11:54	<chowmeined>	frolle: so libdevmapper is installed? but it still gives that error when you run cryptsetup?

11:54	<liquiddoom>	kusit912: Over here, I use proftpd. I configured it by its webmin module
11:54	<thenetduck>	does anyone here have the xorg.config file for a regular macbook?
11:54	<thenetduck>	I messed mine up
11:54	<frolle>	chowmeined: yes i am afraid
11:54	<|ringo|>	psycop: that one can go up to 75
11:55	<psycop>	yes, but the highest i can pick is 55
11:55	<r00tintheb0x>	threw, what was the error you got?
11:55	<chowmeined>	frolle: what does it say again when you ls /dev/mapper?
11:55	<|ringo|>	psycop: DVI ?
11:55	<kusit912>	liquiddoom:  does it have a grafical interface?
11:55	<psycop>	yes
11:55	<kevin_u_>	Does someone know how to remove the join/part text?
11:55	<liquiddoom>	kusit912: I don't think so
11:55	<velko>	kevin_u_, are you using xchat?
11:55	<kusit912>	liquiddoom:  is it easy to configure?
11:55	<|ringo|>	psycop: not totally sure on this, but i think with DVI, the hardware just picks the optimal vsync
11:55	<kevin_u_>	Yes
11:55	<frolle>	chowmeined: not it says control, STRANGE!
11:55	<kevin_u_>	Im using Xchat
11:55	<buster_>	meh :( so noone using twinview?
11:55	<jacquesmerde>	velko: what advantage would aptitude have over installing apps through synaptic, and uninstalling cli with apt-get autoremove?
11:56	<Stew2>	Question: Why, when I put in the cd for 7.x and liveboot from it, does it ask me for a username/password. I've not seen any reference to it, and previous versions didn't ask.
11:56	<liquiddoom>	kusit912: With the webmin module, it is. I don't know about the config by hand, though
11:56	<kerik>	hey guys

11:56	<thenetduck>	who do I reinstall my xorg?
11:56	<velko>	kevin_u_, right click on #ubuntu (left column) and deselect "show join/part messages"

11:59	<hobojohn3>	nehuen: u need hlp?
11:59	<|ringo|>	psycop:  well maybe someone else here has some more experiene with editing xorg.conf than i do
11:59	<r00tintheb0x>	if that doesn't work, you need to check the flags in cdrecord and use some for your recorder.

12:02	<hobojohn3>	i am having an error "Failed to fetch http://media.blutkind.org/xgl/dists/edgy/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz 404 Not Found" in upgrading from edgy. how do i fix this?
12:02	<psycop>	yeah LegionX found it, says 60hz here :/ still not 75 tho
12:03	<LegionX>	psycop: are you sure it means anything though? i think TFT's output in another way, so it probably wouldn't matter

12:03	<YNWA>	could anyone please help with installing a driver?
12:03	<nehuen>	newbie seeks help...I'm having trouble with program compiling...!
12:04	<velko>	hobojohn3, the url you posted explicitly names edgy and you mentioned the word "updgrade". maybe on the server they removed the edgy repo?

12:05	<velko>	YNWA, ask your question. nobody can help you if you don't ask
12:05	<sbn>	Hi, how can I undo the command: sudo rmmod snd_intel8x0
12:05	<frolle>	chowmeined: cbc is not blcipher is
12:05	<chowmeined>	frolle: modprobe cbc

12:06	<hobojohn3>	velco im clicking the upgrade button in update manager
12:06	<impulse>	hi all. im up to installing an ATi driver to my ubuntu 6.06. ive used this command under root: sh ati-driver-installer-8.36.5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/dapper. but it didnt work
12:06	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, did you remove your kernel?
12:06	<YNWA>	I simply need a "kick-start" on how to install a driver. I downloaded the zip file, un-zipped it, and... here's the bit where i need help :)
12:06	<NemesisD>	guys i've got some problems here, i've installed drivers for my dwl-g132 dongle with ndiswrapper, dmesg|grep ndis now shows no errors when the driver loads, i've got blinking lights but NO wlan0 in network manager, any ideas?
12:06	<chowmeined>	frolle: it gets used when you run cryptsetup
12:06	<sbn>	r00tintheb0x, ?
12:06	<nehuen>	beryl-core... i made a few changes in two files 'cause I was having some gdesklets issues: http://bugs.beryl-project.org/changeset/3450
12:06	<chowmeined>	frolle: try cryptsetup create crypt /dev/hda2
12:07	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, nevermind
12:07	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, "sudo modprobe snd_intel8x0"
12:07	<r00tintheb0x>	no
12:07	<r00tintheb0x>	wait
12:08	<frolle>	chowmeined: huh..
12:08	<sbn>	so no way to get it back?
12:08	<kevin_u__>	Does somebody here  know how to get Nvidia drivers to Geforce FX 5700LE? Im using Ubuntu 7.04.. I have accepted the driver from Nvidia the "accelerate Nvidia driver" is that it? or can i have a Nvidia driver like in windows?
12:08	<chowmeined>	frolle: try running cryptsetup again
12:08	<frolle>	chowmeined: im not getting any error now..
12:08	<muxx>	oh so you're basically recompiling a deb package with a couple of changed files?
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, "sudo modprobe "snd-intel8x0
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	try that sbn
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	wait
12:08	<velko>	hobojohn3, the repository that cannot be found is *not* officialy supported ubuntu repository. you added it yourself (or somebody told you to do it)
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	lol
12:08	<chowmeined>	frolle: it went?
12:08	<chowmeined>	frolle: ls /dev/mapper
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, sudo modprobe snd-intel8x0
12:08	<frolle>	chowmeined: crypt is there
12:08	<impulse>	that is what the error it gave me : Generating package: Ubuntu/dapper
12:08	<impulse>	./packages/Ubuntu/ati-packager.sh: line 57: dpkg-architecture: command not foundError: unsupported architecture:
12:08	<frolle>	chowmeined: what happened?
12:08	<chowmeined>	frolle: excellent it worked
12:08	<frolle>	chowmeined: :)
12:08	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: have you looked at the new restricted drivers manager?
12:08	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, did that work?
12:08	<chowmeined>	frolle: mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/crypt
12:08	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: it's in your administration menu
12:09	<chowmeined>	frolle: and mount away
12:09	<hobojohn3>	velko: k how do i remove it
12:09	<sbn>	r00tintheb0x, FATAL: Module snd_intel8x0 not found.
12:09	<YNWA>	 sudo ./install.sh
12:09	<YNWA>	whoops
12:09	<nehuen>	I don't really know :S I followed the readme to "compile".. I did ./configure, ./make and ./make install ... I got a BERYL file...with no extension.. in its properties it says "e execytable"
12:09	<Stew2>	cvk77, thanks, but as you can see, I speak english!
12:09	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, yes and i have accepted the driver from Nvidia, but is that the same drivers  as the driver from www.nvidia.com
12:09	<chowmeined>	frolle: it needed dm_crypt, dm_mod, aes, cbc and blkcipher
12:09	<nehuen>	"x executable"
12:09	<YNWA>	I did sudo ./install.sh
12:09	<YNWA>	and then
12:09	<YNWA>	it said: Cannot find BioAPI files.
12:09	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, sudo updatedb && locate snd-intel8x0m.ko
12:09	<cvk77>	Stew2: sorry. you got an arcop ip adress, so i thought you were probably german
12:09	<cvk77>	arcor even
12:09	<velko>	hobojohn3, edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list as root. put # at the beginning of the lines you want to comment out
12:09	<chowmeined>	frolle: btw.. cbc should say 1 now since you made the crypt device
12:09	<drkm_>	I just installed new version of ubuntu over my old one but now my cdrom wont mount.. when I ls /dev/ there are no hda or hdb or anything I can mount.. anyone know why?
12:09	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: yes i think it is. I'm running Beryl very well with that driver.. burning windows and all
12:09	<chowmeined>	frolle: in lsmod
12:10	<Stew2>	cvk77 Ahhhh
12:10	<frolle>	chowmeined: yeah, but it doesnt..
12:10	<hiways85>	ubuntu complicated huh
12:11	<muxx>	nehuen: if you want to install anything to /usr (or in this case /usr/local ), you have to use "sudo make install"
12:11	<sbn>	r00tintheb0x, /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/kernel/sound/pci/snd-intel8x0m.ko
12:11	<chowmeined>	frolle: but it is working right?
12:11	<cheeko>	how can i show boot information instead of just the ubuntu splash screen when booting? i removed the "quiet" line from the entry in grub but it has no effect
12:11	<r00tintheb0x>	ok sbn
12:11	<sbn>	modprobe agian?
12:12	<cheeko>	i also tried adding "verbose" just to see if it would do anything :<
12:12	<YNWA>	Does anyone know how to install a fingerprint driver from UPEK?
12:12	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, you could probably reboot and it'll come back up
12:12	<Baktaah>	Could someone help me get Java working?
12:12	<velko>	cheeko, remove "splash" too
12:12	<frolle>	chowmeined: to mount: sudo cryptsetup mount /dev/mapper/crypt /media/crypt
12:12	<sbn>	ctrl +alt +backspace good enough?
12:12	<chowmeined>	frolle: no.. once its made just treat it like a normal partition
12:12	<muxx>	nehuen: and if you want to run the executable from current directory, you have to type ./beryl
12:12	<paolo>	Hi all, today my Software Updates doesn't show the new release :-(
12:12	<frolle>	chowmeined: true..
12:12	<chowmeined>	frolle: sudo mount /dev/mapper/crypt /media/crypt
12:12	<r00tintheb0x>	no sbn you need to reboot... so the modules can reinitialize.
12:12	<cheeko>	velko: thanks
12:12	<sbn>	ok
12:12	<QOOQ>	i'm used to KDE/suse
12:13	<sbn>	then I'll reboot
12:13	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, well i tried to open the game "chess" in 3D mode, and just get it cant open it in 3D
12:13	<kerik>	any thinkpad users here?
12:13	<drkm_>	I just installed new version of ubuntu over my old one but now my cdrom wont mount.. when I ls /dev/ there are no hda or hdb or anything I can mount.. anyone know why?
12:13	<frolle>	chowmeined: is it necessary to encrypt swap aswell? i did it on 6.10, but..?
12:13	<nehuen>	I did that..I first ./configure, then make and then make install.. is that it? how do I know if the program is installed...I mean..how do I use it al all..(sorry..I'm really new at this)
12:13	<clapper>	I'm a newby and just upgraded from ubuntu 6.06 to 7.04. I do a little embedded development using the gnu tools. Anyway, I power my target board with a USB cable. With the new version, the USB power levels fluctuate causing a powerfail on my target. If I reboot with the previous version Kernel (2.6.17-11-386 #2 Mar 13th) - there's no problem. Who/where do I go to post this issue? Thanks.
12:13	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you feel you want that security
12:13	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: okay.. but i got it working by doing nothing else
12:13	<paolo>	am I the only one that cannot upgrade because the softwae update doesn't shoe 7.04?
12:14	<QOOQ>	is there any wine supported list?
12:14	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
12:14	<frolle>	chowmeined: what do you mean by that? :)
12:14	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, so i can play Counter-Strike if i only have this driver?
12:14	<psycop>	I tried running WoW through Wine, only getting 70-80fps where in windows i had 200fps
12:14	<chowmeined>	frolle: with swap you can even use one time keys (the data is not restored on reboot).. so it gets destroyed each time.. but this means hibernate is not available
12:14	<psycop>	are there any other emu. software out there?
12:14	<impulse>	i managed to install the driver
12:14	<impulse>	i will do a reboot now to see if it works
12:15	<velko>	clapper, you can report it on the ubuntu page. they will push it upstream if it's an upstream bug
12:15	<muxx>	nehuen: I don't know how to run beryl
12:15	<QOOQ>	thnx
12:15	<Kaiser>	slm
12:15	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: i don't know anyone playing counterstrike, but i'd suppose you should.
12:15	<clapper>	thanks. Ciao!
12:15	<frolle>	chowmeined: i am not useing that.. so efter reboot its gone.. thats for suer?
12:15	<nehuen>	ok..no problem..thanx anyway :)!
12:15	<cheeko>	velko: the splash line isn't in the entry
12:15	<chowmeined>	frolle: if you want to encrypt swap.. i mean if this is a laptop which carries sensitive information encrypting swap wouldn't be a bad idea
12:15	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: did you restart after installing the driver?
12:15	<muxx>	nehuen: but if the compile ran without errors and the "make install" part was done with needed permissions, it should be installed
12:15	<frolle>	chowmeined: its my serv.. soo..?
12:15	<chowmeined>	frolle: right the setup you are using now is not one time key
12:15	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, do you know any one that play World of warcraft with that driver
12:16	<cheeko>	velko: there's only lines for root, kernel, initrd, savedefault and then boot. no quiet or splash
12:16	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, yes i restarted my system
12:16	<slackern>	cheeko, 'kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=xxx ro quiet splash' thats how mine looks default
12:16	<velko>	cheeko, can you post the "kernel" line?
12:16	<nehuen>	oh..i see..then I must have installed it...I should reboot or sth..
12:16	<cheeko>	oh
12:16	<cheeko>	-_-
12:16	<nehuen>	thanx muxx...I'll be nback :)
12:16	<hiways85>	www.submission.org ........ Islam is the kewlest religion. join everybody. by happy.
12:16	<cheeko>	velko: it's in the kernel line, i thought it was on a seperate line
12:16	<thenetduck>	is anyone running a macbook?
12:16	<chowmeined>	frolle: well if your server is locked up there is not really a point to encrypting the drives (because its only an issue when someone is trying to access the drives when the computer isnt running its normal os)
12:16	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: all i know is that i got beryl working, and i never did with an earlier version of ubuntu :) is there a linux wow client?
12:16	<hiways85>	be happy*
12:16	<velko>	cheeko, ;-)
12:16	<chowmeined>	frolle: i mean the drive encryption only stops someone from accessing your stuff if they are on a livecd or something
12:16	<LegionX>	kevin_u__:  i play wow, but i didn't think i could on linux..
12:17	<drkm_>	HELP: I just installed new version of ubuntu over my old one but now my cdrom wont mount.. when I ls /dev/ there are no hda or hdb or anything I can mount.. anyone know why?
12:17	<frolle>	chowmeined: perfect.. how do i delete crypt?
12:17	<slackern>	drkm, If i understood it right feisty has renamed devices from hda/hdb etc to sda/sdb so try looking there
12:17	<chowmeined>	frolle: umount /media/crypt; cryptsetup remove crypt
12:17	<drkm_>	slackern: ok thanks
12:17	<hobojohn3>	is there a program out for fiesty yet that is like wicd?
12:17	<frolle>	chowmeined: do you have some nice bash scripts for it aswel? :)
12:17	<kevin_u__>	LegionX, Yes you can play WoW on linux, just use "Wine" or "cedega"
12:18	<velko>	hobojohn3, what is wicd?
12:18	<stefg>	slackern: it's not /that/ simple... it goes back and forth, depending on wheter libata is used or not
12:18	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: oh.. wine.. i hoped there were a real linux client :)
12:18	<stefg>	slackern: that's the reason UUID-based mounting was introduced in edgy
12:19	<slackern>	stefg, ahh i never had the problem myself, here my sata is still sdx and my dvd is still it's old hdc
12:19	<hobojohn3>	velko its an easy to use wireless network manager that lets me see all available networks and yeah i forgot i dont need it anymore
12:19	<hobojohn3>	so nvm thnx anyways
12:19	<sand_storm>	Hi
12:19	<patrick_>	!amd64-flash
12:19	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about amd64-flash - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
12:19	<kevin_u_>	No, unfortunately the havent created one.
12:20	<chowmeined>	frolle: actually i don't use encryption that much.. but if you want something automated look into LUKS
12:20	<kevin_u_>	LegionX, does cedega cost any money btw?
12:20	<sand_storm>	i know this is a really noob question but how do i check which version of Ubuntu i have (32 or 64)
12:20	<patrick_>	anyone know how to get flash working on an amd64
12:20	<frolle>	chowmeined: okay.. i never made a filesystem on crypt, so how do i remove it?
12:20	<kerik>	anybody who can tell me how to make a thinkpad mouse work in ubuntu?
12:20	<stefg>	slackern: the CD/DVD's will still have /dev/ .... no other way possible. But be aware when you tar up a partition and put in on another. you've got to take care of the new UUID in fstab
12:20	<LegionX>	kevin_u__: yes i think it does.. but i also heard that many people don't find it worth the money compared to the free wine
12:20	<chowmeined>	frolle: I know you can do things like require a usb key be plugged in and stuff
12:20	<Stew2>	kerik should work out of the box.
12:20	<AdministratorX>	86-64 is 64 bit
12:20	<chowmeined>	frolle: oh you didnt mount it?
12:21	<sand_storm>	and how do i know which i have =/
12:21	<frolle>	chowmeined: no not crypt, i made another
12:21	<sand_storm>	i need to dl an emulater for ps2 and it asks me
12:21	<kerik>	Stew2: well...it just acts completely crazy
12:21	<velko>	frolle, i haven't followed the discussion but this is the coolest encryption howto i've ever seen: http://www.debianhelp.org/node/1116
12:21	<chowmeined>	frolle: I am sorry, I don't understand
12:21	<kevin_u_>	LegionX, Yes i think ive heard that too
12:21	<datacrash>	join #ubuntu-de
12:21	<datacrash>	sry
12:22	<kerik>	Stew2: it clicks...or well opens programs and the curser is jumping around the screen if I use it..
12:22	<frolle>	chowmeined: its ok :)
12:22	<drkm_>	whenever I try to mount my cdrom it says: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad
12:22	<drkm_>	superblock on /dev/sdb,
12:22	<reaperc>	got a problem with feisty  and my usb external and flash drives.. I dont know what to do
12:22	<sbn>	r00tintheb0x, ok now the system is broke :s
12:22	<frolle>	chowmeined: i created crypt on /dev/hda4, but i never made a filesystem or mounted it
12:22	<sbn>	It won't auto mount my usb external hd
12:22	<sbn>	My usb mouse isn't working
12:22	<sbn>	my ethernet isn't working ...
12:22	<chowmeined>	frolle: ah
12:22	<frolle>	chowmeined: now i want to remove it, but how when i didnt do any of that?
12:22	<sand_storm>	-_-
12:22	<robinlinth>	Where can I get support for Stellarium? The fonts are very unreadable
12:22	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, you royally jacked something up.
12:22	<reaperc>	I figured out how to automount it by googleing it.. but now its super slow
12:22	<chowmeined>	frolle: all the things you make with cryptsetup are put in /dev/mapper
12:23	<r00tintheb0x>	what did you do before you rmmoded the sound card driver.
12:23	<r00tintheb0x>	what package did you remove?
12:23	<Rashid[584] >	Can anyone help me with bash scripting?
12:23	<sbn>	I removed nothing before it
12:23	<frolle>	chowmeined: true
12:23	<Stew2>	kerik Sounds like a hardware problem to me.
12:23	<sbn>	I just blacklisted it
12:23	<chowmeined>	frolle: using the name you gave it at the time of creation with cryptsetup
12:23	<sbn>	then i rmmod it
12:23	<chowmeined>	frolle: so use that same name with.. crypsetup remove name
12:23	<sbn>	now I unblacklisted it
12:23	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, why'd you blacklist it?
12:23	<sbn>	and did what you do
12:23	<Vanuatoo_>	where can I see what modules are loading with the kernel?
12:23	<frolle>	chowmeined: not found.. hmm..
12:23	<psycop>	Whats the best way to run wow on ubuntu?
12:23	<Stew2>	kerik It's sort of a built-in PS/2 pointing device, and shouldn't need any special support from Ubuntu.
12:23	<Rashid[584] >	anyone...? bash scripting?
12:23	<chowmeined>	frolle: ls /dev/mapper?
12:23	<sbn>	BEcause I didn't want my onboard audio, but my usb headset as adui
12:23	<sbn>	audio
12:23	<reaperc>	how can I speed up my usb flash and external on feisty?
12:23	<velko>	Vanuatoo_, sudo lsmod
12:23	<selinuxium>	Any users with computer resurrection power like Doctor Kildare working on Lazerus? I have a broken upgrade on my laptop. It had a power out during the upgrade so I now have a Feiper system or possibly a Dapsty. Basically I need to get past one broken package bzip2 which fails 'new pre-removal script returned error exit status 2'
12:23	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, what kind of errors are you getting?
12:24	<frolle>	chowmeined: it says its there when i type: ls -l /dev/mapper
12:24	<jo_>	morning
12:24	<r00tintheb0x>	morning jo_
12:24	<kerik>	Stew2: well it did work with dapper, but after I installed Feisty it's acting like this...
12:24	<cheeko>	ubuntu is working painfully slow right now, it took about 5 minutes to see my desktop after the gdm login window and i can't even open xterm now. last time i booted up ubuntu was performing fine and i haven't changed or installed anything -- what could possibly be causing the slowdown?
12:24	<velko>	selinuxium, i really don't understand this question
12:24	<sbn>	What I can see in the CTRL + ALT + F1: FATAL: Module binfmt_misc not found
12:24	<jo_>	i would like to pipe stdout to a url via http.. any tips to point me in the right direction maybe?
12:24	<kerik>	Stew2: it did the same when I used Mandriva...
12:24	<Vanuatoo_>	velko: I've got appropriate line in xorg.conf that disables composite extension. but Xorg.log gives me the following error
12:24	<Stew2>	kerik Ahhh.

12:33	<atle|f>	impulse : glxinfo | grep direct

12:33	<impulse>	ty, i will try
12:34	<tikka>	kevin_u, keeping in mind i haven't used wine in years.. knowing that .msi requires the microsoft installer to be.. installed when running windows.. maybe the same applies within WINE?
12:34	<atle|f>	impulse : should say yes

12:37	<kevin_u>	impulse, do i need to do someting with wine first?
12:37	<kevin_u>	Ive just installed it
12:37	<antidrugue>	frolle: if you installed it through synaptic/apt-get, then just uninstall it in synaptic
12:37	<Alfa>	sbn: sorry but what abour "xorg.conf"
12:37	<foug>	what's is Dbus?
12:37	<atle|f>	kevin_u: winecfg
12:37	<muxx>	cheeko: shift-F or shift-O lets you choose the sort column
12:37	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, that makes sense.
12:37	<frolle>	antidrugue: its a python script..
12:37	<fwtest>	hello, i am using ubuntu 6.10, i just downloaded the iso of version 7.04, how can i upgrade the system without having to burn on a cd?
12:37	<kevin_u>	atle|f, im kind of new so what do you mean?
12:37	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, fsck /dev/hda1
12:37	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, fsck /dev/hda2
12:38	<r00tintheb0x>	sbn, fsck /dev/hda3 (etc...etc...)
12:38	<impulse>	im going to read the FAQ on ATi page on how to install the driver
12:38	<YNWA>	when I do that : tar zxvf /home/chengzhe/Desktop/________________________.tar.gz , where does it install to? and how do I get rid of it?
12:38	<darksoft>	fwtest
12:38	<sbn>	fsck: fsck.ntfs: not found
12:38	<antidrugue>	frolle: perhaps you can take out the nzb file from the queue directory?
12:38	<jinzo>	YNWA, it only extraches it, like rar for example
12:38	<atle|f>	kevin_u: open terminal and type winecfg
12:38	<sbn>	fsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.ntfs for /dev/hda1
12:39	<YNWA>	jinzo: okay, where does it extract to?
12:39	<azlinux>	i just install released version 7.04 and now i have no sound on my asus v6800j. it was working fine when i used the beta 7.04 i.e kernel 2.6.20-13
12:39	<azlinux>	any1 had similar experience?
12:39	<frolle>	antidrugue: i want to uninstall hellanzb, to get an older version
12:39	<kevin_u>	atle|f yes done it, now i can choose operating system and so on
12:39	<aleix>	ynwa:  home/chengzhe/Desktop/________________________
12:39	<jinzo>	the same directory afaik, so it should be in /home/chengzhe/Desktop/
12:39	<fwtest>	darksoft, yes?
12:40	<YNWA>	aliex: hmm... thanks
12:40	<darksoft>	fwtest, you get that msg ?
12:40	<darksoft>	f'n clients a test, server is upgrading lol
12:40	<fwtest>	darkram, which msg?
12:40	<antidrugue>	frolle: perhaps google can help
12:41	<darksoft>	go to www.ubuntu.com and there is a download for cd, alternativly, go to system, administration, update manager tell me how that goes..
12:41	<frolle>	antidrugue: nothing there, still searching
12:41	<darksoft>	srry, my chats are screwy, workin on that now..........
12:41	<sbn>	r00tintheb0x you got that messagE?
12:41	<muxx>	cheeko: btw, if you want to install a more user friendly replacement for top, I would recommend htop
12:41	<antidrugue>	frolle: taking a look too, haven't found anything yet, but there is always something...
12:41	<fwtest>	darkram, i have downloaded the .iso, now how can i tell updae manager to use it to upgrade the system?
12:41	<cheeko>	i still can't figure out why my CPU usage is spiking... i don't know if it's the memory or the CPU but i think it's the latter; none of the processes running seem to be hogging up much of either, the most memory/cpu usage was from te update manager which i killed and now most is dedicated to Xorg which caps @ like 5% sometimes
12:41	<sbn>	fsck: fsck.ntfs: not found & fsck: Error 2 while executing fsck.ntfs for /dev/hda1
12:42	<cheeko>	it shouldn't take 30 seconds to open xterm
12:42	<muxx>	I agree
12:42	<kevin_u__>	Ive decided to remove wine, does any one here know how to remove wine and all the maps on my hdd from terminal
12:42	<Wicks>	morning all
12:42	<antidrugue>	frolle: is there anything interesting in /usr/share/doc/hellanzb/ ?
12:43	<darksoft>	flaguentwankertest: You don't need the iso to upgrade, you can do it through System ->	Administration ->	Update Manager. :)
12:43	<kevin_u__>	Ive decided to remove wine, does any one here know how to remove wine and all the maps on my hdd from terminal?
12:43	<frolle>	antidrugue, i was somewhere it was just to delete the hellanzb files

12:44	<atle|f>	kevin_u__: maybe that could help you along
12:44	<YNWA>	How do I resize a partition?
12:44	<antidrugue>	frolle: that makes sense, remove the files and uninstall the package
12:44	<kevin_u__>	atle|f thx
12:44	<darksoft>	I will grab you another link that may be of help - hold tight..
12:44	<ju_>	Hi everyone, I've got a big problem with my touchpad.

If someone could help me it would be grreeeat

12:45	<darksoft>	fwtest - please also referr to http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
12:45	<antidrugue>	ju_ : just add the relevant section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

12:59	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: ok i have foundit
12:59	<kerb>	isn't it possible to install feisty now without formatting? I used to just delete /usr and so on so I didn't have to back everything else up since I haven't partioned things that neatly
01:00	<antidrugue>	Ju_: that's from upgrading to feisty?
01:00	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: when the bootloader of the cd appears you must Press F6
01:00	<ju_>	antidrugue: yes, the very first day it was released
01:00	<Bonez56>	hi all, i'm getting an error when trying to start my X session. could someone please look at this and see if they can help? It looks fairly simple. Thanks! http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17007/
01:00	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, it's not the CD, I installed feisty with the desktop CD which worked fine.
01:00	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: its installed already ?
01:01	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: then press File booting ESC and e to edit the boot line of grub
01:01	<antidrugue>	Ju_: perhaps the module "evdev" is not loaded ?
01:02	<ju_>	antidrugue: how to I assert that
01:02	<ju_>	?
01:02	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. What I meant before, is that it's showing the same behavior as the alternate CD did.
01:02	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : you need 2 modules
01:02	<kevin_u_>	Is the wine package in synaptic when you install ubuntu 7.04?  because if its not i want to remove the package but i dont know how
01:02	<antidrugue>	Ju_: "sudo modprobe psmouse" and "sudo modprobe evdev"
01:02	<MoxJet>	What is the command to see which packages you have installed with aptitude?
01:02	<ju_>	antidrugue: done
01:02	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : then check out again in /proc/bus/input/devices
01:03	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: the live cd worked and the installation but the alternate doesn't ?
01:03	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, edit the recovery mode line which sais "kernel ....." and added "noacpi" after "ro single". Right?
01:03	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes, the live CD worked fine.
01:03	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: y
01:03	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can also cahnge ro single =>	in ro debug
01:03	<ju_>	antidrugue: the output is the same : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17009/ maybe I don't know how to spot it
01:04	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon;: then press b to boot
01:04	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, same problem with noacpi. The las line now is usually "[ <some number>]  usb 3-3: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
01:04	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you also added ro debug ?
01:05	<moDumass>	hmmm, how do i make torrent open torrent files?
01:05	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. same output
01:05	<kerb>	this is annoying, I could always just delete all the linux specific files before and install ubuntu, now I have to copy everything that's not partitioned off onto a secondary disk just so I can install ubuntu :/
01:06	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: is your pc a notebook ?
01:06	<moDumass>	by torrent i mean Ktorrent
01:06	<compengi>	MoxJet, try aptitude show
01:06	<potera>	esto q es
01:06	<antidrugue>	Ju_ : this guy seems to have the same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=410421
01:06	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, no. it works fine on my notebook from which I write to you!
01:07	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: you can tray nousb instead of noacpi
01:07	<MoxJet>	compengi no output from aptitude show
01:07	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I did a dist-upgrade from edgy which worked. now after a reinstall it doesn't.
01:07	<compengi>	MoxJet, read man aptitude
01:07	<YNWA>	How do I resize a partition using Gparted? It doesn't let me
01:08	<antidrugue>	Ju_: so adding "SendCoreEvents" should be the solution
01:08	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: after the distupgrade you have hdd to entries in grub for 2 different kernels , right ?
01:08	<velko>	YNWA, you started it as root?
01:08	<YNWA>	velko: please explain
01:08	<edlin>	wireless finally works for me in ubuntu hurray
01:08	<YNWA>	I clicked on it and it opened :)
01:08	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes, 2.6.17-something and 2.6.20-15. nousb gives the same result
01:08	<velko>	YNWA, "gksu gparted" or "sudo gparted" ?
01:09	<YNWA>	velko:it was more <system>-<administration>-<gparted>
01:09	<velko>	YNWA, did it asked for a password?
01:09	<YNWA>	yes
01:09	<frolle>	How do i search in a folder in the terminal?
01:10	<velko>	YNWA, ok so this is not the problem
01:10	<velko>	YNWA, what do you mean by "not letting me"?
01:10	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=415339 =>	your problem is known ..im still searching
01:10	<YNWA>	velko:is it true that I can only resize if I unmount?
01:10	<Stormx2>	frolle: What do you mean? Theres a few ways..
01:10	<velko>	YNWA, i guess so
01:11	<YNWA>	well, the "not letting me" bit is that it doesn't let me unmount the ext3 partition
01:11	<Zancat>	how much RAM would you guys recommend Feisty run on?
01:11	<BlueStorm>	does someone have Stepmania on linux?
01:11	<velko>	YNWA, so some program is using a file on this partition and therefore you can't unmount it
01:11	<impulse>	unfortunately still no luck with ATi driver
01:11	<surviver>	anyone that can help me with devilspie
01:11	<velko>	YNWA, you have to find out which program is this
01:11	<impulse>	followed the instrucions at ATI linux driver wiki
01:12	<YNWA>	I'm running ubuntu on it...? :)
01:12	<BlueStorm>	what's the command to see what is my graphic card?
01:12	<frolle>	Stormx2, i want to find some files on my hardrive.. i need to delete them
01:12	<velko>	YNWA, oho...
01:12	<Freduardo>	BlueStorm, lspci
01:12	<YNWA>	velko: it is the ext3 partition
01:12	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon do you have a SATA Harddrive ?
01:12	<velko>	YNWA, if this is your / or /home partition you have to do it from the livecd
01:12	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, no, IDE
01:13	<YNWA>	velko: oh, thanks :)
01:13	<neosb>	hey! wher can i find instalation folder of open office?
01:13	<ju_>	antidrugue: same error :( ...
01:13	<Stormx2>	frolle: You could use "locate" for that...
01:13	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: after the upgrade which option (in grub) did you choose to boot ?
01:13	<Stormx2>	frolle: Or "find"
01:13	<surviver>	!devilspie

01:13	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: the new one or the old one ?
01:13	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I did not change anything in grub then. No idea, what options were set.
01:14	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, the new one
01:14	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: and it worked ?
01:14	<rambo3>	!ext4
01:14	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ext4 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
01:14	<antidrugue>	Ju_: well i am a bit short of ideas now, perhaps you can read this for inspiration http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Synaptics_Touchpad
01:15	<Zancat>	man, the servers are STILL busy
01:15	<antidrugue>	Ju_: i know my touchpad didn't work after installing Feisty, but I just had to add the relevant section to my xorg.conf and it did afterwards, but your case seems more complicated
01:15	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, yes. New infos: after a long while it goes further than the USB. Now the last line is: [ 218.769080]  sd 0:0:0:3: Attached scsi generic sg3 type 0" and then the BusyBox line again.
01:16	<ju_>	antidrugue: ok, thanks for your help :)

01:17	<rambo3>	impulse, man depmod
01:17	<Lcarsdata>	Is there anyway to switch from debian to ubuntu?
01:17	<impulse>	rambo3, ty
01:18	<umop>	Lcarsdata, remove debian and install ubuntu
01:18	<Lcarsdata>	okay. :(
01:18	<moDumass>	!default
01:18	<ubotu>	To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties ->	Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror ->	Settings ->	Configure and then hit "File Associations"
01:18	<umop>	Lcarsdata, yeah, you can keep your home dir though i suppose
01:19	<Lcarsdata>	umop: don't have much though
01:19	<umop>	Lcarsdata, you will just want to keep not of what packages you had installed
01:19	<antidrugue>	Ju_: no problem, sorry we came short
01:19	<aatdark>	MonsieurBon: seems to be a strange issue . im sorry but i cant help you plz post your question again ..
01:19	<rambo3>	Lcarsdata, no
01:19	<umop>	Lcarsdata, fair enough.
01:19	<velko>	Lcarsdata, just curious - why would you want to do this?
01:19	<rambo3>	click and run i guess
01:19	<Lcarsdata>	velko: because debian isn't as good as ubuntu
01:20	<l4yer>	hi
01:20	<MonsieurBon>	aatdark, I might do a clean install of edgy with just the basic system and then dist-upgrade to feisty, to see if it works.
01:20	<l4yer>	how can I install xubuntu on ubuntu?^^"
01:20	<Lcarsdata>	velko: I tried ubuntu, then thought Debian was better then it turns out ubuntu was
01:20	<velko>	Lcarsdata, what do you mean by that?
01:20	<impulse>	hmm, why when i type in under root aticonfig --initial i get this: Found fglrx primary device section, Nothing to do, terminating.
01:20	<velko>	Lcarsdata, what is better. only short - i don't wont to get off topic

01:42	<sebusssss>	hello
01:42	<flowolf>	but I get an error boon and shutdown
01:42	<predaeus>	age6racer, as far as I know yes. But it is easier to install from the Desktop CD and you can also use it as a Live CD in case you need a boot CD if an error happens or if you just want to try out Ubuntu before installing.
01:43	<suntoucher>	Printing: I have a Canon i250, which is about two years old. Ubuntu only has a 550 and newer driver. Canon doesn't publish Linux drivers. Is there an easy solution?
01:43	<flowolf>	I don't understand why because the raid is working correctly
01:43	<DVS01>	i noticed something strange.. if i want to move a draggable object, like a window border or an icon on the desktop, there seems to be a delay between when i click and when its recognized as the start of dragging. i always have a habit of moving the mouse within 200ms of clicking. however, when i do that, the click isnt caught and i end up 'missing' what i was trying to drag/resize, because i move the mouse the instant that i click. is there a 
01:43	<IdleOne>	suntoucher, nope
01:43	<predaeus>	age6racer, the alternate cd uses less resources while installing so that it will install on systems that are low on resources.
01:43	<predaeus>	age6racer, and also allows some extra options I think, but that's only expert stuff.

01:48	<Cam30077>	It gets to the flash screen fine, loads the desktop fine, and starts the installer fine.
01:48	<DrZoot>	quick question, what is the gcc used to compile ubuntu 7.04? or better yet, if i am recompiling a deb package on 7.04 which gcc should i use?
01:48	<Cam30077>	But when i get to the "Starting Partitioner" step (5 of 6)  the computer crashes when its "reading file systems"

01:54	<r00tintheb0x>	makuseru, it still saves it localy.
01:54	<Impaque>	gandalfcome: port range is not any different than, say, single port. iprange is the name of the iptables module. then, you mark those packets, which in turn, you shape with tc.

01:54	<riccardo>	it's not... guides tell you 2 ways to install the new 8.36 drivers: manual (making all the packages... been there on my previous edgy installation, would rather wait) or "the ubuntu way"... they just enable repos that i already have, do a apt update and then they get the new drivers... i don't think they're lying, are they?
01:54	<gandalfcome>	Impaque: can you give me an example?
01:54	<slackern>	fenrig, are you thinking of gparted?

01:55	<Cam30077>	gparted was its name.   Do you know where i can get it.  Might be a bit better than win 98 one

02:00	<slackern>	libcairomm-1.0-1 , libglibmm-2.4-1c2a , libgtkmm-2.4-1c2a , gparted are the packages needed to install gparted
02:00	<nex>	is it possible to config the lines ? I want to use a "quick launchbar"" and a taskbar just under ..
02:00	<dunstabulos_>	Cam30077, IdleOne: gparted has several dependencies not in the default ubuntu
02:00	<Impaque>	gandalfcome: just read this http://www.docum.org/docum.org/docs/BB/BB.php and it should be pretty clear afterwards.
02:00	<spikeb>	might be
02:00	<spikeb>	too lazy to find out though
02:00	<spikeb>	heh
02:00	<IdleOne>	dunstabulos_, then he needs to install those depends also

02:11	<jrib>	!alternate >	brandon^    (brandon^, see the private message from ubotu)
02:11	<coNP>	nex_: get a new gnome panel and drag it wher do you want to have irt
02:12	<Dave2>	Samuli^, just drag it out from the side
02:12	<Baktaah>	r00tintheb0x  already done as it says there

02:12	<BlueStorm>	zeroday, dapper :/
02:12	<orbin>	can anyone give me a hand with ndiswrapper?  i think i've got my settings right: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16990/  but nm-applet just keeps spinning then eventually fails when i try to connect - except for a couple of times when it's randomly worked.

02:12	<brandon^>	Is that on the live cd?
02:12	<Samuli^>	Dave2, got it. I tried that before (while in metacity), and it didn't work, but works fine now in beryl.
02:12	<sand_storm>	ScottSatkin : i got a long list, does that mean it is installed?
02:12	<r00tintheb0x>	Baktaah, doubtful.
02:12	<Z__>	any one here have ati 9600
02:12	<r00tintheb0x>	trol0s_, =) ;)
02:12	<Baktaah>	r00tintheb0x  no I HAVE
02:12	<orbin>	nex_: start menu? :P
02:12	<SharkyPL>	I have a question about Wine, can somebody help me?
02:12	<jrib>	trol0s_: you shouldn't download things yourself when you install, use the repositories
02:12	<nex_>	yeah
02:13	<zeroday>	bluestorm: not sure for dapper sorry you could try alberto milones envy script
02:13	<nex_>	main menu
02:13	<MacPointMan>	yes that is already done with Easy Ubuntu.
02:13	<IndyGunFreak>	SharkyPL: just ask your question, don't ask to ask it.
02:13	<r00tintheb0x>	Baktaah, then open a terminal window.
02:13	<idefixx>	Samuli^: its to the right just move your mouse over and pull it away from the windows border
02:13	<nex_>	the ubuntu icon to access to the menu
02:13	<r00tintheb0x>	and type "java -V"
02:13	<trol0s_>	jrib: yeah I used Synaptic
02:13	<r00tintheb0x>	and paste the results in http://pastebin.ca for me.
02:13	<zeroday>	macpointman: Do dvd's work now
02:13	<r00tintheb0x>	im sorry
02:13	<Z__>	Any one got an ati 9600, 9600 pro or xt card ??
02:13	<A[D] minS>	!evolution
02:13	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about evolution - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
02:13	<jrib>	trol0s_: k, then you probably want just "unrar" as "unrar-free" can't open recent rar files
02:13	<superhubert>	yo bros
02:13	<superhubert>	I'm trying to set up my wireless card in my iBook G4. anyone know what to do?
02:13	<ScottSatkin>	sand_storm: that means you file is extracted, you downloaded a tar file which is like a zip, it contains a directory with many files... it has simply been extracted, not installed... what exactly did you download?
02:14	<r00tintheb0x>	Baktaah, "java -version"
02:14	<r00tintheb0x>	not java -V
02:14	<SharkyPL>	well, I was thinking: could I just copy everything from my windows partition to .wine/drive_c ? would it go better, would it start more applications? would I have to check every library in winecfg ->	libraries as native?
02:14	<infbliss>	hi all can somebody tell me what is the command to invoke hibernate in ubuntu
02:14	<sand_storm>	ScottSatkin : an emulator for ps2
02:14	<trol0s_>	jrib: but I probably won't we willing to pay for it :P
02:14	<zeroday>	infbliss: you should use the power button in the panel
02:14	<brandon^>	 Is the ALTERNATE CD install contained on the LIVE CD?
02:15	<jrib>	brandon^: no, seperate download
02:15	<Impaque>	brandon^: no.
02:15	<brandon^>	fuck
02:15	<LjL>	trol0s_: eh?! if it's in the repositories, you don't pay for it. whatever it is
02:15	<LjL>	!language | brandon^
02:15	<ubotu>	brandon^: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
02:15	<brandon^>	i dont have another cd
02:15	<nex_>	no one :/
02:15	<IndyGunFreak>	SharkyPL: i highly doubt that would work.
02:15	<trol0s_>	LjL: why is it listed as non-free then.. a trial?
02:15	<ScottSatkin>	sand_storm: is there an install or config or readme file in the files you extracted?
02:15	<jrib>	brandon^: you tried the "safe mode" (can't remember the exact language) on the live cd?
02:15	<LjL>	!free >	trol0s_    (trol0s_, see the private message from Ubotu)
02:15	<infbliss>	zeroday: is not there a command which i can enter in the command line
02:15	<brandon^>	no
02:16	<jrib>	brandon^: give that a try then
02:16	<SharkyPL>	IndyGunFreak - why? there are lots of dlls which aren't included in wine, don't you think?
02:16	<brandon^>	Can i install in safe mode, and then run the regular version?
02:16	<zeroday>	infbliss: not sure  you could try shutdown --help
02:16	<trol0s_>	LjL: hehe okey thanks for the tip
02:16	<superhubert>	iBook wireless setup. Anyone? Anyone?
02:16	<IndyGunFreak>	SharkyPL: why did you ask for help if you were already convinced it should work?
02:16	<IkimashoZ>	man, I was going to ask about how to get Ubuntu to write to my ntfs external HD, but I have to be getting to bed.  Oh well.  Some other time maybe
02:16	<LjL>	trol0s_: in free software terms, "non-free" means that something isn't released under an open source license that allows free modification and redistribution of modified code. it may sometimes also mean patent encumbered software. means the former, in this case
02:16	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  what brand?
02:16	<superhubert>	...apple
02:17	<IdleOne>	morning LjL
02:17	<A[D] minS>	how i can take backup from my mails "am working with evolution "
02:17	<brandon^>	Can i install in safe mode, and then run the regular version?
02:17	<superhubert>	what do you mean?
02:17	<zeroday>	brandon: yes
02:17	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  you wireless card
02:17	<MacPointMan>	working on it now.  My internet connection is somewhat li=mited
02:17	<SharkyPL>	IndyGunFreak - because I want to know if it will work, and how itwill work, because I don't really have any partition, and installing WinXP to try if it works with wine would take lots of time, especially adding the libraries in Winecfg ->	Libraries
02:17	<sand_storm>	ScottSatkin : no
02:17	<LjL>	trol0s_: you won't find *anything* in the official Ubuntu repositories that you actually have to pay for. you may at worst find stuff (such as the MP3 codecs) that, in certain jurisdiction at least, you're in theory required to pay royalties for to the patent holder
02:17	<brandon^>	k trying, probably brb
02:17	<superhubert>	it's the built in airport one
02:17	<IndyGunFreak>	SharkyPL: it will work awesome, give it a try
02:17	<SharkyPL>	any partition with Windows*
02:17	<sand_storm>	ScottSatkin : i will check with the people who made it..
02:17	<[gloom] >	does anyone know if it's possible to use xinerama (or some other app) to extend the desktop with two screens over LAN?
02:17	<MacPointMan>	But before I made the change DVDs were able to mount and play
02:17	<LjL>	hi IdleOne
02:18	<ScottSatkin>	sand_storm: every program you download off the web is different, look on the website you got if from for instructions on how to install/run it
02:18	<trol0s_>	LjL: I see. Thanks very much. I'm new to this as you can understand :)
02:18	<r00tintheb0x>	[gloom] , im not sure but interesting question.
02:18	<SharkyPL>	IndyGunFreak - you said you doubt it will work... I'm confused now. / Do I _really_ have to set _every_ library in Winecfg->Libraries?
02:18	<omkar86>	hi how to make xubuntu look like Mac OS X?

02:19	<Baktaah>	r00tintheb0x  and it downloaded and installed
02:19	<orbin>	can anyone give me a hand with ndiswrapper?  i think i've got my settings right: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16990/  but nm-applet just keeps spinning then eventually fails when i try to connect - except for a couple of times when it's randomly worked.

02:20	<muxx>	gloom: check xdmx. might be what you want
02:20	<aatdark>	<superhubert>	pastebi is a website where you can poste text and get an unique url for it. This url you can paste here then

02:20	<omkar86>	btw which is the best suitable laptop brand for linux?
02:20	<IndyGunFreak>	lol

02:21	<r00tintheb0x>	I just have never done it.
02:21	<jrib>	surviver: did you put it in the right place?
02:21	<IndyGunFreak>	omkar86: as long as it uses Nvidia graphics, i think most of them would owrk.
02:21	<effie_jayx>	omkar86,  try system76 :D
02:21	<imon9>	velko: i have emeral running, but it doesnt seems to do anything to my configuration

02:22	<tatters>	My screen saver is always blank (feisty , KDE )  screen yet when I test it works fine ?
02:22	<IndyGunFreak>	omkar86: unless you buy a laptop with Linux on it, its highly unlikely you'll get linux drivers packaged with it.

02:23	<Baktaah>	jrib  nothing

02:25	<[gloom] >	muxx: yes, but xdmx seems to be a different x server. I'd like to do it on top of standard xorg 7.1. Maybe telling in the xorg that the second display is _ip_:0.0 or smth like that. Don't know if that's supported...
02:25	<aatdark>	<OiPenguinn>	what programm do you use to chagne the file ?
02:25	<sc0tch>	Fibrewire: I had noticed the same thing, just be patient and it will continue.. (there was a long several minute pause before continuing on a laptop install I did, it also does not increment past 15%, just jumps quickly after that.
02:25	<superhubert>	effie_jayx: ahuh! so how do I set it up? (I'm a newbie, by the way)
02:26	<aatdark>	<OiPenguinn>	gedit or nano ?
02:26	<velko>	OiPenguinn, if you used dpkg-reconfigure for that the directory /etc/X11 contains the backup

02:28	<MacPointMan>	I am not sure exactly what the syntax should be.  Here is that line in my Fstab.  /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf, iso9660, user,noauto     0       0

02:28	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  cool ... after that your card shoulhd be scanning for networks

02:29	<Baktaah>	theme
02:29	<zeroday>	MenZaDK: do u hav a nvidia card?
02:29	<jrib>	surviver: your fifrefox.ds says "application-name" instead of "application_name"
02:29	<MenZaDK>	See, that's another thing, my terminals are illegible. I can't use gnome-terminal
02:30	<superhubert>	effie_jayx: it prompted me to fetch and extract firmware within the "details" terminal in synaptics... is this normal?
02:30	<MenZaDK>	Yes, zeroday, NVIDIA GeForce 7950GT
02:30	<velko>	MenZaDK, Alt+F2 ?
02:30	<zeroday>	menZaDK: Known issue
02:30	<crazy_penguin>	ompaul: around?
02:30	<MenZaDK>	zeroday: ah
02:30	<MenZaDK>	Any fix?

02:31	<Stormx2>	sourceforge is down? o.O
02:31	<velko>	MacPointMan, did you tried my suggestion about "udf"?
02:31	<BlueEagle>	predaeus: It happens. :)
02:31	<superhubert>	effie_jayx: do I have to run that package, or has it done it's thing already from synaptics?
02:32	<Fiberwire>	can someone please tell me why the ubuntu installation freezes at 15% when i try to install it onto the hard drive of my Playstation 3 from the live cd?
02:32	<MenZaDK_>	zeroday: alright, what was it again? X went haywire.
02:32	<YNWA>	can anyone PLEASE help with how to get windows to appear on GRUB?

02:32	<Shafto>	!dualboot >	YNWA
02:32	<jrib>	surviver: then it is working

02:32	<ompaul>	crazy_penguin, kinda busy
02:32	<crazy_penguin>	ompaul: may i pm you?
02:32	<MacPointMan>	this is what it looked like.  I changed it to put the udf after iso9660 but not exactly what the syntax should be exactly.  /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf, iso9660, user,noauto     0       0
02:32	<surviver>	jrib, nope i tested it i talked to someone his answer came on my first screen
02:32	<ompaul>	feel free to do so -- I might be gone a min or two
02:32	<crazy_penguin>	i need only a few seconds of your time ompaul please
02:33	<Brucevdk>	Could somebody point me to some documentation describing the Module section in xorg.conf, I read the manpage but it doesn't discuss the modules.
02:33	<BlueEagle>	ynwa: First open your /boot/grub/menu.lst and paste that to pastebin.
02:33	<BlueEagle>	!pastebin | ynwa
02:33	<ubotu>	ynwa: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
02:33	<effie_jayx>	superhubert, it should be done... check to see if the led for the wireless card works noe
02:33	<Baktaah>	jrib i got java version 1.6
02:33	<superhubert>	I applied it in synaptics, and part of it installing was "fetching and extract firmware"
02:33	<Baktaah>	(after typing java -version)
02:33	<jrib>	surviver: then the im window does not have the application name you chose.  Close devilspie (ctrl-c) and start it again in debug mode with  devilspie -d
02:33	<velko>	MacPointMan, you have space after the , and before iso9660 and before user. lose them
02:33	<MenZa>	zeroday: alright
02:33	<Baktaah>	jrib  but still doesnt work
02:33	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  try clicking on the network monitor icon next ot the clok... that should tell you if it is scanning anything
02:34	<Fiberwire>	i need help.... the ubuntu installation (from liveCD to HDD) on my Playstation 3 keeps freezing at 15%... anyone kow why?

02:34	<Fiberwire>	i just installed the kboot loader and got ubuntu running from the live cd and now i want to install it to the HDD, but the installer freezes at 15%
02:35	<BlueEagle>	!ps3

02:35	<MacPointMan>	ok done do I need to reboot or do I need to just try my DVD
02:35	<MenZa>	zeroday: I'll just restart X first, so I can c/p it
02:35	<YNWA>	BlueEagle: righty-o
02:35	<TigerWolf>	!color
02:35	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about color - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
02:35	<velko>	MacPointMan, you don't have to reboot
02:35	<zeroday>	Menza: now go to devices and add Option     AddARGBGLXVisuals "True"
02:35	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  what kind of protection do you use for you wireless card? wep ... wpa?
02:35	<MacPointMan>	oh yea thats windows isnt it

02:37	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  if you were using wep... you would know...
02:37	<YNWA>	done
02:37	<BlueEagle>	ynwa: That should list out all partitions on your system. Paste that information to pastebin.
02:37	<|ringo|>	superhubert: ...you shouldnt go with wep period
02:37	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  I'm guessing you are not using any kind of protection
02:37	<superhubert>	their the two options in the network setup
02:38	<MacPointMan>	mount: only root can mount /dev/scd0 on /media/cdrom0
02:38	<Fiberwire>	i need help.... the ubuntu installation (from liveCD to HDD) on my Playstation 3 keeps freezing at 15%... anyone know why? I just installed the kboot loader on the other partition of the HDD and got ubuntu running off the liveCD, but when i tryed installing it, it just got up to 15% (detecting file systems) and stopped.
02:38	<MacPointMan>	thats my error

=== coNP_ is now known as coNP
02:39	<MenZa>	There is an article on the wiki, Fiberwire
02:39	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  what you are doing is configuring the network manually... (I don't know if yourcard can already scan)
02:39	<gogeta>	xbox scene in the ps3 fourms has a guide
02:40	<MenZa>	http://help.ubuntu.com/community/PlayStation_3 I think
02:40	<MacPointMan>	velko sorry it has been years since I have used IRC.

02:40	<BlueEagle>	ynwa: So is windows installed on /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1?
02:40	<YNWA>	/dev/sda1
02:40	<velko>	MacPointMan, i don't understand your last point
02:40	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  that should help see what networks are around
02:41	<BlueEagle>	ynwa: Ok. Hang on while I remember the syntax here. :)
02:41	<miranda82>	hello
02:41	<velko>	MacPointMan, yes it is
02:41	<MacPointMan>	Velko I was just apologising for my ineptitude in IRC.  It has been years since I have used it.  I thank you for your help.  is the group cdrom a seperate IRC room
02:42	<MenZa>	zeroday: so... Option<tab>AddARGBLXVisuals<tab>"True" ?
02:42	<YNWA>	no probs... as long as there is some way, i'm halfway happy :), when that works, i'm fully happy :-D
02:42	<miranda82>	does anyone know, why if i do: apt-get install linux-686 it installs correctly, but i still don't have the option (and it is not under /boot) to load the 686 kernel?
02:42	<tarelerulz>	When I have doing a command and I put something  with an " and I don't put one at the other end I get >	and then all I can do is type
02:42	<velko>	MacPointMan, no. it's a user group on your own pc
02:42	<MacPointMan>	Velko thank you I will go there.  Thank you for your help
02:42	<superhubert>	effie_jayx: I can see the one I want to connect to. It's got a padlock icon next to it

02:42	<MenZa>	zeroday: 2s
02:42	<zeroday>	menza: under devices

02:43	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,   ok... but what password is it... you can log in to wep keys no problem with wifi radar
02:43	<MenZa>	zeroday: yes, the same as my graphics card
02:43	<velko>	MacPointMan, type "groups" in a terminal window and see if one of the words reads "cdrom"
02:43	<alexises>	hi
02:43	<MacPointMan>	ok Cdrom is a user group on my pc.  I got to figure out how to get there then
02:43	<rtsln>	hi
02:43	<zeroday>	menza: correct
02:43	<MenZa>	It complains that "True" isn't a valid keyword.
02:43	<rtsln>	i forgot my root password :(
02:43	<MenZa>	(in that section)
02:43	<effie_jayx>	superhubert,  and your card is scanning ... which is good
02:43	<rtsln>	and i want it changed.
02:43	<superhubert>	effie_jayx: so I just create a profile...?
02:43	<rtsln>	how is this done?
02:43	<Fiberwire>	the article on the wiki didn't address the issue im haing....
02:44	<xMorgawr>	if somebody here programs with gtk+ 2.0, could you pm me? i need help with a dialog window, i can't make it kill both the main window and the dialog with a single button, help please
02:44	<rtsln>	sudo passwd didn't help

02:44	<rtsln>	anybody?

02:45	<YNWA>	blueEagle: I'll give it a try, thanks

03:20	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about touch screen - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
03:20	<jikanter>	hey, is their an authoritative source for documentation on typical changes made to the debian python policy for ubuntu (if there are any)?
03:20	<antidrugue>	bliz0r: just type "apt-get install gitcore"
03:20	<Gigi>	!touch
03:20	<Shironeko>	does anyone know something about sound problems in Feisty Fawn?
03:20	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about touch - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
03:20	<stefg>	tom1502: the kernel dev's couldn't decide up to last minute wether to use libata or not... that means your devices g back and forth from /s/ da to /h/ da.... so everything is UUID based now
03:21	<cramm>	gaa, now I know why there are no .jigdo files for the feisty i386|amd64 desktop CDs
03:21	<MacPointMan>	Velko yes here is how that line looks.  /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660,user,noauto     0       0
03:21	<Shironeko>	my sound stopped working after the upgrade...
03:21	<retarded>	anyone installed ubuntu with the alternate cd ??
03:21	<velko>	jikanter, yes. finaly they did it! pycentral is in ubuntu too
03:21	<antidrugue>	bliz0r : oups i mean  "apt-get install git-core"
03:21	<aleix>	retarded: I did...
03:21	<jikanter>	velko: right on, thanks a ton
03:21	<antidrugue>	retarded: i did
03:21	<stefg>	!UUID
03:21	<ubotu>	To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell:  blkid  (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
03:21	<erUSUL>	bliz0r: why not just 'sudo apt-get install git-c*'
03:21	<erUSUL>	?
03:21	<velko>	MacPointMan, replace the comma between iso9660 and user with a space
03:21	<LjL>	Gigi: perhaps start at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HildonDesktopForUbuntu
03:21	<retarded>	did it solve all the problems antidrugue  and aleix  ??
03:21	<tom1502>	stefg well but grub always uses the wrong uuid's...
03:22	<antidrugue>	retarded: which problems?
03:22	<tom1502>	stefg, from hd(0,2) instead of hd(0,3)
03:22	<aleix>	retarded: no problems here...
03:22	<MacPointMan>	ok lets try that
03:22	<ravenoust>	hey
03:22	<tiger_>	hey
03:22	<retarded>	x server on boot .. it doesnt run with the regular cd
03:22	<stefg>	tom UUID is something different... read above what ubotu spit out
03:22	<antidrugue>	retarted: which video do you have?
03:22	<tom1502>	stefg, i know
03:22	<Gigi>	Ljl ty

03:22	<retarded>	ATI X 1450
03:22	<magnetron>	tom1502: always? grub NEVER works?
03:22	<ravenoust>	I installed xmail, and now i want to remove it, but i cant find it anywhere...does anyone have any tips?
03:23	<velko>	jikanter,  http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/
03:23	<antidrugue>	retarded: i guess it could
03:23	<ghaaly>	how do I connect to a wireless using a shared password within the iwconfig command
03:23	<tom1502>	stefg, but as i dont know the uuid of my /dev/hda4 by heart, i used the grub "word"
03:23	<n1mr0d>	I'm having a sound problem with sound in Feisty Fawn...I've got an onboard nforce interface and 2 pchd5500 cards that use cx88_alsa...the problem is the cards keep switching order every time I reboot...it's a dice roll which comes up first, the onboard or the pci cards...
03:23	<jikanter>	velko, thanks
03:23	<LjL>	ravenoust: you installed it via APT, of course?
03:23	<ghaaly>	how do I connect to a wireless using a shared password within the iwconfig command
03:23	<ravenoust>	yeah
03:23	<LjL>	ravenoust: then just type  sudo apt-get remove xmail 
03:23	<ravenoust>	i installed it with sudo apt
03:23	<valehru__>	anyone know what package the application aoss is in?
03:23	<ak__>	can so tell me how to ACTIVATE compize plugins in gconf-editor ?
03:23	<valehru__>	!aoss
03:23	<ravenoust>	cool
03:23	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about aoss - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
03:23	<ravenoust>	thnx
03:23	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: a shared password? wep?
03:23	<ghaaly>	how do I connect to a wireless using a shared password within the iwconfig command
03:23	<ghaaly>	!wireless
03:23	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
03:23	<MacPointMan>	Velko thank you.  that was a great help.  Now all I have to do is fix the choppy playback
03:24	<tom1502>	magnetron not until i change the uuids to /dev/hda4
03:24	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: "man iwconfig"
03:24	<retarded>	im fairly dissapoint . edgy installed as a charm .. to be honnest i recommended a hand full of friends to wait for the feisty release to install .. i hope they wont run in the same problem .. it really gives a bad feeling
03:24	<velko>	MacPointMan, is dma enabled for the cdrom/dvdrom device?
03:24	<MacPointMan>	Notsure how to check that.  thats how I messed it up last time
03:24	<antidrugue>	retarded: i'm sure the alternate CD will work fine
03:24	<linxeh>	what is the best ipod management software? ephpod ?
03:24	<^^kalm>	n1mr0d: hey one thing that MIGHT help is recompiling your kernel and configure it to use the PCI card and not the onboard...
03:24	<moDumass>	hey all, is there something like iCal for ubuntu?
03:24	<retarded>	ok
03:25	<grok_linux>	changed resolution to 1024x768 and i now have to "scroll" the screen around. is there some checkbox that needs to be checked so that the monitor changes mode as well?
03:25	<retarded>	then ill download that one :) ty antdrugue
03:25	<bliz0r>	erUSUL Errors were encountered while processing:

03:25	<magnetron>	moDumass: like a calender? try evolution
03:25	<stefg>	evolution
03:25	<bliz0r>	why do i get that?
03:25	<^^kalm>	n1mr0d: there might be an easier way to do it, but not a one that i know of
03:25	<antidrugue>	retarded: it is worth a try, good luck
03:25	<lobosque>	how do i execute a .sh file?
03:25	<linxeh>	moDumass: sunbird? evolution?
03:25	<n1mr0d>	^^kalm: I need all three...I just need to force the order...I guess I could compile the one that needs to be 0 into the kernel
03:25	<velko>	MacPointMan,  "sudo hdparm /dev/whatever" will show you the info
03:25	<LjL>	lobosque: ./filename.sh  after having chmod +x 'ed it
03:25	<antidrugue>	lobosque: sh yourfile.sh
03:25	<MacPointMan>	velko sorry I am not real sure on how to do that.  the commands I used last time to chsck that Broke my DVD drive
03:25	<moDumass>	sunbird?
03:25	<stefg>	lobosque: sh foo.sf
03:25	<linxeh>	moDumass: from the mozilla foundation
03:25	<aleix>	ghaaly: sudo iwconfig wlan0 key FEFEFEFEFE
03:25	<MacPointMan>	velko thus forcing me to fix it.
03:25	<LjL>	lobosque: but if you're installing a program, have you checked if there's not a package for it in the repositories first?
03:26	<^^kalm>	n1mr0d: yeah you can try
03:26	<linxeh>	moDumass: like thunderbird / firefox
03:26	<antidrugue>	sunbird, or online with google calendar
03:26	<lobosque>	LjL is just a little script
03:26	<assasukasse>	someone uses readahead?
03:26	<assasukasse>	is useful?
03:26	<^^kalm>	just save your old config file somewhere else before having a go at recompiling
03:26	<ak__>	plz can so tell me how to ACTIVATE compize plugins in gconf-editor ?
03:26	<antidrugue>	stefg: did you jump the fence to ubuntu?
03:26	<_hik>	hi all. Where do I find the default icon sets for ubuntu?
03:26	<LjL>	assasukasse, readahead is used by default
03:26	<Phineas>	Hey guys, I'm not able to write to my ntfs partitions. I've got ntfs-3g installed and I have ntfs-config but it isn't letting me tick the box for internal drives. Only external. Any ideas?
03:26	<^^kalm>	_hik: /usr/share/icons/
03:26	<stefg>	antidrugue: ???
03:26	<velko>	MacPointMan, you don't need to chsck (whatever that means). hdparm will tell you if you have enabled dma. choppy playback may be the result of dma off
03:27	<assasukasse>	LjL: i wish to know how it goes if u disable by default
03:27	<antidrugue>	stefg: didn't i saw you on #debian a couple of times?
03:27	<assasukasse>	LjL: because i also have prelink installed, but seems that i don't have that much speed change..
03:27	<LjL>	assasukasse: never tried disabling it, but i'm quite 100% sure that things just go slower, and no advantages
03:27	<MacPointMan>	velko sorry typo i meant Check
03:27	<Phineas>	!fuse
03:27	<ubotu>	Though it's still very unsafe, you can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing using fuse here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
03:27	<_hik>	cheers. actually thought I looked there but I can't have
03:27	<assasukasse>	LjL: u have prelink also?
03:27	<LjL>	assasukasse, readahead only intervenes during boot, nothing else
03:27	<The_wrath>	So...Anyone wanna tell me where the "vertical bar" key is?
03:27	<LjL>	assasukasse: no, i have preload though
03:27	<antidrugue>	stefg: (sorry, my english sounds weird sometimes)
03:27	<stefg>	antidrugue: no, you must confuse me... hang out there sometimes, but not often
03:27	<jrib>	The_wrath: this: | ?
03:28	<assasukasse>	LjL: on feisty?
03:28	<The_wrath>	jrib: thats it Ive been looking and dont see it )=
03:28	<velko>	The_wrath, this depends on your keyboard layout
03:28	<assasukasse>	i can't even find the package..
03:28	<ghaaly_>	how do I connect to a wireless using a shared password within the iwconfig command
03:28	<antidrugue>	stefg: oh, ok
03:28	<Desmaano>	hey guys, is there a tool to remove all the folders, leaving the files only ???
03:28	<LjL>	assasukasse: yes, though i brought it with me from edgy
03:28	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, iwconfig eth1 key < is using a generated keys and not a shared password
03:28	<LjL>	!info preload | assasukasse, you have universe enabled?
03:28	<ubotu>	assasukasse, you have universe enabled?: preload: adaptive readahead daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.4-3 (feisty), package size 33 kB, installed size 172 kB
03:28	<The_wrath>	velko: maybe mine doesnt have one than )=
03:28	<jrib>	The_wrath: hmm, depends on your keyboard.  mine is above Enter and the symbol on the keyboard is actually broken in half
03:28	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: with WPA ?
03:29	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: why would you want to use iwconfig anyway?
03:29	<cubex>	hello everyone
03:29	<assasukasse>	LjL: oh yea i have it installed, i forgot about it :D
03:29	<MacPointMan>	Velko yes DMA is enabled here is what it looks like.#/dev/cdroms/cdrom0 {
03:29	<MacPointMan>	#	dma = on		
03:29	<MacPointMan>	#	interrupt_unmask = on
03:29	<MacPointMan>	#	io32_support = 0
03:29	<MacPointMan>	#}
03:29	<LjL>	assasukasse, if your installation has gone though a few upgrade, you might want to try re-generating the readahead list, by putting the "profile" option temporarily in the kernel parameters (can do that at GRUB menu)
03:29	<LjL>	!paste >	MacPointMan    (MacPointMan, see the private message from Ubotu)
03:29	<linxeh>	The_wrath: on my UK laptop keyboard  it is on the backtick key, below escape (I get to it with alt-gr + key)
03:29	<linxeh>	The_wrath: what keyboard do you have ?
03:29	<^^kalm>	assasukasse: why wouldnt you use iwconfig?
03:29	<exzrael>	How come does sudo work but not su? I always see that its not doable.
03:29	<cubex>	i have a problem with my sound card. it's an intel snd-hda-intel. the sound comes from the headphones, but not on the laptop speakers
03:29	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, do you have something else to use ?
03:29	<tom1502>	stefg, do you think the problem might be that i use "root=/dev/hda4" instead of the uuid?
03:29	<cubex>	any tips please?
03:29	<The_wrath>	linxeh: Thanks, found it. They didnt label it on mine for some reason
03:30	<assasukasse>	LjL: i did install beta 4 and upgraded from then
03:30	<LjL>	assasukasse: i really doubt that readahead has much to do with the poor performance increase from prelink. you know, prelink and preload are the kind of things that some people swear on, and other people say they didn't notice any difference
03:30	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: well, network manager
03:30	<velko>	MacPointMan, ok. but sorry - i have no further ideas how to improve the playback. maybe try another player?
03:30	<linxeh>	exzrael: by default ubuntu doesnt use the root account, so you cannot su to root. you can su to other users though
03:30	<stefg>	tom1502: yeak, that's the problem
03:30	<LjL>	assasukasse: in that case, a profile won't hurt - though, don't expect *huge* boot-time improvements
03:30	<MacPointMan>	Velko.  Thank you for your help.  I really appreciate it.
03:30	<linxeh>	The_wrath: odd - i've never seen a keyboard without the pipe symbol
03:30	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: which version of ubuntu are you using?
03:30	<velko>	MacPointMan, np
03:30	<tarelerulz>	I want to remote login into kde's login manager how do I do that?
03:30	<tom1502>	stefg, how can i find out the correct uuid?
03:30	<linxeh>	The_wrath: sometimes it is two vertical bars stacked on top of each other
03:30	<assasukasse>	LjL: so i should just add option profile on grub menu.lst?
03:30	<MacPointMan>	Velko I think It has something to do with a Beryl Setting.  Ill have to check it out.
03:30	<stefg>	!UUID | tom1502
03:31	<ubotu>	tom1502: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell:  blkid  (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
03:31	<tom1502>	stefg, i dont know udev wery well
03:31	<Desmaano>	guys, can i remove all the folders leaving only the files ??
03:31	<The_wrath>	linxeh: it shows the backslash but doesnt have the vertical bar above it like it should
03:31	<moDumass>	<linxeh>	how would i install this sunbird?
03:31	<LjL>	assasukasse: no need to add it to menu.lst. just reboot, and at the GRUB menu, select your kernel, hit "e", select the kernel line, hit "e" again, add "profile" (after "nosplash quiet"), and hit "b" to boot
03:31	<^^kalm>	Should i use fixed font for the console or VGA?
03:31	<antidrugue>	moDumass: with synaptic
03:31	<ghaaly_>	password type hexadecimal or plain ASCCI
03:31	<linxeh>	moDumass: there is stuff in the forums / wiki on it - unfortunately I dont think there is a package for it yet
03:31	<LjL>	assasukasse: boot will be a lot slower than usual, since readahead will kick in and profile accessed files. then subsequent boots should be faster
03:31	<assasukasse>	well i do it now then thanks

03:32	<thirdalbum>	I get a kernel panic in the guest OS when attempting to boot the Feisty Alternate CD in Virtualbox - has anyone else come across this problem?
03:32	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: depends of your password
03:32	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, Hexadecimal or plain ASCII

03:32	<kerb>	what gconf key do I have to set so I can run compiz and have <Control>1-4 desktop switching?
03:32	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, its a shared passwod

03:32	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: We know better :)
03:32	<ochosi>	hi, can anyone give me  a hand with getting my laptop (with ati x1400) to work with feisty? xserver just wont start and since i wanted to reinstall the xorg-drivers-fglrx package i removed it and now i can't add it anymore cuase he says he can't find the package
03:32	<moDumass>	<antidrugue>	yeh im kinda strugling to get synaptic to install it
03:32	<tom1502>	stefg, do you know why the "whatever" creates the menu.lst takes the wrong partition?
03:32	<magnetron>	when asking the ubotu bot about something for yourself, use /msg ubotu !keyword
03:32	<antidrugue>	if your password is composed of numbers and letters from A to E, then it's HEXADECIMAL
03:32	<Desmaano>	im not a windows hater, but windows just erased like 40 gb of personal files :(
03:33	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: Bad luck... Virus?
03:33	<antidrugue>	moDumass: well isn't there a sunbird package in there?
03:33	<ghaaly_>	antidrugue, ???
=== ghaaly_ is now known as ghaaly
03:33	<Desmaano>	and i recovered most of them, but its spreaded out in 1000's of folders
03:33	<Desmaano>	no, windows diskcleaner
03:33	<stefg>	tom1502: you shifted partitions around, didn't you?
03:33	<ghaaly>	antidrugue, Its a shared password
03:33	<Desmaano>	thought it were all temporary files :\
03:33	<mr_daniel>	ochosi: are you using synaptic ?
03:33	<velko>	kerb, the control key is called <Control>	in the metacity gconf properties
03:33	<psycop>	anyone here know how i get cedega to run wow that is allready installed on my ntfs partition?
03:33	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: you are just not clear about it, a shared password doesn't mean anything

03:33	<eliran>	Hello
03:33	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: Microsoft is evil :)
03:34	<ochosi>	mr_daniel: gdm doesnt start, so apt-get from the tty
03:34	<antidrugue>	ghaaly: so it is shared instead of open, so it is WEP ?
03:34	<Desmaano>	indeed it is, but what can i do now ? :(
03:34	<tom1502>	stefg, not at all, i have this since edgy
03:34	<ghaaly>	antidrugue, how do I determine
03:34	<Desmaano>	how can i ever get my files back ? :\
03:34	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: Start searching those folders
03:34	<ghaaly>	antidrugue, yes its a web
03:34	<mr_daniel>	ochosi: do you have updated your package list ?
03:34	<Desmaano>	the thousands of them ? :\
03:34	<antidrugue>	well, you can try the possibilities in network manager
03:34	<jrib>	Desmaano: have you tried ##windows?
03:34	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: it was a joke
03:34	<magnetron>	psycop: Wow works very well i Wine too, which is included in Ubuntu
03:34	<antidrugue>	try either hexacimal or ascii
03:35	<mr_daniel>	ochosi: try 'sudo apt-get update'
03:35	<antidrugue>	it'll just take a minute
03:35	<ochosi>	mr_daniel: already tried that
03:35	<^^kalm>	Desmaano: i wouldnt start playing with 1000's of folders without proper software
03:35	<stefg>	tom1502: hard to track... but in menu.lst are certain 'keywors' which control the update-grub procedure... read it carefully, it's well commented
03:35	<Desmaano>	if someone knows how to recover all my files
03:35	<mr_daniel>	ochosi: and than search again for the package with 'sudo apt-cache search xorg'
03:35	<velko>	^^kalm, people usualy don't understand jokes after they lost 40 GB personal data
03:35	<psycop>	magnetron >	i only have 50fps in wine, normally have 150+
03:35	<psycop>	thought id try cedega
03:35	<psycop>	see if it runs better
03:36	<Desmaano>	kalm, it weren't thousands, but now they're recovered it is :(
03:36	<moDumass>	hmm, now how do i start sunbird?

03:36	<LjL>	Desmaano, find some "undelete" type software for Windows, and run it. if you find one that can run from a CD, that's best, since if you log into your system, you'll increase the chances of your files getting overwritten. "undelete" on Google will probably help. still, keep in mind this is an Ubuntu support channel, not a Windows one.

03:38	<LjL>	Desmaano: if you want an Ubuntu solution, there is "testdisk", but i think that won't be nearly as effective as a Windows (FAT/NTFS) specific undelete program, since testdisk is mostly geared towards trying to recover data from ext3 or other similarly "hard to undelete" filesystems.
03:38	<haru>	does anyone know why i cannot get soundoutput in viewing flv files on firefox using flash plugin?
03:38	<ochosi>	mr_daniel: ok, i checked it and the package xorg-drivers-display-ati is already installed

03:41	<assasukasse>	LjL: yes i mean faster in booting
03:41	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: asking the right question is not always easy though, i'll try, be right back
03:41	<fjr>	arko: you should be able to do that
03:41	<Arko>	hmmm
03:41	<CokeNCode>	guys ... where can i find some info. on the use of the 'put' command ?
03:41	<LjL>	assasukasse: oh, ok. remember you can also judge more objectively (and find out which things specifically are slow at boot) if you install the "bootchart" packages
03:41	<fjr>	(not that I have)
03:41	<Arko>	fjr: with openoffice?
03:41	<Arko>	lets try
03:42	<MoxJet>	antidrugue thanks, i'm googling around too
03:42	<CokeNCode>	I mean, the put command, with regards to the http protocol
03:42	<CokeNCode>	it's darn near impossible to find anything online
03:42	<velko>	CokeNCode, are you talking about ftp?
03:42	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: what you are looking  for is "setterm" i think
03:42	<antidrugue>	"man setterm"
03:42	<CokeNCode>	velko, no, http protocol
03:43	<Arko>	fjr: it does not work
03:43	<velko>	CokeNCode, ok. don't know
03:43	<CokeNCode>	crap
03:43	<benj_->	Hi guys, i've just installed Kubuntu, during installation it didn't ask me for a root password.. how can I set it or obtain it?
03:43	<user01>	why are there like 3 different sound servers listed?  esd openoss and alsa . . . how do i kow which one is the problem?
03:43	<fjr>	then again...maybe not
03:43	<SloggerKhan>	by default no root account.
03:43	<CokeNCode>	benj_-, http://www.ubuntux.org/how-to-change-the-root-password-in-ubuntu
03:43	<MoxJet>	antidrugue  maybe this line in rc.M? /bin/setterm -blank 15 -powersave powerdown -powerdown 60
03:43	<benj_->	SloggerKhan: How can I set one up or whatever?
03:43	<thirdalbum>	benj_-, you don't need a root password; use the sudo or kdesu commands install
03:43	<CokeNCode>	benj_-, go to the link i just supplied
03:43	<benj_->	ok
03:43	<IowaDave>	benj: use sudu for things root needs todo
03:44	<BlueStorm_>	soon 1337
03:44	<SloggerKhan>	if you run a dpkg reconfigure-all eventually it will ask, I think.
03:44	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: whatever option you like, and then just put it in /etc/rc.local
03:44	<MoxJet>	reading man page for setterm
03:44	<SloggerKhan>	But that's roundabout
03:44	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: ok, i guess this is it, but i haven't tried it myself, so...
03:45	<Kazol>	Do desklets really take up a lot of CPU time? I have a 500Mhz processor.
03:45	<benj_->	Thanks  CokeNCode, absolute Legend :0
03:45	<benj_->	cheers dudes
03:45	<MoxJet>	yeah it seems i shall have -blank 0 on /bin/setterm
=== benj_- is now known as hybrid_
=== hybrid_ is now known as hybridiZed
03:45	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: probably just "setterm -powersave off"
03:46	<CokeNCode>	np
03:46	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: and it will disable all powersave feature
03:46	<Kazol>	can I move a hd to another computer-will Ubuntu still work?
03:46	<IowaDave>	CokeNCode: what was that link that got benj so happy? :)
03:46	<MoxJet>	#setterm -powersave off
03:46	<MoxJet>	cannot (un)set powersave mode
03:46	<hybridiZed>	CokeNCode: Say I want to play XviD movies etc, where can I find a good codec for Kubuntu etc
03:46	<hybridiZed>	IowaDave: http://www.ubuntux.org/how-to-change-the-root-password-in-ubuntu
03:46	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: or perhaps you need to specify everything, i dont know "setterm -blank 0 -powerdown 0 -powersave off"
03:47	<orbin>	Kazol: as in gdesklets?
03:47	<hybridiZed>	IowaDave: Simple + Easy :)
03:47	<Kazol>	orbin: yes
03:47	<CokeNCode>	IowaDave, basically a link telling you how to set the root password in ubuntu
03:47	<MoxJet>	antidrugue i'm trying with -blank 0, and i'll see if it is still up in half an hour
03:47	<koyo001>	hello
03:47	<MoxJet>	antidrugue thanks for your help =)
03:47	<Desmaano>	does someone has experience unerasing files ??
03:47	<antidrugue>	but "setterm -powersave off" should be enough i guess"
03:47	<koyo001>	i am having a problem with add remove
03:47	<antidrugue>	Moxjet: no problem
03:47	<orbin>	Kazol: i would think it would depend on which one.  some are eye candy intensive.
03:47	<orbin>	Kazol: personally i just use gkrellm
03:48	<koyo001>	does anyone know how to reset it from the console???
03:48	<IowaDave>	Coke: I see that. Thanks!
03:48	<antidrugue>	koyo001: what do you reset it?
03:48	<Kazol>	orbin: what does gkrellm display, and are these desklets compatible for 500Mhz?
03:48	<os2mac>	I saw a mention of that program. what does it do?
03:48	<maan84>	excuse me, how do i delete an entire folder at the terminal?
03:48	<magnetron>	koyo001: what is the problem?
03:48	<BlackAnthrax>	has anyone encountered any problems with feisty and internet/router? it keeps telling me i have been disconnected about every 6 minutes, and it has to find another address. maybe it is my router, im not sure, maybe my modem. but it is odd, cause it started happening with feisty.
03:48	<IowaDave>	sudo has always filled the bill, though.
03:48	<^^kalm>	wow... the bot is funny
03:48	<^^kalm>	!anything
03:48	<ubotu>	So, you wanted to lure me into saying I don't know anything about anything? Yeah, that would be funny, of course. Now leave me alone.

03:48	<lupine_85>	maan84: rm -r
03:49	<maan84>	thx
03:49	<magnetron>	maan84: rm -r foldername will erase folder AND files

03:49	<koyo001>	magnetron: it keeps saying another aplication is using it
03:49	<CokeNCode>	i think that's what i used
03:49	<magnetron>	koyo001: you can't use synaptic and add/remove at the same time
03:49	<Kazol>	what are the minimum CPU specs for gdesklets?
03:49	<CokeNCode>	hmmm, i
03:49	<koyo001>	yeah i k

03:50	<fjr>	i am having a wierd booting problem with my sisters computer
03:50	<^^kalm>	Kazol: you need a pretty old computer for gdesklets not to work
03:50	<koyo001>	magnetron: i know but i am not running any
03:50	<antidrugue>	koyo001: you are sure synaptic, update-manager, and all other package management applications are closed?
03:50	<BlackAnthrax>	os2mac: not yet, but i was going to soon but it also does the same thing for our xboxes we have hooked up, i disocnnected them, but i will try to bypass it when i have time. however, i looked at the modem for a long time, and the sync light never went off, and i think that is good.
03:50	<OatTop>	how do I configure which appear in the top right corner of my windows? (minimize, maximize, close)

03:51	<sascha_>	Hello! Im a new ubuntu-user. Can anyone tell me how i can find out the configuration of the kernel?
03:51	<Kazol>	^^kalm: Do you think it will work? and if I transfer the hd to a another computer will Ubuntu work?
03:51	<sascha_>	especially what it uses to suspend-to-disk in 7.04
03:51	<antidrugue>	koyo001: so "sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock" should do it
03:51	<magnetron>	koyo001: does restarting computer work?
03:51	<koyo001>	magnetron: need to reset it from konsole

03:52	<ForzaPalermo>	so that i can use it to upgrade
03:52	<velko>	ForzaPalermo, yes. this will include the cdrom into the file /etc/apt/sources.list as a source
03:52	<ForzaPalermo>	without deleting everything

04:02	<koyo001>	every update program tells me that i ha
04:02	<LjL>	Drk_Guy: the instructions are probably for Edgy, but it shouldn't be any different, except in Feisty there is also sun-java6-jre (java 6 instead of java 5, that is). basically, enable Multiverse, and then install that package.
04:02	<Drk_Guy>	Magnetron, Synaptic is too hard to manage
04:02	<koyo001>	have another aplication opened
04:02	<Drk_Guy>	I already have the .rpm
04:02	<LjL>	robdeman: trying installing it
04:02	<magnetron>	Drk_Guy: use the "add/remove programs" and search for java
04:02	<Drk_Guy>	how i can install the file

04:03	<robdeman>	LjL: You ar etrying it now?
04:04	<Bakefy>	fjr, its a really old nvidea
04:04	<antidrugue>	Drk_Guy: for developpement? or just for your browser?
04:04	<fjr>	uh oh
04:04	<fjr>	it should pretty much work
04:04	<Bakefy>	fjr, maybe like 32 MB ram
04:04	<LjL>	Drk_Guy, if what you want is just to have the Java machine running for firefox etc, it couldn't be simpler. enable Multiverse (from Software Sources) and then install "sun-java6-jre" from Synaptic or from the command line
04:04	<makuseru>	magnetron: i didnt wanna be mean to is and shut it down like that <<
04:04	<fjr>	the newest drivers dont apply for geforce 4's or less
04:04	<antidrugue>	Drk_Guy: like LjL says it
04:05	<LjL>	robdeman: i'm installing it. right now i've got a dialog starting with "otrs2 must have a database installed and configured before it can be used.  If you like, this can be handled with dbconfig-common."
04:05	<antidrugue>	Drk_Guy: "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin"
04:05	<Bakefy>	fjr, DAMN!
04:05	<fjr>	well for opengl
04:05	<Bakefy>	I should have stayed with edgy
04:05	<robdeman>	LjL: Im not getting that dialog?
04:05	<fjr>	but your standard desktop should be fine

04:21	<equinox_2001>	which nvidia drivers should I use for a geforce 7900
04:21	<bernarderase>	xt: thanks anyway, I'll poke around for a solution
04:21	<nunofgs>	help! I seem to be able to do every desktop effect EXCEPT the expose one... when I move the mouse to the top-right corner nothing happens except for every window's titlebar seems to become corrupted (like something tried to draw on top of it)
04:21	<xtknight>	bernarderase, cool, i'd like to know alslo
04:21	<xtknight>	also*
04:21	<slackern>	equinox_2001, using nvidia-glx-new on a 6800 here and it works fine
04:21	<xtknight>	actually i have a second monitor here i'll play around with it
04:21	<robdeman>	LjL: I did everything you suugested -- auto remove, reinstall, reconfigure priority low.. etc.. still the same problem
04:21	<IowaDave>	surviver: what's wrong? something about a network printer?

04:22	<chrispche>	Can anyone tell me how tp change the res in KDE?
04:22	<shockwave1>	I am curious if fiesty is what people had hoped for, and really worth upgrading to. i only got to use it a little, but it didn't seem to different from edgy

04:22	<xtknight>	i couldnt really think of what could be better, honesly
04:22	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: not at all to me, ive had only problems with feisty
04:23	<shockwave1>	magnetron: what do you like about it
04:23	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, such as?
04:23	<antidrugue>	yes, i love feisty too, really stable too
04:23	<xtknight>	also i wouldn't judge experiences if you used dist-upgade
04:23	<xtknight>	that is inherently problematic
04:23	<magicbytes>	hello, I am new to ubuntu, and linux I just downloaded and installed ubuntu, I have a radeon x1600 graphics card and I would like to set up dual monitors, how can I accomplish this task please ?
04:23	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: hard drive partition mount problems, nvidia drivers not working anymore, wireless usb adaptor not working
04:23	<W7DAH_>	nick W7DAH
04:23	<magnetron>	shockwave1: it does more of the work by itself, and it is more stable + it has nice looks
04:23	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, clean install or upgrade?
04:24	<Blubloblu>	xtknight:upgrade
04:24	<joseaa__>	what is the terminal command to list all running process ?
04:24	<shockwave1>	I did notice that more things seemed to work out of the box. wireless for example
=== W7DAH_ is now known as W7DAH
04:24	<LjL>	joseaa__: ps aux
04:24	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, that could be your problem.  feisty uses different facilities than edgy in some cases.  for example, libata is now used for IDE.  and i dont think in the upgrade the fstab is updated..
04:24	<shockwave1>	what happened with cnr? are they still planning to add it?
04:24	<xtknight>	does an upgrade purge or just simply remove old packages?  what happens to your fstab for example?
04:24	<mhykgyver>	dxdemetriou, ur the man...it worked perfectly..thank you soo much
04:24	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: the hard drive problem is fixed, but now my drivers and xorg.conf are messed up
04:25	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, have you tried the restricted driver manager?
04:25	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, youre on feisty now, right?
04:25	<joseaa__>	LjL, thanks
04:25	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: yeah, that one doesnt work for me
04:25	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, okay what kernel?
04:25	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: no im using a Windoze box
04:25	<xtknight>	ahh
04:25	<IowaDave>	magicbytes: it's a configuration issue in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  type man xorg.conf, look in the device and screen sections
04:25	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: i dont know
04:25	<albert>	hi, is there a gui-based, lightweighted e-mail client available in the repositorie. (lightweighted is most prefered)
04:25	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, if you'd like i'll help you get that stuff setup
04:25	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: yes please
04:25	<joonr>	hi all. I need to change my current gcc compiler which is for the i486 architecture to one for the i386 architecture. How do I do this?
04:25	<intangibleLiquid>	hmm, Mplayer manages to get the full speed is not smooth and it does not match the subtitles
04:26	<xtknight>	Blubloblu, just boot the affected PC in vesa mode so you can get on xchat on there
04:26	<Pimp1984>	I've just tried installing Feisty after downloading the iso from the Oxford mirror. It's failed because there's a load of corrupt files on the CD. Why the heck has that happened?
04:26	<thcmonkey>	just before i upgrade i wanna know if feisty supports wide screen resolutions without changing xorg.conf?
04:26	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: ok, wait a minute
04:26	<velko>	albert, i use sylpheed and i like it
04:26	<babo>	dd -if=/dev/sda2 -of=presumae.txt | grep -i 'CREATE DATABASE .*constellation' ... guys, is that bash command 'safe' ?
04:26	<nunofgs>	hey guys, I wanna hook up ubuntu to my TV... is there an easy to use utility for this? (as opposed to manually editing xorg.conf) ?
04:26	<IowaDave>	pimp1984: check md5 on the download
04:26	<babo>	safe to run that is. It's not going to 'convert' anything ....
04:26	<xtknight>	bernarderase, check advanced options in VLC preferences
04:26	<albert>	velko: i was just told, it's not that lightweighted. (even though it would be an upgrade after thunderbird)
04:26	<Pimp1984>	How do I do that?
04:26	<xtknight>	bernarderase, on the X11 output it has an option called "X Display"

04:27	<magnetron>	albert: open "add/remove programs" and browse the internet category, i think you will find something there
04:27	<albert>	i'm running text-based fluxbox 0rc3, so no add/remove
04:27	<velko>	albert, can't compare it to thunderbird. it's lighter that evolution though

04:27	<magicbytes>	IowaDave, but I am new to linux and I dont have a clue what to do with this config file

04:29	<delire>	joonr: /usr/bin/gcc is just a symlink. you can remove it and re-link.
04:29	<Blubloblu>	xtknight: (typing on win computer) it's a laptop but it has to be plugged into the router because the wifi isnt working, so i have to run upstairs. Its booting now

04:45	<xtknight>	blubloblu, type "sudo modprobe nvidia".  let me know any warnings there.  and then type "dmesg".  check the end to see messages about nvidia.  see if there is anything you wouldn't expect.
04:45	<xtknight>	bernarderase, hmm odd.  i'm afraid i dont konw
04:45	<delire>	magnetron: do you know why the alternate CD works for ATI X* cards whereas the normal ISO doesn't?

04:46	<bernarderase>	xtknight: ok, will keep playing with it and see what I get. Thanks for your help
04:46	<xtknight>	it's just that you can get an installed system with alternate.  you still have to alter X11 conf.  you cant even boot the normla iso with broken video but the alternate uses VESA all the time in installer mode.  still once the alternate installs the system you must modify the system config to use the proper driver ("vesa")
04:46	<woland_>	hey guys how can i get rid of uneeded dependencies?

04:58	<velko>	lobosque, cool
04:58	<blubloblu>	xtknight: and for future reference, once i change xorg to vesa, is there a way to restart X without rebooting?

04:59	<AdministratorX>	If you know the displays refresh rate, you can edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
04:59	<velko>	lobosque, replace YOURFILE with the actual name
04:59	<lobosque>	velko ok
04:59	<|ringo|>	Z__: in the printer driver selection box you can select CUPS, thats the generic printer driver for linux
04:59	<araiss>	hello everyone

05:00	<magnetron>	cotton: i don't know, check out the link in the pm
05:00	<padee>	i am having troubles with eth0... any eth0-experts? ;)
05:00	<Z__>	|ringo|: yep got it, gonna test it out
05:00	<antidrugue>	eth0 experts?
05:00	<lobosque>	velko create a link?
05:00	<bobo>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/ not http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
05:01	<spork>	What's the name of the new program that handles installing various media codecs.  I've upgraded from edgy and I don't think it installed by default, or at least I can't find it in the menus
05:01	<velko>	lobosque, sudo ln -sf /etc/init.d/file /etc/rc2.d/S99netup
05:01	<padee>	antidrugue: experts
05:01	<AdministratorX>	avahi
05:01	<LjL>	robdeman: meanwhile anyway, perhaps --purge uninstall it and try to see if the older version available, otrs (1.3.something) works any better?
05:01	<micker>	hey guys, trying to upgrade edgy to feisty, the upgrade errored out partway through, and I corrcted the problem that caused the error, now when i try laun`h 'update-manger -c -d' I am getting this error "warning: could not initiate dbus" and an error in DistUpgradeFetcher.py of "NameError: global name 'os' is not defined"  Any ideas on whats going on?  I found two threads on the forums of people having the same problem, but no solutions.
05:01	<Krige^>	I have a problem trying to save my firewall rules to a file: when I do "iptables-save >	/etc/iptables.up.rules" I get the error "bash: /etc/iptables.up.rules: Permission denied"
05:01	<blubloblu>	spork: I think its in add/remove programs
05:01	<AdministratorX>	!avahi
05:01	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about avahi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
05:01	<Z__>	|ringo|: cups expert, or cups simple
05:01	<lobosque>	velko and thats all?
05:01	<antidrugue>	padee: what are you trying to do? eth0 does say much...
05:01	<xtknight>	blubloblu, you know what..actually do this.  "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak"  (make a backup of your current xorg.  we will delete it)
05:01	<velko>	lobosque, yes
05:01	<lobosque>	velko thanks ^^
05:02	<sldkfj>	bob, what's the difference?
05:02	<antidrugue>	except that it is the first ethernet device on your machine
05:02	<lobosque>	velko, another question, where i can edit shortcuts? i want to show the desktop with super+d
05:02	<velko>	lobosque, reboot and test it
05:02	<blubloblu>	xtknight: its rediculous the amount of xorg backups i have at this stage! :)
05:02	<sldkfj>	bobo, what's the difference?
05:02	<magnetron>	spork: doubleclick an urecognized media file and it will show up. or install ubuntu-restricted-extras
05:02	<velko>	lobosque, alt+control+d
05:02	<padee>	antidrugue: i installed ubuntu 3 times and even changed the network card... but in network-admin only the ppp0 interface is shown... eth0 is gone...
05:02	<robdeman>	LjL: I tried that sudo apt-get install otrs -->	same problem also no config menu...
05:02	<lobosque>	velko anyway, where i can edit them?
05:02	<jbernhardt>	!dvd
05:02	<ubotu>	For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs
05:02	<lobosque>	velko i can't reboot now, i'm in the middle of a download
05:02	<xtknight>	blubloblu, type "sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf /var/lib/x11/xorg.conf.md5sum"  (case sensitive.  x11 is lower case in the second cmd)
05:03	<antidrugue>	padee : what is your ethernet card? "lspci | grep -i ethernet"
05:03	<smo>	acidrip good for dvd rip
05:03	<bobo>	sldkfj one works on doesnt
05:03	<AdministratorX>	padee: did you edit /etc/network/interfaces
05:03	<smo>	mplayer to readi t with libdvdcss2
05:03	<velko>	lobosque, desktop ->	preferences ->	keyboard shortcuts
05:03	<cotton>	Does anyone here want to take over my desktop to help me install mysql and php?
05:03	<LjL>	robdeman: maybe upgrade to feisty then
05:03	<blubloblu>	xtknight: ok
05:03	<xtknight>	blubloblu, now "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" (sound familiar?)
05:03	<bobo>	sldkfj cant have the www in front
05:03	<lobosque>	velko i cant add new shortcuts there
05:03	<robdeman>	LjL: no thanks... haha
05:03	<xtknight>	blubloblu, and after THAT, pastebin xorg.conf so i can look at it.  it should be more or less a skeleton
05:03	<antidrugue>	AdministratorX: Feisty use network-manager by default, which does use /etc/network/interfaces at all
05:03	<robdeman>	LjL: I am afraid of upgrading my carefully configured 6.10 server
05:04	<velko>	lobosque, you can define new shortcuts using the gconf-editor
05:04	<antidrugue>	doesn't i mean
05:04	<sldkfj>	, I have them both in my firefox right now :P  maybe I'm privileged :p
05:04	<Krige^>	I have a problem trying to save my firewall rules to a file: when I do "iptables-save >	/etc/iptables.up.rules" I get the error "bash: /etc/iptables.up.rules: Permission denied"
05:04	<robdeman>	LjL: Its too new for a production server to my taste..
05:04	<smo>	robdeman so don t do that
05:04	<tph>	I try to do a fresh install of feisty, but the install-cd won't start x and I can't continue the install. It complains that it can't find my screen or something similar. I'm trying to do it on a laptop with mobility raedon x1600. Anyone know a solution?
05:04	<smo>	wait 1 month again
05:04	<LjL>	robdeman: well, you have a point, though if you wanted something to keep long term, you might as well used dapper ;)
05:04	<padee>	administratorX: i didnt edit anything
05:04	<blubloblu>	xtknight: its empty
05:04	<bg111>	!info amsn
05:04	<lobosque>	velko thanks
05:04	<bobesponja>	hey all
05:04	<antidrugue>	padee: so what is your ethernet card model?
05:04	<T0lkman>	hmm ol i'll try, but it's very weird why i cannot choose what i want to install during installation process, like in any other distribs..
05:04	<ubotu>	amsn: An MSN messenger written in tcl. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.96+dfsg1-0ubuntu2 (feisty), package size 2488 kB, installed size 9108 kB

05:04	<aleksanteri>	!amsn | bg11
05:04	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about amsn - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
05:04	<padee>	antidruge: lspci doesnt work...
05:04	<aleksanteri>	oh :P
05:04	<LjL>	robdeman: anyway, now i'm away for a couple of minutes, but i'll try diffing the edgy package with the feisty one and see if i can pick up the difference that makes the config not show...
05:04	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	can anyone help me... somehow I managed to get my network card driver recompiled and working but it doesn't show up on the network monitor
05:05	<antidrugue>	lspci doens't work??
05:05	<xtknight>	blubloblu, then pastebin the xorg.conf that comes out of nvidia-xconfig
05:05	<bobesponja>	I just upgraded to feisty and middle clicking with the mouse wheel to open new tabs and pasting text doesn't work anymore
05:05	<blubloblu>	xtknight: command not found
05:05	<antidrugue>	padee: what about /sbin/lspci ?
05:05	<xtknight>	bah
05:05	<delire>	padee: sudo lspci
05:05	<bobesponja>	how can I get my middle click back?
05:05	<xtknight>	blubloblu, ok i'll just paste an xorg you can try
05:05	<delire>	though isn't lspci user executable?
05:05	<Z__>	|ringo|: now it does something better but still wierd
05:05	<ravenoust>	Hey, does anyone here know of a good(free) antivirus for ubuntu?
05:05	<antidrugue>	yes, lspci is user executable
05:06	<AdministratorX>	padee: there should only be to interfaces atcive in that file "auto lo" and "iface lo inet loopback" everything else should be hashed out.
05:06	<BlueStorm_>	is there a Ubuntu alternative?
05:06	<pianoboy3333>	Where can I get feisty torrents?
05:06	<antidrugue>	ravenoust: antivirus is completely useless in Ubuntu
05:06	<Z__>	|ringo|: prints everything right besides yellow and green come out in yellow
05:06	<velko>	lobosque, the option for showing the desktop is indeed in the "Keyboard shortcuts". its named "Hide all windows and focus desktop"
05:06	<ravenoust>	ok
05:06	<ravenoust>	i didnt know that...why is it so?
05:06	<|ringo|>	Z__: what is your printer model
05:06	<velko>	lobosque, you can just redefine the key combination for it

05:07	<blubloblu>	xtknight: 1600x1200
05:07	<delire>	ravenoust: there are only a couple of viruses actually dangerous for Linux out there and they practically need to be manually installed and executed.
05:07	<AdministratorX>	if not network-manager will have problems
05:07	<chilli>	join #tge
05:07	<antidrugue>	padee: are you sure it works? does it work in other OS ?

05:08	<ubotu>	To change the Gnome splash screen, use !gnome-splashscreen-manager or change the GConf key /apps/gnome-session/options/splash_image using !gconf-editor.
05:08	<delire>	sorcerer: sudo rm -fr *[Qq] uake*

05:09	<xtknight>	!alternate | BlueStorm_
05:09	<ubotu>	BlueStorm_: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
05:09	<tbuss>	I'm having a problem with a external drive. I had it successfully  mount before a I reinstalled ubuntu, now, when I use the same steps; eject disk/turn off (install pmount) (install ntfs-3g) plug disk back in/turn on. The drive does not mount?

05:13	<antidrugue>	padee: no problem, sorry for the lack of answer
05:13	<delire>	sorcerer: there is a disk-useage utility i think in Feisty. otherwise you can use 'du -cxh --max-depth=2 .'
05:13	<antidrugue>	come back some time
05:13	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: could just be a temporary glitch, have you tried again? anyway, use pastebin.ca if it keeps doing that

05:13	<velko>	no_comment, it have to be in you path

05:14	<delire>	sorcerer: du == "disk useage" the 'h' in the argument stands for "human readable" (converting bytes to kb's, megs and gigs).
05:14	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: ?! that *is* our pastebin
05:14	<blubloblu>	xtknight: no, x server crashed
05:14	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: it's the one i've been talking about all along.
05:14	<Vuen>	hey guys, is medibuntu safe to use?
05:14	<Maximilian1st>	oh, I tried pastebin.com first...
05:14	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: try reading the channel topic :P
05:14	<sorcerer>	delire: ic thanks mate
05:14	<xtknight>	blubloblu, blah!  can you get the xorg log somehow?
05:14	<delire>	sorcerer: --max-depth=2 means it will look two directories deep. the dot at the end means  "here" in UNIX.
05:14	<Maximilian1st>	LjL, Sorry for that.
05:14	<sldkfj>	stig,  funny things is....  I've D/Led the alternative twice and the Live once and they all install good but they all reply with the 'Incorrect Login'

05:16	<zunbeltz>	Someone knows how to debug gnome-session
05:16	<xtknight>	blubloblu, well yes but i tihnk that would be the 'vesa' startup since that's what you're on now.  somehow you need to try using nvidia then right after it fails before switching to vesa. "cp /var/log/Xorg.0.log ~/xorgbackup"
05:16	<KevinOoO>	what is the tray package for xchat??
05:16	<cotton>	Can someone please help install php??!!
05:16	<Maximilian1st>	LjL, This happened to me before and I found some info on the ubuntu forums that helped get rid of the problem. Yet I am amazed that it does not install at all and is so hard to remove. Am I the only one trying to install the player?
05:16	<sorcerer>	delire:  what does  -cxh mean and  ma- max-depth= 2 meean in the command  -----du -cxh --max-depth=2

However I don't know how to save and exit the text editor that Terminal is functioning like right now
05:17	<sldkfj>	KevinOoO, it puts an icon in the notifiaction area and flashes when you neick is mentioned
05:17	<atlantis>	antFlo, kiba-dock
05:17	<sky_shark>	could some one help with thisplease
05:17	<FrankX>	hello, i'm having a nightmare upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10... mainly with courier-authdaemon "Package is in a very bad inconsistant state"... any ideas? I've tried Sudo apt-get -f install (as it suggests) but it just doesnt work
05:17	<sldkfj>	nick
05:17	<antFlo>	thanks, atlantis
05:17	<Krige^>	velko: you mean to write that to another directory?
05:17	<KevinOoO>	sldkfj, whats the package name?
05:17	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: it installed ok for me. the problem seems to be network related, like the subnet that vmplayer tries to use is busy or something. give me 1) the output of "cat /etc/network/interfaces"  and 2) try "sudo invoke-rc.d vmware-player stop" followed by the dpkg -r again
05:17	<|ringo|>	sky_shark: what text editor are you using
05:17	<delire>	sorcerer: this summarises what each of those options mean. basically 'c' means total, or summarise. x means, don't look on two filesystems at the same time.
05:17	<atomiku>	What application do you recommend to me that can stream audio to shoutcast servers?
05:17	<atlantis>	anyone know if there is a Thunderbird 2.0 DEB out anywhere?
05:18	<sldkfj>	KevinOoO, not sure, it has 'xchat' in it though
05:18	<tarelerul1>	could It been It does not have the permesion to search all my dirtorys

05:19	<delire>	sorcerer: yes you can do most things in the terminal already. the terminal is just faster.

05:19	<varney>	Hello

05:20	<cotton>	Package php4 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
05:20	<cotton>	This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
05:20	<cotton>	is only available from another source
05:20	<Z__>	AlexC_: yes then
05:20	<sorcerer>	Z__: between edgy and feisty
05:20	<zunbeltz>	exit
05:20	<xtknight>	dooooomi, i have no idea
05:20	<varney>	Hey anyone know how to get tv streams using linux mepis?
05:20	<sldkfj>	BlueStorm_, I have 3 of 7.04  :p
05:20	<LjL>	robdeman: uhm, the feisty package's postinst and postrm is very different from the edgy one
05:20	<sldkfj>	:)
05:21	<xtknight>	alpr, those are compiz themes that can be converted to work with beryl.
05:21	<velko>	FrankX, you may try to remove this package, which gives you headaches. and then reinstall it if you really need it
05:21	<Bartcelon2>	how do I make roaming work to find wireless network ?
05:21	<robdeman>	LjL: erhm not sure what that means?
05:21	<xtknight>	alpr, you need beryl to get emerald theme manager
05:21	<LjL>	varney, this is an Ubuntu support channel. Mepis is not Ubuntu.
05:21	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	is the gnome network manager supposed to blink with activity like the network monitor does
05:21	<xtknight>	alpr, emerald theme manager will not theme gnome/metacity it will only theme if you have beryl
05:21	<delire>	sorcerer: i use OS X fairly often but find it pretty lacking in that what come "out-of-the-box" is pretty fragile and uncustomiseable.
05:21	<LjL>	robdeman: it means the configuration stuff is totally different in the Feisty package
05:21	<sldkfj>	my cd player is wacked, Lite-On sucks
05:21	<Krige^>	velko: drwxr-xr-x 109 root root

05:21	<lemnisca>	hi, i have just upgraded to fiesty from edgy and now can't get X to run, i am getting an error saying 'Failed to load module "nvidia" (module does not exist, 0)', any ideas?
05:21	<LjL>	robdeman: there's not just one difference or two that may account for your problem... they're just 100% different
05:21	<robdeman>	LjL: well but I wasnt installing the Feisty one right
05:21	<alpr>	xtknight,  do you know how i can use those emerald themes with compiz?
05:21	<osirisx11>	to show what is currently playing
05:22	<AaronMT>	So which is the best IDE for C/C++ under Ubuntu?
05:22	<velko>	Krige^, this is a directory, not a file. you cannot cat to a directory
05:22	<AlexC_>	cotton: you on Edgy?
05:22	<magnetron>	!firewall >	f0rtune
05:22	<sorcerer>	delire: true .. but i wish ubunti will be more .. easier and less command and stuff straight out of the box .. and it will kick windows vista for a sixer
05:22	<BlueStorm_>	 mm great 1 hour
05:22	<Maximilian1st>	It does not change much, the problem could be related to the fact that the ethernet wired card is not up because I use a notebook.
05:22	<BlueStorm_>	->	homeworks
05:22	<danielmedina>	\q
05:22	<|ringo|>	AaronMT: xemacs or Scite
05:22	<xtknight>	alpr, well i think you can rename them to .compiz or something like it.  i forgot the compiz theme filename extension
05:22	<cotton>	AlexC_: no, feisty
05:22	<fastnKS>	I really need help, when i play music files i VLC (i use the package from synaptic) i have very low sound and the audio quality is very bad? I have Realtec auido 97 soundcard? do i need to download audio drivers in linux?
05:22	<LjL>	robdeman: no, but i was comparing the Edgy package (which apparently doesn't work) with the Feisty package (which works for me) to find out what may be the culprit
05:22	<AlexC_>	cotton: php4 has been removed from Feisty repos
05:22	<Krige^>	velko: yes, /etc/ is a directory, so?
05:22	<robdeman>	LjL: aaha ok
05:22	<sldkfj>	the auto-eject throws the cd around that it get caught between the tray tabs and the top of the slot and runs the risk of a potential scratch on the surface.
05:22	<AlexC_>	cotton: you should be coding for php5 =)
05:22	<cotton>	AlexC_: What do I add to the respo
05:23	<alpr>	simple renaming would help?
05:23	<cotton>	:)
05:23	<zaeem>	sorcerer: depends on what you want to do
05:23	<blubloblu>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17072/ a lovely 404 lines of log to look at
05:23	<AlexC_>	cotton: you can't, the PHP4 package is no longer avaliable for Feisty,
05:23	<zaeem>	sorcerer: what causes you trouble and makes you use terminal?
05:23	<haru>	does anyone know wheres the beryl plugins directory?
05:23	<velko>	Krige^, you are trying to put the output of a command into a file. but you got permission denied. my question is what permissions does have the file you are trying to output to
05:23	<AlexC_>	cotton: PHP4 is old, php5 is already 2 years old  - you'r best of coding for php5
05:23	<platman>	you should be able to build php4 without a problem
05:23	<dxdemetriou>	the NautilusIconContainer::normal_alpha = 35 from .gtkrc-2.0 doesn't work. anybody knows what change?
05:23	<dooooomi>	hmm... anyway, i want the previous behaviour back. core dumps in the current directory, like it's always been :) but how?
05:23	<AlexC_>	platman: true, but you shouldn't really be coding for php4 =\
05:23	<platman>	just install build-essential and checkintsall and build the package from source yourself
05:23	<Krige^>	velko: the file does not exist yet
05:23	<antFlo>	what the synaptic package name for kiba-dock ? I'm trying to install kiba-dock on Ubuntu Feisty. Please help.

05:23	<dunstabulos_>	logging out and logging back in fixes this but i would like to prevent this happening
05:24	<zaeem>	haru: dunno, but if you want to remove it then "sudo aptitude remove beryl*" and it removes every thing beryl related
05:24	<pardus_>	turk var m

05:24	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: no, won't be any use
05:24	<delire>	sorcerer: Linux is never going to _always_ work "out-of-the-box" when installed by a user in a world with so many different hardware configurations. buying Linux preinstalled is the best option in this case, from someone like: http://system76.com
05:24	<sorcerer>	the OS ..coz she has never heard oflinux lol
05:24	<blubloblu>	xtknight: did you get the pastebin link? I think interesting stuff is at the very end http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17072/

05:24	<alpr>	renaming didnt help xtknight  :(

05:26	<delire>	antFlo: apt-cache search kiba dock
05:26	<haru>	zaeem,  dont we all
05:26	<AlexC_>	antFlo: don't repeat so quickly, but just search for "kiba"
05:26	<haru>	sldkfj, nones there apparantly
05:26	<sorcerer>	zaeem: nice mate
05:26	<LjL>	Maximilian1st: if you type  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade , does it complain about anything?
05:26	<blubloblu>	xtknight: are you still there? Sorry for all this trouble
05:26	<zaeem>	haru: i got ati 9600, what ya got
05:26	<sorcerer>	zaeem:  i always used .. umm command
05:26	<haru>	zaeem, 9250 :(
05:26	<antFlo>	thanks delire
05:27	<Krige^>	velko: I can't write to /etc/ nor to /opt/
05:27	<Krige^>	velko: despite the fact I am using sudo
05:27	<AlexC_>	Krige^: because you do not have permission, only root has permission to those
05:27	<zaeem>	sorcerer: i had the same problem, i thought linux was all command and shit so i always used the command line but in ubuntu almost everything has a graphical alternative
05:27	<fastnKS>	Does somebody know what kernel Ubuntu 7.04 has? cause im going to download audio drivers but dont know the kernel? , can somebody say what kernel it it?
05:27	<AlexC_>	fastnKS: 2.6.20
05:27	<Krige^>	AlexC_:  but I am using sudo
05:27	<sorcerer>	delire: thats cooll the siteyou sent nice .. i just more hardware will support ubuntu the way it supports windows
05:27	<zaeem>	haru: you got beryl working though?
05:27	<sldkfj>	haru, I think those there already are built in and those you want to add would be compiled in the.beryl folder in the user directory
05:27	<haru>	zaeem, yep
05:27	<delire>	zaeem: it's likely that ATI won't properly support Linux until major vendors start preinstalling it.
05:27	<rosaklein>	hi.i have an older version (5.10) on my laptop, how can i upgrade to dapper
05:27	<velko>	Krige^, maybe the filesystem is mounted read only? check if your /etc/fstab have an option like "remount-readonly" for the / file system
05:28	<zaeem>	haru: follow a guide or something
05:28	<AlexC_>	!upgrade | rosaklein
05:28	<ubotu>	rosaklein: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
05:28	<zaeem>	delire: well i hope dell makes em
05:28	<xtknight>	blubloblu, yeah
05:28	<LjL>	velko, Krige^: commands like  sudo cat somefile >	some-root-only-place  will not work, because the redirection is performed by the shell itself, not by sudo. you won't have permissions to write to the ">" file
05:28	<xtknight>	blubloblu, i'm here.  had gone AFK for a second.
05:28	<haru>	zaeem, nope :) it worked out of the box
05:28	<Hattori>	if pureftpd starts automatically on boot, where is the command line that boot it?
05:28	<rosaklein>	than you
05:28	<KevinOoO>	whats the name of the systray package for xchat
05:28	<LjL>	velko, Krige^: what you need in those cases is  sudo sh -c "cat somefile >	blahblah"  , so that the redirection is performed from inside sudo
05:28	<zaeem>	haru: fiesty?
05:28	<frolle>	Hey guys i am having this problem with hellanzb, its a python script: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17073/
05:28	<Enquest>	I keep losing my wifi connection can someone help me with this?
05:28	<Krige^>	LjL: that's a reasonable explanation :)
05:28	<delire>	sorcerer: Linux is becoming increasingly supported by external hardware manufacturers. Linux is the fastest growing desktop OS at the moment apparently, so things can only get better.

=== asdf__ is now known as LuisRuaMorte
05:28	<xtknight>	blubloblu, okay
05:28	<krux0>	kirge^:  sudo -i  that should allow you to write to /etc/ and /opt...but you also might want to check if the filesystems were mounted with rw permissions...so run  mount and look at the mount points of the respective directories to see if that's the problem
05:29	<xtknight>	blubloblu, are YOU still here? lol
05:29	<velko>	LjL, therefore i suggested "sudo cmd >	tmpfile; sudo cp tmpfile /etc/.." but it does not worked
05:29	<blubloblu>	xtknight: im here alright
05:29	<haru>	zaeem, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Feisty_with_XGL
05:29	<sorcerer>	delire: hey man that command du .. will it let me know what files used up all my space on my root ?
05:29	<xtknight>	blubloblu, ok type "sudo modprobe nvidia"
05:29	<haru>	zaeem,  yes fiesty
05:29	<xtknight>	blubloblu, and then type "dmesg".  post the output of dmesg.  it should reveal something
05:29	<Krige^>	krux0: thanks mate :)
05:29	<kbrooks>	1367 ppl here  wow
05:29	<zaeem>	haru: thx will have a look
05:29	<mwe>	is there any gtk mathematical function plotter?
05:29	<xtknight>	!info gnuplot
05:29	<LjL>	velko: that one should normally work, if tmpfile itself is in someplace that the user itself has access to
05:29	<ubotu>	gnuplot: A command-line driven interactive plotting program. In component universe, is optional. Version 4.0.0-5 (feisty), package size 1 kB, installed size 24 kB
05:29	<antFlo>	both synaptic and terminal search are not giving anything for kiba dock, please help
05:29	<sorcerer>	delire: but will it be at a point where dell and stuff will be shipping ubuntu with .. products ?
05:29	<blubloblu>	xtknight: modprobe returns this FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko': No such file or directory
05:29	<xtknight>	blubloblu, hmm
05:30	<xtknight>	blubloblu, what the?  modprobe worked before?
05:30	<delire>	sorcerer: yep, 'sudo du -cxh --max-depth=2 /root/'
05:30	<velko>	LjL, indeed. i don't know where he executed the command though
05:30	<platman>	mwe- you can use octave + gnuplot
05:30	<blubloblu>	xtknight: i know
05:30	<xtknight>	blubloblu, i'm not liking the sounds of this.  hmm
05:30	<antFlo>	i've tried apt-cache search kiba dock as well, no result found.
05:30	<xtknight>	what pkg contains /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko  ???
05:30	<delire>	sorcerer: or just 'sudo du -cxh /root/' for an overall summary
05:30	<Krige^>	I could solve the problem becoming root, but I can't in ubuntu because such a user does not exist, right?
05:30	<xtknight>	dpkg: /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko not found.
05:30	<xtknight>	strange, strange..
05:30	<delire>	sorcerer: oops i mean 'sudo du -cxsh /root/' for an overall summary
05:30	<mwe>	platman: I'll look into it
05:30	<debaser>	sudo passwd
05:30	<sldkfj>	anyone have word that the ubuntu 386 system will run on amd64 architecture ?
05:30	<debaser>	su
05:30	<blubloblu>	xtknight: i looked at a x server log yesterday and it said somethin similar
05:31	<xtknight>	sldkfj, yes amd64 supports i386.
05:31	<znejk>	if i want to run the command ifconfig eth0 down on bootup before the mounting where should i put it?
05:31	<Krige^>	ljl
05:31	<xtknight>	blubloblu, type "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules"
05:31	<velko>	Krige^, it does exist. just it's not enabled by default. check in /etc/passwd
05:31	<Krige^>	LjL: they should change this page accordingly then https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
05:31	<sldkfj>	xtknight, maybe I'll try that to solve my troubles,  I won't like it though
05:31	<Bartcelon2>	what is the best way to get a response here ... or to have a conversation ?
05:31	<zaz>	hi, i have had a problem with my left channel speaker emitting a horrible high pitched sound. i found the solution on the internet, but dont know which file to edit. i have to do this -  set "options snd-hda-intel position_fix=1 model=3stack" to "/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base". please advise
05:31	<delire>	znejk: /etc/network/interfaces would be the best place, though not written as that.
05:31	<sldkfj>	'my tty troubles'
05:31	<debaser>	Krige^: use 'sudo passwd' and then 'su'
05:32	<Enquest>	delire, you talkien to me?
05:32	<delire>	Enquest: nope
05:32	<blubloblu>	xtknight: package not found
05:32	<Enquest>	:(
05:32	<narek>	hey, when i try to boot up ubuntu 7.04 from my dvd-player the screen just goes blank after the loading stages, i can hear the start sound though (sounds like som kind of animal), i use a radeon x1600PR, anyone know whats wrong?
05:32	<Bartcelon2>	is there a guide to this IRC chat and to make it productive ?
05:32	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, The internet wouldn't function after I switched from wireless to cable. After a reboot, the package can be be removed.
05:32	<Krige^>	debaser: it worked :)
05:32	<sorcerer>	delire: this kinda doesnt look right http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17074/
05:32	<xtknight>	blubloblu, sorry i mean "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname-r`"
05:32	<LjL>	Krige^: hm? that page never mentions sudo
05:32	<debaser>	Krige^: great
05:32	<delire>	Bartcelon2: politely ask a question and hope someone knows the answer.
05:33	<LjL>	Maximilian1st_: uh... weird nuff
05:33	<Bartcelon2>	thanks delire
05:33	<xtknight>	where does nvidia.ko come from in Feisty
05:33	<xtknight>	cuz it's not in restricted modules
05:33	<xtknight>	is it built on the fly?
05:33	<Krige^>	debaser, krux0, LjL, velko: I wonder how could a computer novice cope with all this complex stuff, I just wanted to make my file sharing applications to work
05:33	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, It is, I think it is due to the fact that it looks for the wired ethernet and it is not up while using the wireless connection.
05:33	<Bartcelon2>	now is it best to keep re asking the question or is that rude and anoying
05:33	<delire>	sorcerer: that's right.. are you sure your root directory is where all those quake files are? how about try that command but with /home instead of /root?
05:34	<Krige^>	LjL: it mentions a procedure to update and save the iptables
05:34	<antFlo>	i've tried apt-cache search kiba dock as well, no result found.
05:34	<tbuss>	can some plz help with external hdd mount. I have tried sudo apt-get install pmount sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g I have tried sudo pmount-hal /dev/sda1 and nothing works.
05:34	<kbrooks>	Bartcelon2, don't repeat too much every two seconds
05:34	<debaser>	Krige^: I've just entered the channel, I dunno what you're talking about
05:34	<blubloblu>	xtknight: it still looks for linux-restricted modules
05:34	<Maximilian1st_>	LjL, Now I will try re-installing it with the wired ethernet plugged in and see if that solves the problem here.
05:34	<xtknight>	blubloblu, what do you mean?
05:34	<kbrooks>	Bartcelon2, patience is a virtue
05:34	<xtknight>	grrr where on earth is nvidia.ko
05:34	<Bartcelon2>	thanks for guidance ;-)
05:34	<Krige^>	debaser: I have a problem trying to save my firewall rules to a file: when I do "sudo iptables-save >	/etc/iptables.up.rules" I get the error "bash: /etc/iptables.up.rules: Permission denied"
05:34	<Bartcelon2>	first time here
05:34	<delire>	Bartcelon2: play it by ear and repeat every few minutes if you must. you just have to wait and come back later if you get no response..
05:34	<sorcerer>	delire: sorcerer@Matrix:~$ sudo du -cxsh /home 4.3G    /home 4.3G    total sorcerer@Matrix:~$  thats what i got ..
05:35	<blubloblu>	xtknight: isnt it supposed to look for linux-restriceted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic?
05:35	<platman>	antFlo: I think you have to download the RPM package for Kiba dock and convert it to deb using alien.
05:35	<xtknight>	blubloblu, yea
05:35	<delire>	sorcerer: that sounds more like it..
05:35	<xtknight>	blubloblu, did you try reinstalling that pkg?
05:35	<platman>	either that or you can build it yourself pretty easily
05:35	<dooglus>	Krige^: the 'sudo' bit only applies to the stuff up to the '>'
05:35	<debaser>	Krige^: try with sudo before the whole thing
05:35	<sorcerer>	delire: oh i know where the quake files are but i used to have 15 gigs .. on  root what the hell took up all my space ????

05:35	<antFlo>	thanks platman.
05:35	<Krige^>	debaser: LjL pointed out that commands like  sudo cat somefile >	some-root-only-place  will not work, because the redirection is performed by the shell itself, not by sudo. you won't have permissions to write to the ">" file
05:35	<dooglus>	Krige^: use 'sudo -i' to get a root shell, then try it
05:35	<xtknight>	how do i get the path to a module, i.e. "nvidia"?
05:35	<xtknight>	modprobe nvidia works but i do not see nvidia.ko anywhere
05:35	<debaser>	Krige^: try with '... >	...'
05:35	<xtknight>	nevermind i think it's my updatedb
05:35	<tbuss>	is it possible for a external hdd that was in use with linux (formatted with ntfs-3g) to cause problems when mounting to a new system
05:36	<zaz>	what is the the sound config file called?
05:36	<Krige^>	dooglus: what's the -i for?
05:36	<dooglus>	Krige^: interactive
05:36	<delire>	sorcerer: i don't know! 5 gigs for Ubuntu wouldn't be unusual. the rest your own files most likely..
05:36	<velko>	xtknight, the modules are in /lib/modules
05:36	<Aiwuu>	hi i have a problem with the instalation in ubuntu 7.04 :o
05:36	<sorcerer>	delire:  here can you take a look at this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17075/
05:36	<dooglus>	Krige^: it means you get root's environment, not yours
05:36	<blubloblu>	xtknight: sorry for the noob question but how do you reinstall with apt-get
05:36	<dooglus>	Krige^: sudo bash -c "blah >	blah.txt" will work, too
05:36	<Krige^>	debaser, dooglus: I'll try with -i first
05:36	<xtknight>	blubloblu, sudo apt-get --reinstall install PKGNAME
05:36	<xtknight>	velko, ah i found it in ./volatile/
05:36	<dooglus>	Krige^: 'cos that way the '>' happens is a root shell, not yours
05:37	<Krige^>	dooglus: yeah, that's what LjL pointed out earlier
05:37	<Lilacor>	how do i mount a usb hdd whose controller shows up under lsusb/
05:37	<capiira>	hi hi anyone know if there exist a gtk frontend for cryptsetup ?
05:37	<dooglus>	Krige^: "sudo -i" on its own, then "iptables >	whatever" after, without sudo
05:37	<matkix0s>	!beryl
05:37	<krux0>	Krige^: It is not complex. It is rather simple if you ask me. If writing or reading is not allow to a directory. Check your user permissions, if they grant writing permission then the next step  would be to check if the directory was mounted read-only because that is the only case where a filesystem might not let you write to a directory even if you do have the correct permissions
05:37	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
05:37	<Krige^>	dooglus, debaser: I think the -i option it's the best solution
05:37	<dooglus>	Krige^: then "exit" to get out of the root shell
05:37	<xtknight>	can someone explain how nvidia.ko gets placed in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/volatile?  no pkg name is coming up as containing nvidia.ko.
05:37	<delire>	sorcerer: you've got your home directory and all of the ubuntu system directory in the same partition. not hard to believe that would all come to 11Gb
05:37	<AlexC_>	I see,
05:37	<dooglus>	Krige^: probably, yes, but there will be people here that'll tell you you don't need to run root shells...
05:38	<blubloblu>	xtknight: ok, reinstalled
05:38	<xtknight>	dooglus, you can sudo a whole line by using "sudo sh -c "heresthecommand >	iwanttopipe""
05:38	<cotton>	How can I uninstall php,apache and mysql????
05:38	<dooglus>	xtknight: I said that just a minute ago
05:38	<tbuss>	how to you run ntfsfix on an external hdd

05:38	<Krige^>	krux0: what I meant is that someone should have written something to get this thing easier: I guess all of the users want their software to be unblocked by the firewall

05:39	<Lilacor>	cotton: apt-get remove apache, mysql, php
05:39	<dooglus>	xtknight: 'iwanttopipe' is a misleading name though - there are no pipes involved there, only redirection
05:39	<xtknight>	blubloblu, alright now type "ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/volatile" any luck?
05:39	<densin>	can't find  gpm for 7.04server  .
05:39	<Lilacor>	'er... without the commas
05:39	<dewaard>	I read somewhere that 7.04 has *both* Python 2.4.4 and 2.5. My problem is that TurboGears has some issues with 2.5 (or rather, some of the libraries it uses). Is there any way to use 2.4.4 for this or should I just downgrade my OS?
05:39	<tbuss>	is anyone familiar with 'ntfsfix'
05:39	<joshua__>	hello

05:39	<sorcerer>	delire:  how did you know the home directory was there ? /dev/hda1... ?
05:39	<densin>	ubotu: becoz I not success to apti-get update?
05:39	<xtknight>	blubloblu, ok type "sudo modprobe nvidia"
05:40	<xtknight>	blubloblu, then pastebin the contents of "dmesg"
05:40	<delire>	sorcerer: because /home is not listed as a separate partition on any other mount point
05:40	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can know just by looking carefully, when the system starts, it says "Kernel Panic - your error" in a black/white text?
05:40	<Aiwuu>	nope, dont says Kernel Panic
05:40	<adaptr>	Aiwuu: start up in recovery mode or you won't see any messages
05:40	<blubloblu>	xtknight: modprobe says its not loading nvidia_legacy, not used in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
05:40	<xtknight>	blubloblu, oh ridiculous :\
05:40	<Aiwuu>	no :S, i cant start ubuntu...
05:41	<Krige^>	krux0: I mean, if install a file sharing software it should be implicit that I want it to be unblocked from the firewall
05:41	<tbuss>	wow, I just lost all data on my external hdd, that sux..............thanks linux
05:41	<debaser>	Aiwuu: he says that you must select recovery mode in GRUB
05:41	<beterraba>	has somebody already installed a hp lasersjet 1018?
05:41	<xtknight>	blubloblu, well change your video driver to nvidia in xorg.conf then save it.  dont reboot X.  now type "sudo modprobe nvidia" and paste dmesg...
05:41	<aboof>	would there be anywhere I could find a package of samba 3.0.25rc2 for feisty, or should I just compile it
05:41	<Aiwuu>	same... i cant star recovery mode in grub
05:41	<debaser>	Aiwuu: the same error?

05:43	<sorcerer>	delire: yeah man it is .. lol your not from america .. lol ioam not i just to college in america something i picked up :)
05:43	<xtknight>	blubloblu, that's okay, pastebin dmesg
05:43	<dooglus>	Krige^: the default iptables chains 'allow' everything
05:43	<dager>	zaz: asound.conf ?
05:43	<delire>	sorcerer: ok, i've been to America but didn't hear that one..
05:43	<Krige^>	dooglus: in fact aMule and Azureus didn't work until I wrote the proper rules to release their ports
05:43	<BlackAnthrax>	i am having some troubles lately. i used edgy for the longest, and now in feisty, there *seems to be a problem with feisty and my router, the internet works fine, but about every six minutes, it pops up and tells me no address, then i have to wait abou 10 seconds for it to reconnect to the network. i tried hooking up my pc straight to the modem, and right now it is working without deconnecting. and known issues with linksys r
05:43	<sorcerer>	delire: where you from
05:43	<antidrugue>	dager: asound.conf is not needed since dapper...
05:43	<robdeman>	LjL: hey I have otrs2 working... manually editted the httpd conf
05:43	<Aiwuu>	if there is a way to fix that... i want to know, because i dont want to download again the alternate cd because i have a slow conection :/
05:43	<dooglus>	Krige^: Azureus doesn't need any ports open to work - it just works a bit faster if people can connect
05:43	<blubloblu>	xtknight: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17076/
05:44	<Krige^>	dooglus: is this in Ubuntu only?
05:44	<delire>	sorcerer: all over the place ;)
05:44	<dooglus>	Krige^: no
05:44	<dooglus>	Krige^: debian is the same
05:44	<sky_shark>	ringo I am using terminal it  has these ^G Get Help,  ^X Exit...etc command things at the bottom
05:44	<sorcerer>	delire: lol really mate where you from
05:44	<sky_shark>	but I don'know how to use them
05:44	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: I suppose you're using DHCP, do  you have that problem with any other PC?
05:44	<zaz>	dager: there is nothing in sudo gedit asound.conf, any other suggestions
05:44	<sky_shark>	I apologize for not replying ealier I was on another window
05:44	<antidrugue>	dooglus: Azureus can do UDP, but it does need permission to do those UDP request
05:44	<Krige^>	dooglus: well, isn't it obvious that a user want any software to run faster?
05:44	<blubloblu>	sky_shark: you're in nano, a command line text editor
05:45	<debaser>	Aiwuu: please answer me, when does it say "error"?
05:45	<sky_shark>	okay
05:45	<sky_shark>	so how do I save and exit?
05:45	<Aiwuu>	before
05:45	<Aiwuu>	the kernel information
05:45	<blubloblu>	sky_shark: use the control key + the letter to use them
05:45	<sky_shark>	okay
05:45	<sky_shark>	thank you
05:45	<blubloblu>	sky_shark: to save and exit Control+X
05:45	<BlackAnthrax>	um...well, it worked fine, everything, my other computer, and our xboxes hooked up to the router as well, but now in feisty it seems to be messing up addresses and then everything (other computer, xboxes) mess up. they all have to reconnect
05:45	<cotton>	http://apache.pastebin.ca/452848
05:45	<dooglus>	Krige^: when I say 'faster', I don't mean the program runs faster, I mean it downloads faster.  I don't want that - it downloads plenty fast enough already.  I have to slow it down to stop it hogging the whole connection as it is.
05:45	<delire>	sorcerer: i like to avoid talking about myself in IRC..
05:45	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: that was to you
05:45	<sky_shark>	great it worked thanks blubloblu
05:45	<xtknight>	blubloblu, this honesly doesn't make sense
05:45	<debaser>	Aiwuu: so you get some lines of information (with the GRUB commands and then the error)?
05:46	<Aiwuu>	maybe 2, or 3...
05:46	<poningru>	dooglus: what are you trying to do?
05:46	<Aiwuu>	or 1
05:46	<blubloblu>	xtknight: whats happening?
05:46	<xtknight>	blubloblu, nvidia loads fine...then it gets spontaneously deleted?
05:46	<xtknight>	blubloblu, the dmesg looks flawless
05:46	<Aiwuu>	i dont remember... may i look?
05:46	<blubloblu>	xtknight: fun
05:46	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: check the DHCP configuration in your feisty
05:46	<xtknight>	blubloblu, i may suggest a reinstall.  nvidia.ko doesnt just get deletd out of the blue
05:46	<sorcerer>	delire: oh ok i understand iam pretty new to irc as well
05:46	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: how?
05:46	<debaser>	Aiwuu: go ahead
05:46	<dooglus>	poningru: I'm trying to tell Krige^ that ubuntu's default firewall configuration is 'everything allowed' and that he shouldn't need to add any special rules to get filesharing working.
05:46	<sorcerer>	delire: anything i should know of?
05:47	<poningru>	hehe
05:47	<xtknight>	blubloblu, actually you could try "nv" drivers :
05:47	<Aiwuu>	ok
05:47	<Aiwuu>	be right back
05:47	<dooglus>	poningru: in fact I have managed to tell him that a couple of times, but he won't believe me.
05:47	<xtknight>	blubloblu, unless you need 3d..
05:47	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: open a console and execute 'ifconfig'
05:47	<blubloblu>	xtknight: lets give them a go
05:47	<xtknight>	blubloblu, 'nvidia' is pointless
05:47	<xtknight>	blubloblu, just change driver to nv and pray
05:47	<dooglus>	poningru: maybe you could tell him too?  :)
05:47	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: what am i looking for?
05:47	<antidrugue>	delire: deutschland hey?
05:47	<xtknight>	blubloblu, "nv" not "nvidia"
05:47	<poningru>	dooglus, Krige^ thats for outgoing not for incoming
05:47	<blubloblu>	xtknight: ok, here we go
05:47	<foug>	has anyone tried installing WoW in feisty yet? I'm following a guide and it isn't working
05:47	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: the IP address
05:47	<bradyc>	Yeah, eventually I'll go back to the nvidia drivers, but right now I'm stuck at 800x600 because of them... :-(
05:47	<Krige^>	dooglus: but Azureus complained it was blocked by the firewall, I am using a brand new 7.04, didn't touch anything
05:47	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: is that the inet addr?
05:47	<poningru>	dooglus, Krige^ well the firewall there is none, just no programs that do incoming i.e no servers
05:48	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: y
05:48	<poningru>	Krige^: do you have a router?
05:48	<Krige^>	poningru: yeah
=== TM-Gone is now known as tmgomez
05:48	<dooglus>	Krige^: "sudo iptables -L" will show you the firewall rules
05:48	<antidrugue>	krige: your router perhaps
05:48	<Krige^>	poningru: I already verified it redirects the ports to it
05:48	<poningru>	Krige^: well you have to open a port for azureus to accept incoming rules
05:48	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: i have it, what do i do with it?
05:48	<dooglus>	Krige^: you should see a bunch of lines like "Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)" - with 'ACCEPT' being the important word
05:48	<antidrugue>	feisty doesn't have a firewall installed by default
05:48	<Krige^>	poningru: already done that and checked
05:48	<tmgomez>	morning all
05:48	<debaser>	Krige^: then it's surely an iptables problem or local firewall, not router
05:49	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: tall it to me
05:49	<poningru>	Krige^: can you try deluge and see if that works?
05:49	<Krige^>	debaser: yes, I agree
05:49	<foug>	has anyone tried installing WoW in feisty yet? I'm following a guide and it isn't working
05:49	<matkix0s_>	Question, I have an ipod and have installed the "gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg" package, but rhythmbox will still not play the m4a files... what do I still need to to for this to work?

05:49	<Krige^>	poningru: delu-what?!
05:49	<bulmer>	koyo001: whats the problem?
05:49	<poningru>	!deluge | Krige^
05:49	<ubotu>	Krige^: deluge is a new Bittorrent client, created using Python and GTK+, intended to bring a native, full-featured client to !GTK environments such as GNOME and Xfce - See http://deluge-torrent.org/ for more information
05:49	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: isn't that a little odd?
05:49	<blubloblu>	xtknight: YAY!!!!!! it worked, I'm so happy!
05:49	<blubloblu>	xtknight: thank you so much
05:49	<xtknight>	blubloblu, heh good.  nvidia...what a waste ;O
05:49	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: can you check the IP address of other computers in the LAN connected to the router?
05:50	<koyo001>	bulmer: well the apt get tries to get it and install it

Now when I set to roaming it can not find any networks.

05:50	<BlackAnthrax>	debaser: um, right now the router isn't connected, i can go do all of that, but may i ask what it matters?
05:50	<xtknight>	deluge isnt in repositories?
05:50	<bradyc>	I don't think it's a waste to utilize the video card you paid a lot of money for... although spending hours trying to get it to work sucks.
05:50	<Krige^>	poningru: ah, I thought it was a verb :) why should I use deluge in place of Azureus? Is that the advised torrent application in Ubuntu?
05:50	<antidrugue>	koyo001: do you need JRE or JDK? does it not work?
05:50	<stefg>	!wifi | Bartcelon2

05:51	<bulmer>	koyo001: what is the command you have used to install?
05:51	<xtknight>	blubloblu, see ya
05:51	<poningru>	matkix0s: sudo aptitude purge apache2 mysql php

05:51	<tmgomez>	bulmer feisty server
05:51	<xtknight>	is there any way to tell dpkg to automatically grab repos from apt-get if it cant install a pkg.

05:51	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: not really
05:51	<debaser>	BlackAnthrax: its not important now

06:16	<Andr>	can I do a question please
06:16	<debaser>	Andr: just do it
06:16	<rsk>	Andr: sure
06:16	<Z__>	Andr: ask your question, done ask to ask it

06:16	<stefg>	Andeh: you can't mount swap partitions... use swapon /dev/hd[foobar] 
06:16	<lobosque>	rsk so the games are developed in C?
06:16	<Andr>	thank you

06:17	<oldude67>	synjet: its not there...and i used the synaptic to load it
06:17	<vignesh>	hi all
06:17	<debaser>	lobosque: games can be developed in a lot of languages, but C++ is surely the best alternative along with C
06:17	<Andr>	I update ubuntu to Feisty
06:17	<rsk>	lobosque: GCC handles many languages, chek wikipedia it has a good list. so not only c :)
06:17	<alpr>	how can i make my feisty fawn's compiz to accept emerald and/or cgwd themes?
06:17	<vignesh>	can anyone help me setup my mic ?

06:17	<Ranpha1>	My touchpad won't tap i follow the wiki on synaptics but still no tap. It worked with the ubuntu live cd

06:17	<stefg>	Andeh... UUID!
06:17	<h4wk>	Afternoon all
06:17	<retarded-brb>	antidrugue i cannot check the md5 checksum :-/ there is no md5 file . and if i paste the key in fastsum it doesnt do anything ..
06:18	<h4wk>	checking for libpq++.h... configure: error: Unable to find libpq++.h
06:18	<stefg>	!UUID | Andeh
06:18	<debaser>	lobosque: actually GCC means "GNU Compiler Collection", includes C, C++, java, fortran, ada, etc
06:18	<ubotu>	Andeh: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell:  blkid  (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)
06:18	<antidrugue>	retarded: http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/feisty/
06:18	<Andeh>	stefg: Uhm... ok...
06:18	<h4wk>	Ive apt-get all the postgre packages
06:18	<antidrugue>	retarded: md5sum are there
06:18	<cornucopia>	apo, probably a makefile error
06:18	<h4wk>	including the c++ api
06:18	<oldude67>	synjet: im a newbie to linux what command?
06:18	<Andeh>	stefg: Ok this time it shows up as swap but isnt activated. How do i get it to auto activate?

06:18	<lobosque>	debaser but the ubuntu site says that everything is developed in python O.o
06:19	<stefg>	Andeh: write it to /etc/fstab
06:19	<Andr>	I update the system to feisty, but in the Network configuration dont appear WPA, only appear  WEP hex and WEP Ascci
06:19	<retarded-brb>	yes ok . i got the "ubuntu alternate md5 thingy.." but i can not check it
06:19	<synjet>	oldude67: open a terminal and type "apollon" to see if that invokes the program..
06:19	<Andeh>	stefg: What do i write in?
06:19	<vignesh>	anyone ?
06:19	<oldude67>	synjet: ok
06:19	<antidrugue>	retarded: cannot check it ? why?
06:19	<zaggynl>	Where can I find out what the difference between edgy->feisty are?
06:19	<debaser>	lobosque: ?? everything in ubuntu? that's true, but it doesn't mean that everything MUST be programmed in python
06:19	<|Snake|>	hello
06:19	<apo>	cornucopia: I just looked at it... it seems to want /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source/, but I don't have the kernel sources there... Perhaps extracting them there might help :)
06:19	<AlexC_>	vignesh: people wont scroll back up to see your question, just ask it again

06:20	<vignesh>	AlexC_: I want to setup my mic

06:20	<Andr>	HI ?
06:20	<antidrugue>	"md5sum ubuntu....iso"
06:20	<debaser>	lobosque: it means that the ubuntu system is programmed in python: upgrade tools and things like that, but the programas you use can be programmed in a lot of programming languages
06:20	<AlexC_>	|Snake|: gah, we are not psysic ... just ask your question
06:20	<antidrugue>	and compare the output
06:20	<synjet>	vignesh: after setting up the mic, what is the specific error you ran into?
06:20	<arooni>	how can i get the 'dynamic c library' for feisty?
06:20	<debaser>	lobosque: mostly  C and C++
06:20	<retarded-brb>	but im not under ubuntu or linux now ..
06:20	<nielsm>	hmm, feisty randomly fails to detect my onboard ac97 sound on start, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't (nforce pro (4) chipset)
06:20	<debaser>	Andr: what's your problem?
06:20	<retarded-brb>	brb
06:20	<lobosque>	debaser lets say that i want to develop in python and get a single-executable-file, is not possible?
06:20	<ScottSatkin>	Andr: go ahead and ask your question
06:20	<|Snake|>	well i am having a problem with my host server
06:20	<synjet>	oldude67: gift? could you be little more specific?
06:21	<Andeh>	stefg: Is this my swap line? :  UUID=a99c6f67-42b9-43f7-af38-9f3029c43c30 none swap sw 0 0

06:21	<Z__>	can anyone reccomend a kickass beryl theme, i suck at finding good stuff
06:21	<Hobbsee>	Andeh: yes, should be
06:21	<|Snake|>	the host use plesk control panel
06:21	<vignesh>	synjet: I don`t get any error.. I tried recording and did a playback... I don`t get anything
06:21	<|Snake|>	anyone familliar with that
06:21	<dunstabulos_>	Z_: try asking in #ubuntu-effects
06:21	<stefg>	Andeh: yes, given the UUID is correct... compare to the blkid output
06:21	<Andr>	yes, in the network configuration dont appear WPA, it only appear WEB
06:21	<Bartcelon2>	I have selected roaming mode in WIFI settings  but can not enable ( put in the check box ) I am completely lost on how to enable Anhave no read all teh support documentation.  Still obviously I am missing something. I can not use anything else but raoming while manual forces me into using WEP key
06:21	<debaser>	lobosque: you get a single 'python' executable or a single 'python-program.py' executable?
06:21	<Andr>	WEP
06:21	<psycop>	anyone got ventrillo working?
06:21	<dfgas>	anyone have the problem that azureus just quits out once the window pops up

06:21	<Z__>	dunstabulos: alrighty, thx
06:22	<debaser>	Andr: wireless? pls be more specific
06:22	<foug>	debaser: now it wants me to install disc2 and cd1 won't eject. It says it's being used by another program, heh

06:22	<zaggynl>	Is there any way I can realise stable/high burning DVD speed in k3b?
06:22	<debaser>	foug: you must stop every program that may be using it, including bash. That means that must cd out of there in every console.
06:22	<oldude67>	synjet: this is what the terminal said error bad divice
06:22	<rellik>	what should I use as a very lightweight smtp server?  basically all I need it to do is forward everything to the google apps smtp server

06:25	<Z__>	is there a utorrent alternative, or does utorrent run perfect under wine??
06:25	<debaser>	lobosque: you must look for their sources in the proper place, in their project pages
06:25	<richieoxford>	i looked at the scribus web page, but i wanted something i could just download & use
06:25	<Andr>	I have a DELL inspiron 6400, card network: Intel pro wireless 3945
06:25	<debaser>	lobosque: you should google it
06:25	<debaser>	foug: how?
06:25	<richieoxford>	said it was for OSX and Windows too, but nothing I could just use
06:25	<kbrooks>	void^: explain what swappiness does. also, what happens when you set it to 0?
06:26	<dfgas>	stefg: yah just java 6 is installed, but firefox had shown that both were installed yet
06:26	<foug>	debaser: went back to user@host
06:26	<beni>	hey has anyone experience with Ubuntu + Laptops / Notebooks ? I'm not sure whether I should try to install it
06:26	<FLSimpsonKPT>	how can I install beryl on fiesty with an ATI Radeon X1300?
06:26	<neilther1>	it cant find the universe and multiverse websrtews
06:26	<Toyzruskid1976>	lol haven't used irc in years so i forget how to whisper :-(  there's no fix for highlighting the whole thing?  just figured how to backspace previous page
06:26	<ghettofred>	i used a tut to install a splash image in grub and it somehow doesnt work. while booting it gives me an error "failed to open"
06:26	<Andeh>	Ok thanks
06:26	<Andeh>	bye
06:26	<tmgomez>	what is the command to tell feisty server to download and install the desktop?
06:26	<mwe>	free will always report a total amount of RAM a little less than the physical amount because the kernel takes some
06:26	<neilther1>	it cant find the universe and multiverse websites
06:26	<antidrugue>	richieford: "sudo apt-get install scribus" ?
06:26	<richieoxford>	i need to give it to dummy users, they cant cope with building a version!
06:26	<kbrooks>	Toyzruskid1976, /query username
06:26	<debaser>	foug: very good, is a problem which happens very commonly
06:26	<vignesh>	synjet: It is unmuted
06:26	<stefg>	dfgas: then there's still a plugin package installed...
06:26	<FLSimpsonKPT>	how can I install beryl on fiesty with an ATI Radeon X1300?
06:26	<vignesh>	still no sound
06:26	<debaser>	lobosque: look for the .tar.bz2 sources
06:26	<beni>	tmgomez: sudo apt-get install gnome ?
06:26	<ardchoille>	tmgomez: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
06:26	<synjet>	flsimpsonkpt: synaptic
06:26	<tmgomez>	freenux ty
06:26	<neilther1>	and im also geting gpg errors when trying to upfate
06:26	<beni>	:P
06:26	<neilther1>	update
06:27	<tmgomez>	beni ty
06:27	<foug>	debaser: i tried running wine Installer.exe & so it would run in background but it won't let me it seems. It starts to but then once the WoW.exe runs and begins to install, i can't do anything in terminal
06:27	<debaser>	Aiwuu: are you there?
06:27	<void^>	kbrooks: it's a little complicated. i don't remember the exact definition/algorithm. see http://kerneltrap.org/node/3000 and similar googleable pages
06:27	<dfgas>	stefg: i messed with /etc/alturnitives and messed up a bunch of stuff then i recreated all the links that were on my laptop, now it shows just 6 is installed. but azureus still crashes. however nothing on firefox crashes anymore
06:27	<antidrugue>	tmgomez: "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
06:27	<richieoxford>	all this is too complicated for a "normal" user
06:27	<neilther1>	where can i get the default packagelist from?
06:27	<beni>	neilther1: w8 a minute
06:27	<ghettofred>	i used a tut to install a splash image in grub and it somehow doesnt work. while booting it gives me an error "failed to open". any suggestions?
06:27	<mwe>	!easysource | neilther1
06:27	<ubotu>	neilther1: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
06:27	<neilther1>	maybe my sources.list file is messed up
06:27	<aro>	richieoxford: not really
06:27	<dfgas>	stefg: blackdown wasn't installed through synaptic, it was a seflinstall
06:27	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: I know the Radeon X1300 I'snt supported by flrgx or whatever it is so if I just search through synaptic I can Install it?
06:27	<kbrooks>	void^, what happens when i set it to 0 or 100?
06:27	<capiira>	hmmm anyone know how to modify screensaver options ?
06:27	<antidrugue>	richieoxford: than use Synaptic package manager
06:27	<debaser>	foug: you must run it with a & at the end of the command
06:27	<neilther1>	ubotu: i need a defaul one
06:27	<ghettofred>	i used a tut to install a splash image in grub and it somehow doesnt work. while booting it gives me an error "failed to open". any suggestions?
06:27	<Z__>	stefg: type this in console and tell me the output  glxinfo | grep direct
06:27	<kbrooks>	void^, please explain.
06:27	<beni>	neilther1: or just sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
06:27	<neilther1>	that come with ubuntu
06:27	<stefg>	dfgas: so update-alternatives again, azu might still use the wrong one
06:28	<caribo>	!channels
06:28	<ubotu>	A list of Freenode channels is available via http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#channellist - Ubuntu related channels can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat
06:28	<kbrooks>	void^, i dont understand swappiness
06:28	<antidrugue>	neither1: go in System->Administration->Sources
06:28	<mwe>	!gksudo
06:28	<ubotu>	If you need to run graphical applications as root, use  gksudo , as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using  sudo <GUI-application>	
06:28	<dfgas>	hmmm
06:28	<neilther1>	beni: what should ii change in the file?
06:28	<debaser>	foug: the ampersand character (&), in bash, tells that the program should run in background.
06:28	<beni>	ubuntu on laptops, all help appreaciated
06:28	<Andr>	SO, My only problem is that I can not choose my WPA signal. I only can choosse WEP, my network card is an intel 3945 and I have ubuntu feisty.
06:28	<velko>	lobosque, you can download and study the source for any package with this command "apt-get source PKGNAME"
06:28	<kbrooks>	!gksudo
06:28	<kbrooks>	why?
06:28	<Toyzruskid1976>	omg this is great... Im just going to sit back and absorb all this knowledge share  (first week with ubuntu)
06:28	<synjet>	flsimpsonkpt: yes, i810 wasnt fully supported either, but it is working fine for me.. (bearable)
06:28	<void^>	kbrooks: if you set it to 0, it will try not to swap. if you set it to 100, it will swap program pages in favour of diskcache
06:28	<lobosque>	velko thanks
06:28	<ardchoille>	neilther1: Don't run sudo gedit. better to use gksudo gedit
06:28	<richieoxford>	there must be a way of having things so that users can just quickly "install" software without any technical knowledge, otherwise i cant promote it instead of windows :(
06:28	<ghettofred>	i used a tut to install a splash image in grub and it somehow doesnt work. while booting it gives me an error "failed to open". any suggestions?
06:28	<void^>	kbrooks: it will of course always swap if your programs request more memory than your system has.
06:28	<Andr>	hello,  =   =  ??  ?
06:29	<lobosque>	velko are you a programmer?
06:29	<retarded-brb>	ok sofar for the md5 checksums the compared = equal
06:29	<aro>	richieoxford: There is, it's called pop in Live CD and let it install everything for you
06:29	<kbrooks>	void^, if you set it to 100, it will swap program pages in favour of diskcache # what does that mean?
06:29	<velko>	lobosque, yes
06:29	<Z__>	richieoxford: synaptic, automatix
06:29	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: could you step me through what I have to do to install it?? I've only gotten it working once on an older version of ubuntu and then it started to fail
06:29	<antidrugue>	richieoxford: that's pretty much what i told you: use Synaptic
06:29	<debaser>	lobosque: if they're written in python, an interpreted language, you can directly analyze the executable surely, but it's not the same with C or C++ programs.
06:29	<retarded-brb>	ok sofar for the md5 checksums the compared = equal   ( antidrugue
06:29	<aro>	richieoxford: Instead of complaining, go research
06:29	<richieoxford>	yes, but that doesnt have scribus on it does it?
06:29	<kbrooks>	void^, i understand swap space == virtual memory. virtual memory is a extension to RAM.
06:29	<antidrugue>	richieoxford: System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager
06:29	<lobosque>	the sudoku game file in /usr/games/ has this line: from gnome_sudoku.gnome_sudoku import start_game
06:29	<kbrooks>	void^, am i right there?
06:29	<Andr>	ok, I think is better google., thank you everybody
06:29	<Andr>	see you
06:30	<void^>	kbrooks: it means it will swap out those nasty 50mb that firefox eats in favour of caching files. swappiness is basically about active pages to diskcache ratio.
06:30	<vignesh>	synjet: any idea what could be the problem ?
06:30	<lobosque>	velko where i can find the imported file?
06:30	<antidrugue>	richieoxford: sure it does
06:30	<Aiwuu>	yesyes
=== doc| is now known as docMuerto
06:30	<kbrooks>	void^, so that means that these 50 mb won't be ... ?
06:30	<Aiwuu>	debaser
06:30	<debaser>	Aiwuu: so
06:30	<neilther1>	can someone please ive me heire sources.lis fine if the have the default one?
06:30	<ghettofred>	i used a tut to install a splash image in grub and it somehow doesnt work. while booting it gives me an error "failed to open". any suggestions?
06:30	<neilther1>	give*
06:30	<debaser>	Aiwuu: how can you access the computer with the problem?
06:30	<antidrugue>	richieoxford: it has everything, make sure all the repositories are enabled in System->Administration->Software Repositories
06:30	<leroi_>	hey guys im using gdesklets and when i have it running and open firefox it takes me to www.%u.com instead of my home page
06:30	<sebrock>	If I would like to make script that performs a single mouseclick straight on the desktop at startup, what is the command for that mouse click?
06:30	<Toyzruskid1976>	is ubuntu by nature more washed out visually then windows? or do I need to figure out how to tweak the graphics on a laptop to make it sharper?
06:30	<Z__>	richieoxford: synaptic does have scribus
06:30	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: could you step me through what I have to do to install it?? I've only gotten it working once on an older version of ubuntu and then it started to fail
06:30	<tmgomez>	i am running feisty server I need to download and install desktop because it is not on the cd how do I go about doing that?
06:30	<debaser>	Aiwuu: with windows or another linux installation?
06:30	<Aiwuu>	well... im in the hard drive of the pc...
06:30	<Aiwuu>	in windows
06:30	<Aiwuu>	windows
06:30	<oldude67>	uboto: where is teach channel?
06:30	<Bartcelon2>	roaming for wireless...  when I have roaming mode enables I can not put in a check box in the setting for wireless connection. If instead I use manual configuration I can select essid but then I am forced to use WEP key which I do not use.  I feel stupid as I can not find anything about this in the WIFI docs. Can a smart person help me feel less stupid? Or confirm that I am stupid not to be able to find the documentation on this
06:31	<antidrugue>	!windows
06:31	<ubotu>	For help with Microsoft Windows, please visit ##windows or your nearest mental health institute. See http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1 http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm and !equivalents
06:31	<velko>	lobosque, the python modules reside in /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages/PKG. with the new debian python policy these are symlinks to /usr/share/pycentral
06:31	<neilther1>	is anyone running edgy that has a default sources.list file?
06:31	<oldude67>	oops
06:31	<stefg>	leroi_: edit the starter and remove the '%u' from the command
06:31	<darnell>	im trying to sync my phone and at synce.org it says..
06:31	<kbrooks>	<sebrock>	If I would like to make script that performs a single mouseclick straight on the desktop at startup, what is the command for that mouse click? # hmmm ... ?
06:31	<darnell>	 You need to have CONFIG_USB_NET_CDCETHER compiled either into the kernel, or as a module, in your kernel config. Located in Device Drivers ->	USB support ->	USB Gadget support ->	Ethernet Gadget
06:31	<aro>	Toyzruskid1976: what do you mean in particular about "washed out" ?
06:31	<synjet>	flsimpsonkpt: open add/remove s/w and then type beryl, then tick the ones you want (like beryl manager etc.)
06:31	<debaser>	Aiwuu: do you have a linux live cd?
06:31	<darnell>	how do i do that?
06:31	<void^>	kbrooks: for example: if you have a system with only 256mb memory it might make the system faster to swap out firefox when you don't use it right now, but it means you'll have to live with a delay when you switch back to firefox. swappiness allows you to control that.
06:31	<retarded-brb>	antidrugue md5 check passed fine .. and now ??
06:31	<vignesh>	anyone having a sigmatel audio card ?
06:31	<sebrock>	kbrooks, anything you didnt understand?
06:31	<Aiwuu>	yes
06:31	<velko>	lobosque, if you are curious you have to read at least some introductional tutorial about python and pygtk. else you wont get it
06:31	<kbrooks>	void^, so, i cann set it to 50 percent for a good compromise
06:32	<antidrugue>	retarded: hum... than your CD was probably fine... you say it doesn't install though?
06:32	<tmgomez>	i am running feisty server I need to download and install desktop because it is not on the cd how do I go about doing that?
06:32	<antidrugue>	retarded: what was the error again?
06:32	<kbrooks>	sebrock, use nautilus to "click" on things on the desktop
06:32	<Toyzruskid1976>	graphics are "pastel"
06:32	<void^>	kbrooks: that's about what it is by default. andrew morton recommends 100 ;)
06:32	<retarded-brb>	antidrugue yes it stays at 75 % "configuring wvdial" tryed to install twice
06:32	<erUSUL>	tmgomez: 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
06:32	<ghettofred>	anyone wants to help me with my splash image in grub?
06:32	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: don't I need the emerald theme manager too??
06:32	<techuser_>	Seveas the Ubuntu IRC channels says you are the contact to refer questions to. Is that correct?
06:32	<tmgomez>	erUSUL it wont work
06:32	<Z__>	ghettofred: whats the prob
06:32	<kbrooks>	sebrock, or do you want to stimulate a right click?
06:32	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you must boot the CD and check your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
06:32	<sebrock>	kbrooks, ok then, how to make that into a script
06:32	<sebrock>	yes
06:32	<kbrooks>	techuser_, what type of questions?
06:32	<sebrock>	no left
06:33	<lobosque>	velko i still can't find the imported file
06:33	<erUSUL>	tmgomez: error msg?
06:33	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: don't I need the emerald theme manager too??
06:33	<cyzie>	where does ubuntu stored its inittab?
06:33	<kbrooks>	sebrock, what precisely do you need to open up in nautilus?
06:33	<debaser>	Aiwuu: to do it you must first mount your ubuntu partition (obviously after the live cd is running and you have access yo a console)
06:33	<kbrooks>	cyzie, /etc
06:33	<synjet>	flsimpsonkpt: yes, but thats for skins etc.. not basic

06:34	<sebrock>	kbrooks, acutally nothing, I need to perform a left mouseclick as soon as desktop is shown because it makes a certain applet not to sit on top.
06:34	<aro>	tmgomez: do not paste large amounts of text

06:35	<neilther1>	i cant acess half of thepackage servers...
06:35	<antidrugue>	retarded: take it off, or disable it in the BIOS then
06:35	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: so I don't really need it. Its just for If I wanted to have some fancy themes
06:35	<debaser>	Aiwuu: pls try to use "debaser:" before a line that you are saying to me, it's easier to read
06:35	<Aiwuu>	ok

06:35	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: so I don't really need it. Its just for If I wanted to have some fancy themes

06:35	<tmgomez>	erUSUL 1 sec

06:35	<neilther1>	now whn i run apt-get update, it get a bunch of 404 not found
06:35	<kbrooks>	<MoxJet>	Anyone know a good guide how to mount an ubuntu installer iso over LAN, so you can install it on other computers without burnnig a cd? # trivial

06:35	<gils>	anyone here on rogers in canada. i am getting some strange speed issues downloading that feisty DVD iso.
06:35	<antidrugue>	retarded: come back if you have any issue
06:35	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ubuntu xd
06:36	<retarded-brb>	ok
06:36	<debaser>	Aiwuu: 7.04?
06:36	<Aiwuu>	yes
06:36	<sebrock>	kbrooks, is that possible?
06:36	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: so I don't really need it. Its just for If I wanted to have some fancy themes
06:36	<synjet>	flsimpsonkpt: yes, but it wouldnt hurt in installing
06:36	<techuser_>	kbrooks I am trying to install a .sh file that says it need a 6.06 32 bit environment and I am on 7.04 also a tar.gz file that expands to a single binari file that I do not know what do with?
06:36	<Aiwuu>	i should boot from the cd now?
06:36	<misfit_toy>	does that "startupmanager" usplash/grub utility behave well with feisty?
06:36	<FLSimpsonKPT>	synjet: ok I'll add it then
06:36	<debaser>	Aiwuu: then you must boot the CD. When you have access to the desktop, you must open the Application menu
06:36	<mikere>	gils: I'm in canada - but am not currently downloading from a canadian repository - mebbe I'll check an update download
06:36	<adaptr>	techuser_: perhaps if you explained what it *is*
06:37	<kbrooks>	MoxJet, ping

06:37	<kbrooks>	MoxJet, online?
06:37	<debaser>	Aiwuu: or take notes of the steps and do them by yourself.

06:56	<JinXx>	I have a question, If I swap from Windows XP to Ubuntu, will my computer get faster? Will games give higher FPS ?
06:56	<Z__>	hermatize: for games trust me just stick to windows for that, thats why i have dual boot
06:56	<peepssalot>	Harr1, what is the specific problem with your mouse
06:56	<aro>	JinXx, that's a rather generic question
06:56	<neilther1>	antidruge: sure, but just so you know, it worked last night before i killed the power to my system while it was writin to the hard drive
06:56	<neilther1>	because it stoppd responding
06:56	<bliz0r>	Can anyone name me some good docks? Needs to be easy to install too :)
06:56	<antidrugue>	oh....
06:56	<neilther1>	i don know if that will change anything
06:56	<delire>	julian-: some issue with the parallels and the video driver on your apple machine.
06:56	<misfit_toy>	before I reboot, I'd like to ask one more time, I've used "startupmanager" which is supposedly compatible with feisty now to change my usplash, but I'd like to hear from someone that this is true before I reboot. :)
06:56	<debaser>	JinXx: actually linux drivers are better than windows ones, but that's not true every single one, since some are closed and can't be correctly developed
06:56	<neilther1>	i havent change the conf file
06:57	<Harr1>	i have a bluettoth stack in my laptop... when i run hcitool scan he found the mouse, but how, can i connect them automatically, or what have I to add in the xorg.conf?
06:57	<antidrugue>	neither1: that's suspicious, you are right
06:57	<jrib>	andi5: ~/.local/share/ and ~/.config/menus  I believe.  It's written in python if you want ot be more thorough
06:57	<delire>	hermatize: SLI works fine with Ubuntu.
06:57	<Ranpha1>	antidrugue: and now....i'm going to figure out why my Girlfriend is so bad in cooking see you and thanks

06:57	<furby_>	Has anyone successfully installed feisty fawn on  a macbook pro?

06:58	<julian->	Furby: In parallels, I have.
06:58	<neilther1>	if ts a corruptedd file, how can i fix it?
06:58	<aro>	JinXx: You can't just install Counter Strike on Linux without the use of emulators
06:58	<KalleDK>	!fonts >	KalleDK
06:58	<debaser>	JinXx: it depends in a lot of factors.
06:58	<furby_>	How about in a dual boot?
06:58	<JinXx>	Alright, Thanks for the help!
06:58	<delire>	julian-: no idea, the mac i use solo-boots Ubuntu and i've never looked into parallels.

07:24	<Hattori>	anybody has any pureftpd experience please?
07:24	<qebab>	okay, thanks
07:24	<delire>	qebab: eek, sounds like a mission and given the face Linux uses a different set of compilers, i don't know if it'd be worth it no? why not look into kdevelop instead?
07:24	<antidrugue>	qebab: doesn't eclipse-cdt fits the bill ?
07:24	<andi5>	joeyj: i can tell you that vmware-player works for me... i downloaded a blank image and .vmx file and modified it to my likings.... kvm and xen somehow do not install winxp for me, right now... hope to get that fixed someday
07:24	<Dante123>	hi all....I have a netgear USB wireless adapter...after installing feisty...two wireless adapters show up.....one is wlan0 and the other is something like wmaster0 or something......why two?  There was only one adapter visible under edgy.....and the adapter doesn't seem to remember the wep encruption....I have to reset it each time I boot up....any thoughts?
07:24	<debaser>	VoX: if anyone here can help you look in the documentation at the proftpd homepage, as well as the documentation provided with it.
07:24	<ffm>	Hi, I think my PASSIVE FTP is not working...
07:24	<rbs-tito>	Dante123: the driver are probably not installed properly, try theNDISwrapper route.
07:24	<Artemis3>	Alexiel, /usr/bin/mozilla-thunderbird
07:24	<qebab>	antidrugue: it's more that I wanted to use what I'm already familiar with if it wouldn't be hard to set up :) I've got no problem using another IDE if I have to
07:25	<Alexiel>	Thanks Artemis3
07:25	<delire>	Dante123: is it the WG111v2?
07:25	<qebab>	delire: Kdevelop is good?
07:25	<noelferreira>	how can i undo ldconfig comand?
07:25	<joeamined>	hi
07:25	<joeamined>	i have a very annoying problem
07:25	<Dante123>	yes delire...it is
07:25	<qebab>	I'll take a look at it
07:25	<joeamined>	i installed ubuntu feisty from the live cd
07:25	<andi5>	noelferreira: i do not think that is possible
07:25	<joeyj>	andi5: thanks.
07:25	<debaser>	Aiwuu: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Stage2-errors.html
07:25	<joeamined>	and i get the error failed to set locale
07:25	<Dante123>	any suggestions?
07:25	<delire>	qebab: i use Vim but have heard VS users say that it's the closest to a replacement in Linux.
07:25	<antidrugue>	qebab: eclipse is quite nice, please very popular in enterprise

=== root___ is now known as mirak
07:26	<rbs-tito>	Does anyone know of some good photo printing software?
07:26	<debaser>	Aiwuu: are you sure there wasn't any problem with the installation of feisty
07:26	<debaser>	?
07:26	<mirak>	I have a problem with feisty on ppc, X server fail to start with my radeon8500
07:26	<delire>	qebab: true, Eclipse is another option. i develop in Python, C and C++ for Linux and use Vim, but it's not for everyone :/
07:26	<joeyj>	qebab: what kind of development are you doing?
07:26	<Artemis3>	Dante123, interesting, btw never use wep, its as unsafe as using no encryption ;)
07:26	<Dante123>	i don't want to use ndiswrapper....if the card was working fine under edgy....with native stuff
07:26	<tuna>	does anyone have problems with sound on an imac?
07:26	<noelferreira>	andi5: are you sure andi5? so all the links outside /usr/lib are broken isn't it?
07:26	<Aiwuu>	debaser, no problems :S
07:26	<mirak>	delire: there cdt a plugin for eclipse to edit c and c++
07:27	<qebab>	joeyj: nothing in specific (haskell, python, learning c++) as a hobby
07:27	<andi5>	noelferreira: huh? why that?
07:27	<mirak>	I have a problem with feisty on ppc, X server fail to start with my radeon8500
07:27	<antidrugue>	exactly, eclipse-cdt
07:27	<Aiwuu>	debaser, maybe this line: root		(hd1,0) ?
07:27	<delire>	mirak: yes i've heard. i just don't like Eclipse
07:27	<qebab>	so it's not an 'enteprise' need or anything like that
07:27	<mirak>	delire: how dare you ?
07:27	<Dante123>	Artemis3.....like a padlock.....it keeps the honest crooks out.........that's about all I expect from it.
07:27	<Faolchu>	Is there a way to have a list of users available in a drop-down menu at the login window?
07:27	<Aiwuu>	debaser, maybe if i change to (sd2,0)?
07:27	<delire>	mirak: hehe, i've been using Vim for around 8 years now. you can pry it from my cold dead hands.
07:27	<antidrugue>	delire: blasphemy
07:27	<Artemis3>	Dante123, not really, check the proggies to crack into a wep wifi...
07:27	<qebab>	and you are quite right delire, emacs and vim don't seem to be my thing :) a bit too strange for me still
07:27	<noelferreira>	because i do that and know i can't run some programs that need some librarys files andi5
07:27	<oo_seven>	can somebody suggest an easy to configure, lightweight http proxy server & dns server (that will just forward the dns requests) ?
07:27	<sigfever>	i need a recommendation for a good firewall
07:27	<debaser>	Aiwuu: grub doesn't manage the disks the same as linux
07:27	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
07:27	<mirak>	delire: vim is for cavemans
07:28	<joeyj>	qebab: in that case, i agree with the others... i think eclipse (+cdt) would be good for you
07:28	<MoxJet>	i'm installing vmware server but I get an error doing /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl about not having a vmmon module... this is what i get http://pastebin.ca/452962
07:28	<rbs-tito>	sigfever: firestarter?
07:28	<qebab>	though I am sure they are very good when you get used to it
07:28	<qebab>	okay
07:28	<Dante123>	delire.....what do you know about netgear wg111v2?
07:28	<qebab>	I'll try that
07:28	<delire>	mirak: antidrugue i tried Eclipse, but found it too bulky and unneccessarily confusing.
07:28	<qebab>	thanks guys
07:28	<Aiwuu>	debaser, :/
07:28	<ffm>	HOW CAN I tell if my camera works w/ linux>?
07:28	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can try it, but first make sure it's correct
07:28	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
07:28	<sizzam>	if you add something to hosts.deny, do you have to source the file or something for it to go into effect?
07:28	<sigfever>	thanks
07:28	<debaser>	Aiwuu: surely it is.
07:28	<andi5>	noelferreira: i think that typically every installation of a library ends with running `ldconfig', so i do not understand that :)
07:28	<delire>	Dante123: i know that people have problems with this particular model. is it the same as yours?
07:28	<antidrugue>	delire: just joking, i like VIM too, but i believe it many not be very efficient for large project
07:29	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can check the documentation of GRUB.
07:29	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
07:29	<harris>	Hello. I need to have ubuntu server edition upload a file every 10 minutes to a server. I have ssh accses to both, how would i do this?
07:29	<Aiwuu>	debaser, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17088/
07:29	<neilther1>	delire: after unning that command, my computer isn booting anymore
07:29	<delire>	antidrugue: i've coded a few biggish projects in Vim and found it fine with a good code browser, like ctags.
07:29	<Faolchu>	Is there a way to have a list of users available in a drop-down menu at the login window?
07:29	<MonsieurBon>	can i remove laptop-detect and laptop-mode-tools on a desktop??
07:29	<joeamined>	how can i fix that ?
07:29	<delire>	neilther1: what command?
07:29	<Artemis3>	harris, cron?
07:29	<Crav>	has anyone tried the mozilla calender program (sunbird)?
07:29	<Dante123>	Artemis3...you are missing my point......I put wep simply to keep my neighbour from using my wifi.......you know......as for some hacking neighbour....well.....they'd probably crack anything anyway....and there are few if any like that in my hood....now what about netgear usb
07:29	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but I think that if the problem was with that, it should then appear another error (at least that happened to me).
07:29	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you sure your CD is good?
07:29	<neilther1>	touch /forcefsck
07:29	<qebab>	antidrugue: one of my friend usually says that Vim is for sys admin kinds of people, emacs is for crazy people and always adds as an afterthought that he uses emacs :)
07:29	<dor>	Crav, I did
07:29	<delire>	neilther1: i never told you to run that.
07:29	<ffm>	Crav: I reccomend Thunderbird w/ sunbird addon. Or GoogleCal.
07:29	<delire>	neilther1: read the backlog
07:30	<neilther1>	whats that.
07:30	<Faolchu>	v_v
07:30	<neilther1>	?
07:30	<harris>	how?
07:30	<harris>	Artemis3: how?
07:30	<andi5>	harris: do you need precision? ... while true; do do_upload ; sleep 10 ; done loop might work as well
07:30	<antidrugue>	ouak, emacs, euhhh
07:30	<Crav>	ffm: is the addon like a plugin, or a wholly seperate program?
07:30	<delire>	neilther1: all i told you was to install libnewt. you're confused with someone else.
07:30	<abtinf>	can someone point me in the right direction... i have a fresh install of fiesty. During boot, it reaches the screen where the filling bar indicates boot progress. Every time, it reaches about a third of the way and becomes non-responsive. I can then make it move by pressing ctrl+alt+del (other keys seem to have no effect). Is there a way i can turn on logging or get rid of the graphical screen to see what is actually happening?
07:30	<andi5>	harris: i mean 600, of course :)
07:30	<ffm>	Crav: It is an extention.
07:30	<harris>	I don't need precision
07:30	<neilther1>	delire: do u know what to do now?
07:30	<debaser>	Aiwuu: but it works with windows doesn't it?
07:30	<Crav>	ffm: alright, thanks a lot, i'll check out both options
07:30	<Aiwuu>	debaser, but i only get: Error 17: cannot mount selected partition :S and please hit any key.... and then im in grub again :S
07:30	<neilther1>	why its not booting after i ran that?
07:30	<Aiwuu>	debaser, nope
07:30	<Artemis3>	Dante123, your neighbour can use your wep as if you had used no encryption, determined people will have very hard time with wap/wap2 (psk or not) if you use a decent password
07:30	<ffm>	Crav: They will be able to help you better at irc.mozilla.org #firefox or #thunderbird.
07:30	<harris>	Could you repeat that command?
07:30	<Aiwuu>	debaser, i load windows from the hd
07:31	<Dante123>	i have another usb wifi adapter.....I ll try it.....it uses zyxes or something like that....
07:31	<Aiwuu>	debaser, and linux from de sd
07:31	<Tarkus>	anyone know how if helix player can read all the media types that VLC can?
07:31	<Pitel_laptop>	what's the name of the packeg for psi ssl support?
07:31	<andi5>	harris: while true; do do_upload ; sleep 600 ; done
07:31	<harris>	Thank you.
=== Marcopolo1974ch is now known as wireless_trouble
07:31	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
07:31	<Artemis3>	Dante123, just an advise, don't worry if you don't mind
07:31	<antidrugue>	abtinf: perhaps you can try the alternate CD
07:31	<joeamined>	please can you help ???
07:31	<naknomik>	I am trying ekiga. Can a windows user talk to me over Ekiga? Is Ekiga or other Windows application available for Ekiga?
07:31	<abtinf>	antidrugue: you mean install from the alt-cd?
07:31	<grayman>	abtinf, you can disable splash by editing the entry in grub
07:32	<wireless_trouble>	Is there a tool in the ubuntu which shows all availeble wirless networks
07:32	<Dante123>	I may get around to using WAP......but at the time I was setting things up......WEP was only option with my particular adapter and linux.......now that has changed..........however......to the best of my knowledge......WEP has kept innocent people out......
07:32	<debaser>	Aiwuu: GRUB is very powerful and lets you change boot configuration withouth changing configuration files. Thus, you can test boot configs withouth having to reboot to the live CD, edit the file and reboot.
07:32	<delire>	neilther1: i have no idea what you're doing sorry. you haven't given any information or responded to what i was asking.
07:32	<antidrugue>	abting: yaya
07:32	<abtinf>	grayman: ok, i'll check it out
07:32	<joeamined>	am i invisible ??
07:32	<Faolchu>	Anyone? =(
07:32	<joeamined>	no one wants to help ??
07:32	<antidrugue>	joeamined: yes invisible mode
07:32	<andi5>	!networkmanager >	wireless_trouble
07:32	<grayman>	abo, i assume that the system is installed
07:32	<delire>	neilther1: as i said earlier, i don't know what your problem is, you're not giving any information. first you said you can't get into X, that libnewt was missing, that you have an IO error trying to isntall it, that you moved it manually, that the file is now corrupted and now your system is corrupted.
07:32	<ffm>	joeamined: Yes, I cannot see you.
07:32	<antidrugue>	joeamined: what was your question again?
07:32	<grayman>	abtinf, i assume that the system is installed
07:32	<abo>	grayman, pardon?
07:32	<delire>	neilther1: frankly i have no idea what you're upto there.
07:32	<joeamined>	when i launch ubuntu feisty from the live cd i get the error failed to set locale and i get a system half french half english
07:33	<debaser>	Aiwuu: if you think that it could be solved by changing hd to sd, then reboot and, once in GRUB, press 'e', and edit the configuration. Is very straighforward.
07:33	<grayman>	abo, wrong person :)
07:33	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i will do?xd
07:33	<Artemis3>	Dante123, try one of the cracking programs and youll see how terribly easy is to fool a wep wifi.
07:33	<Jabop>	Hi, what is a good tool to record a desktop?
07:33	<antidrugue>	joeamined: i already answered: are you use the CD is fine? are you installing from the live CD or alternate CD ?
07:33	<abo>	grayman, no prob
07:33	<Aiwuu>	debaser, so, i will change hd for sd, and if it doesnt work i will back to the livecd and edit it to hd agian
07:33	<omaar>	joeamined: maybe the system is not yet completely translated to french
07:33	<debaser>	Aiwuu: that's exactly what you shouldn't do, its too much time.,
07:34	<Aiwuu>	debaser, aff XD
07:34	<antidrugue>	joeamined: are you trying to install in french ?
07:34	<Aiwuu>	debaser, what i can do then?
07:34	<Dante123>	i'm not into hacking....but I believe you Artemis3.....its just that until now...it has been a low priority to change....and I figured WEP at least kept some "innocent users" from hitching a ride on my wifi......at some point I should "upgrade" my security....
07:34	<bliz0r>	Anyone got experience with akamaru? I got problems with dragging launchers to the bar/removing them
07:34	<debaser>	Aiwuu: you can reboot, and once in GRUB, press 'e' and edit the boot configuration.
07:34	<CheesyJedi>	how do I edit the settings for ubuntu's new "desktop effects"?
07:34	<joeamined>	antidrugue, yes
07:34	<debaser>	Aiwuu: there you can test without loosing much time.
07:34	<colbert>	How do I completely remove a package?
07:34	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ok ok
07:34	<ffm>	PASSIVE FTP seems to be broken here. Can anyone help me?
07:35	<antidrugue>	bliz0r: yes it doesn't work very well, you are better off editing the file populate-dock.sh and rerun it
07:35	<joeamined>	i'm using the live cd
07:35	<delire>	colbert: sudo dpkg -P packagename
07:35	<chrispche>	Hello can anyone help me. I've been using Gnome on Ubuntu for 3 months and have just installed KDE. But it is at a higher resolution. How do you change the res?
07:35	<chrispche>	Thanks.
07:35	<andi5>	colbert: --purge it
07:35	<Artemis3>	Dante123, it is a very bad surprise, wep gives a false sense of security, it should be removed...
07:35	<antidrugue>	joeamined: i haven't try the installation in french unfortunately
07:35	<delire>	colbert: or, sudo apt-get remove packagename --purge
07:35	<Dante123>	netgear can be bastards....they give one name and number to cards with up to three different chipsents etc.   like russian roulette....you hope you didn't get the "bad" one.....
07:35	<antidrugue>	perhaps you can try #ubuntu-fr

07:35	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.

07:35	<debaser>	Aiwuu: meanwhile, I'll search for some documentation ok?

07:36	<colbert>	delire: thanks !
07:36	<delire>	colbert: np
07:36	<Artemis3>	ffm, yeah, thats a problem... maybe use them for public wifi only? ;)
07:36	<ffm>	hod do i COMPLETLY DISABLE root login except by sudo?
07:36	<Dante123>	ffm.....exactly what my issue was when I first setup my wifi.......Artemis3 must have all brand new and shiny HW......while we plebians have to deal with legacy stuff...... ;-)
07:36	<kkathman>	Is there any other chat client for gnome besides X-Chat ?
07:36	<antidrugue>	ffm: it is disabled by default
07:36	<surviver>	^marcus^, if u know that you help me 2 alot :p i have mx518 but they said logitech didnt make any drivers for linux...

07:37	<sebrock>	no hint on how to create a mouseclick with a script?
07:37	<andi5>	ffm: are you able to login as root somewhere?
07:37	<Dante123>	So are you using WEP...Artemis3?
07:37	<xeshm>	sudo su?
07:37	<omaar>	joeamined: vous pouvez poser votre question l-bas: #ubuntu-fr
07:37	<ffm>	antidrugue: But my RKCHECKER says it is.
07:37	<ffm>	andi5: antidrugue:    Checking for allowed root login... Watch out Root login possible. Possible risk!
07:37	<delire>	sebrock: you could probably jack into the gnome input events stream somehow.
07:37	<Artemis3>	Dante123, no, i simply read how the wep exploit works, its sad; worse than css ;)

07:38	<ramirand>	Hi all. I'm switching from Mandriva to 7.04 - I currently run a small website, as well as use it for a desktop. Is it better to start with server and add the desktop packages, or start with desktop and add the web stuff?
07:38	<antidrugue>	you won't be able too, the password is unset by default
07:38	<taggie>	Artemis3, wide open wifi is fine, as long as it's firewalled from your wired network, it adds a certain amount of plausible deniability in case of bad things happening on(or from) your network.
07:38	<sebrock>	SDL, your going overkill here, Im just wanna create one click on the desktop upon boot
07:38	<delire>	wireless_trouble: are you using a realtek chipset?

07:39	<surviver>	igge, mount -o ro,remount /media/(path)
07:40	<wireless_trouble>	delire how can i start them .. I am new to linux
07:40	<mikere>	ramirand: I would generally say start with server and then add - since that ends up with the least amount of extra stuff installed.  Probably won't make all that much difference in the end but can avoid having some vulnerable desktop apps installed on a server.  Maybe....
07:40	<ramirand>	mikere: Thx.
07:40	<DShepherd>	1400+ users... wow!
07:40	<xeshm>	:(
07:40	<delire>	wireless_trouble: this is a known problem with realtek cards: http://loktarogar.blogspot.com/2007/04/take-that-network-manager.html
07:40	<Dante123>	so my argmument is not that WEP is so good.....I'm sure your hack info is right....just that it is better than leaving it wide open.....
07:40	<mirak>	andi5: hum that's not the good name, but there is mac spoofer, I already used it
07:40	<antidrugue>	things are going to fast here
07:40	<igge>	surviver: how can I make that happen automatically?
07:40	<Dante123>	Certainly there are better alternatives.....though....so your point is well taken.
07:40	<xeshm>	hello?
07:40	<xeshm>	pls
07:40	<abtinf>	grayman: i disabled the splash in grub and the boot worked flawlessly. Do you have any suggestion for how I can figure out while the splash screen is on, so that I can submit a bug report?
07:40	<wireless_trouble>	delire . thanks I will have a look there
07:41	<Selenolycus>	I need some help. I selected the Human List login theme, as well as enabled Remote Login - and now X keeps crashing at startup.
07:41	<surviver>	igge, dont know u can try to make a script for it ... :s
07:41	<kemik>	is "ddd" available in any repository?
07:41	<ffm>	Dante123: But, it provides newbies w/ false sence of security
07:41	<ramirand>	Dante123: I've had WEP on for years... no hacks that I can report. But then again, my neighbor operates wide open -- who'd bother hacking me? :)
07:41	<mikere>	Dante123: you are correct - even broken WEP is better than nothing at all
07:41	<grayman>	abtinf, you say that it stops at 1/3 of the way?
07:41	<abtinf>	grayman: yes
07:41	<bongo_boy>	ummm hi guys... does anyone how to fix the 3D cube desktop effect thing? It worked once, but never again - I have a mobility ATI 9600, using the Xorg driver...
07:41	<delire>	wireless_trouble: this should sort it out. gnome's network-admin can be found in system->preferences i think.
07:41	<ffm>	kemik: Yes.
07:41	<taggie>	Dante123; i'd say wide-open is fine. you shouldn't be using cleartext protocols, and you shouldn't bridge directly to your private network, but sharing is nice :)
07:41	<ffm>	kemik: Sudo apt-get install ddd
07:41	<grayman>	abtinf, it's probably fsck
07:41	<igge>	surviver: yeah... but how to make the script execute?
07:41	<andi5>	does someone have a 5 meter wlan cable for me?

07:42	<rmd_>	bongo_boy, i had a problem once and what i did was this: disable, increase workspace # to 4 and reenable
07:42	<abtinf>	grayman: but it doesnt happen with the splash screen off?
07:42	<antidrugue>	andi5: i have a few 75 footer here :)
07:42	<bongo_boy>	thanks rmd
07:42	<dwhsix>	hmm - trying to upgrade from 6.04 to 6.10, keep getting "Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2 Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)"
07:42	<grayman>	abtinf, well... you rebooted it
07:42	<igge>	surviver: heh... but I mean automatically when usb sticks are inserted
07:42	<Dante123>	That's true.....ffm.......there is still some security....although not very good.  The false part...well....the newbies will have to learn about that on their own....and maybe the hard way......
07:42	<dwhsix>	thoughts?
07:42	<andi5>	antidrugue: great, where can i download that? :)
07:42	<wireless_trouble>	delire I will try to find it .... thanks
07:42	<Aiwuu>	debaser, im in ubuntu now!
07:42	<delire>	wireless_trouble: many others with the same card and the same problem. should be fixed shortly, but in the meantime this is your best option.
07:43	<antidrugue>	andi5: i'll just flush them, and pump really hard off your sink
07:43	<grayman>	abtinf, that "bug" is already filed i believe
07:43	<Aiwuu>	debaser, i changed hd1 to hd0 :O!
07:43	<rthriller>	Hello
07:43	<abtinf>	grayman: ok, thanks a lot
07:43	<debaser>	Aiwuu: good

07:43	<Crav>	is it at all possible to migrate my old windows thunderbird mail into linux?
07:43	<J^zon>	need assistance in setting up a home network between a desktop on ubuntu and a laptop on windows...
07:43	<Artemis3>	Crav, yes
07:43	<Aiwuu>	debaser, so... i change in the grub main.list that file: the hd1 to hd0?
07:43	<debaser>	Aiwuu: sorry, I should have seen that since the beginning, but I'm tired and busy right now, I hope I was helpful.
07:43	<Selenolycus>	: I need some help. I selected the Human List login theme, as well as enabled Remote Login - and now X keeps crashing at startup.
07:43	<andi5>	nice, ubuntu makes it possible
07:43	<Aiwuu>	debaser, a lot ;)
07:44	<debaser>	Aiwuu: exactly
07:44	<xeshm>	:(
07:44	<Aiwuu>	debaser, ok :p
07:44	<xeshm>	hey!!!
07:44	<Aiwuu>	debaser, thanks :P
07:44	<xeshm>	<----
07:44	<xeshm>	?
07:44	<igge>	surviver: hm won't do.. :) But it should be possible to configure HAL or something...
07:44	<Selenolycus>	Is there a way to reset these settings via terminal?
07:44	<joshjosh>	debaser, Pixies fan/
07:44	<debaser>	Aiwuu: ur welcome
07:44	<delire>	Crav: yes

07:44	<debaser>	Aiwuu: the explanation is thath GRUB was trying to boot surely the swap partition.
07:44	<nameless`>	how to fix that one? :|
07:44	<delire>	antidrugue: oh
07:45	<ffm>	antidrugue: Please go to #ubuntu-offtopic for that sort of chatter.
07:45	<debaser>	joshjosh: yep
07:45	<Crav>	more specific: HOW can i migrate my old windows thunderbird mail into linux?
07:45	<antidrugue>	ffm: haha sure
07:45	<Kazol>	What is the normal idle load average? I'm getting ~0.5 with all applets and widgets running on a 500Mhz. CPU.
07:45	<debaser>	Aiwuu: I'm happy for u.
07:45	<delire>	nameless`: perhaps see #vnc if it exists..
07:45	<surviver>	igge, i know it is possible maybe somewhere in fstab?
07:45	<nameless`>	nobody in vnc :(
07:45	<surviver>	igge, yes thats possible
07:45	<Selenolycus>	installing kdm seems to have fixed it.
07:45	<Selenolycus>	thanks all the help guys
07:45	<delire>	Crav: AFAIK thunderbird stores mail in the mbox format, so you can just import it into whatever client you're using in Linux.
07:45	<taggie>	Kazol, there really isn't a "normal" idle load average. That said, .5 is low enough you shouldn't be waiting on much.
07:46	<nameless`>	delire i followed that howto on the ubuntu webby but i keep walking in that error :s
07:46	<FrankX>	i use a headless box and VNCserver to view the desktop but can only get 800x600 resolution, how do i increase this to 1024x768 or 1280x1024?
07:46	<Lcarsdata>	1kl
07:46	<andi5>	Crav: you might be able to copy your whole profile directory
07:46	<antidrugue>	frank: "man vnc"
07:46	<Kazol>	taggie: thx, I was afraid 500Mhz is too slow.
07:46	<J^zon>	Help. I need assistance in setting up a home network between a desktop on ubuntu and a laptop on windows...
07:46	<delire>	nameless`: i don't know anything about VNC. i'm really a Linux only guy.
07:46	<nameless`>	FRanKo edit the xvnc config file
07:46	<ffm>	does folding@home negitably affect machine performance?
07:46	<larson999>	i share the same thunderbird dir for windows and linux.  was just a matter of telling windows which profile to use.
07:46	<igge>	surviver: but it doesn't get mounted through fstab... it gets mounted by some newer mechanism which I'm not sure how it works
07:46	<surviver>	igge, u can open fstab with root edit the usb drive set it to ro and done
07:46	<delire>	nameless`: a little OS X (though regretfully)
07:46	<Crav>	andi5: i can't seem to find where thunderbird is saving my mail (in ubuntu)
07:47	<RobbieCrash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
07:47	<nameless`>	delire i'm not even a linux guy <o>	i'm already quite happy everything was running till i wanted a lil more hehe
07:47	<antidrugue>	Frank: the resolution is defined on the server side, so make sure you start your VNC server with the correct resolution
07:47	<debaser>	J^zon: do you have a router? how are you connecting both computers?
07:47	<surviver>	igge, mzz quiet odd cause i've got here my usb drive and i set it in fstab to read only save it and it works ...
07:47	<igge>	surviver: i mean if I insert a usb stick (or camera or whatever) it gets mounted, but not using fstab
07:47	<delire>	nameless`: hehe you glutton!
07:47	<Shaffox>	in what language are the apps in linux here written ? for example xchat or network manager or whatver
07:47	<ffm>	RobbieCrash: Sure your ports are forwarded correctly?
07:47	<J^zon>	I have a router
07:47	<surviver>	igge, mzz oke
07:47	<taggie>	Kazol, if you have speed issues, and are running standard ubuntu, you may want to try xfce instead of gnome. you can install with: sudo apt-get install xubuntu and then you'll be able to switch back and forth between both. xfce tends to be nicer to slow procs.
07:47	<andi5>	Crav: you may need to show hidden files.... it is either in ~/.thunderbird or ~/.mozilla/thunderbird (sorry, i am using evolution)

07:47	<LjL>	Shaffox: in many languages. xchat is written in C. network manager, no idea. Linux is in C. i guess C still dominates, but most of the ubuntu-specific stuff is often written in Python

07:57	<Tarkus>	anyone know how if helix player can read all the media types that VLC can? or if theres similar player to helix that can?
07:57	<debaser>	J^zon: yes
07:57	<kemik>	Stig: sry cannot help you further.. not using ubuntu myself on my laptop/desktops anylonger... but try google if noone here answers
07:57	<debaser>	madman91: ??
07:57	<Stig>	Ok, thanks anyway
07:57	<hoth676>	DVD-ROM q.: I've burned an iso image (made w. mkisofs) on a DVD-R on my Ubuntu-PC. I can read the data on the 'burning" Ubuntu as expected. But when I try to read the same DVD on another Ubuntu (my laptop), it can't. What's the mroblem here? Isn't ISO-fs the standatd for DVDs also? I am a total DVD newbie, beyond "press Play/Stop'. How do you guys burn readable data-DVDs (for backups)?
07:57	<madman91>	debaser: i have to look at group permissions to solve my suspend problem?
07:57	<taggie>	Zenerek, you should get into the bios menu of the FastTrak and setup your raid volume there.
07:57	<debaser>	madman91: yes
07:57	<KrakensDen>	I don't get a splashscreen when I boot up, I just get scrolling text, and the boot doesn't finish automatically
07:57	<KrakensDen>	it prompts me to 'enter a root password for maintenance or press  control-D to continue'
07:57	<antidrugue>	Stig: can you develop your question?
07:57	<KrakensDen>	 pci=ro quiet splash  <- end of my kernel line
07:58	<madman91>	debaser: alrighty.. thanks
07:58	<J^zon>	debaser: ok.. got that
07:58	<tuna>	sound on an iMac 24, does anyone know how to get it?
07:58	<Stig>	 Is there a program or any way to help configure my battery on my laptop? I am new to Ubuntu and have noticed my battery does not last as long as it did on XP. Any idea's why?
07:58	<debaser>	madman91: you must add the second user to the proper group, but I can't tell you which one
07:58	<debaser>	madman91: ur welcome
07:58	<danieltellez_>	hi !!
07:58	<debaser>	J^zon: and the IP is?
07:58	<antidrugue>	Stif: perhaps this can help you: http://technowizah.com/2007/01/debian-how-to-power-management.html
07:58	<Stig>	thanks
07:58	<danieltellez_>	i've got a problem with my feisty distro
07:59	<danieltellez_>	configuring wireless
07:59	<safrus>	i was wondering if it doesn't see the OS because its installed on a SATA drive which is recognized as the 3rd IDE master
07:59	<taggie>	Stig, you can also check System->	preferences ->	power management
07:59	<Zenerek>	taggie: i've got the array setup already, two drives mode stripe
07:59	<KrakensDen>	help anyone?
07:59	<Delco2>	Hi
07:59	<danieltellez_>	i'm using a dlink dwl 122
07:59	<debaser>	KrakensDen: what's your problem?
07:59	<debaser>	Delco2: hi
07:59	<Delco2>	he debaser
07:59	<taggie>	Zenerek, if the OS sees two disks separately, then the raid isn't setup correctly. the card should only be reporting a single target
07:59	<debaser>	Delco2: yep?
07:59	<KrakensDen>	debaser, when I boot up, I get no usplash
07:59	<J^zon>	debaser: do YOU need the IP?
07:59	<ed12>	Should I get Fiesty -- 64bit(AMD) OR 32-bit.. I have an AMD64 pc... Any gotya's.. like less packages on 64-bit...  How much faster is 64 bit?
07:59	<danieltellez_>	and i've tried with wicd, network manager
08:00	<KrakensDen>	bebaser, I do get a prompt for entering my root password for 'maintenance'
08:00	<debaser>	it could help
08:00	<trol0s>	Stig: "gnome-power-manager" seems to be the thing for us?
08:00	<antidrugue>	ed12: i recommend i386, even for a 64bits CPU
08:00	<DShepherd>	Seveas, where can i go to browse feisty-seveas repo?
08:00	<KrakensDen>	debaser, in grub, splash is set to 'on'
08:00	<kiersie>	amd64 doesnt work for me
08:00	<beni>	DShepherd: sed
08:00	<debaser>	KrakensDen: you are booting in recovery mode.
08:00	<Delco2>	debaser: new to Ubuntu. I'm trying to boot live 6.06. it freezes on me.
08:00	<antidrugue>	ed12: some things don't work as well in 64, flash, codecs, etc.
08:00	<DShepherd>	beni, sed?
08:00	<|ringo|>	Delco2: how much ram do you have?
08:01	<debaser>	KrakenDens: try to select the correct entrance
08:01	<rmd_>	Delco2, why are you trying to boot such an old version and how much ram are you working with/
08:01	<KrakensDen>	debaser, the default is 3
08:01	<Crav>	!perl
08:01	<safrus>	can someone please look at my problem here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/5397 and help me get ubuntu to boot up.
08:01	<KrakensDen>	debaser, the third kernel is the generic kernel, not the generic recovery mode kernel
08:01	<sorcerer>	coudl any one tell me iam in edy .. should i upgrade and is it .. unstable or buggy the new ubuntu
08:01	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about perl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
08:01	<Stig>	trol0s: How do I open gnome-power-manager? I press alt+F2 and type it in their, but nothing happeneds.
08:01	<KrakensDen>	debaser, or does it count from zero?
08:01	<Delco2>	why: because its what I have available atm. 256K of memory available.
08:01	<ed12>	antidrugue - thx.. that's what I had thought... But that was a long time ago.. I was thinking things have changed.
08:01	<debaser>	KrakenDens: there should be a message before the password ask
08:01	<Zenerek>	taggie just to see if it was the card or not i used my windows 2000 disk and the floppy with the promise drivers, it saw one single mass not two drives
08:02	<Crav>	how do i run a prgm in perl (in windows, i'm used to C:\perl\bin\perl PRGMNAME)
08:02	<DShepherd>	sorcerer, i am upgraded and it seemed to work fine.. so i would recommend it
08:02	<taggie>	Stig, System->	preferences->	Power settings
08:02	<KrakensDen>	debaser, there isn't
08:02	<debaser>	KrakenDens: it counts beginning from 0
08:02	<antidrugue>	ed12: yes, things are better, but i386 is still less trouble
08:02	<J^zon>	debaser: do YOU need the IP?
08:02	<trol0s>	Stig: I have no idea.. I just saw it in the link you got
08:02	<debaser>	J^zon: you need it.
08:02	<trol0s>	Alt+F2? nice.. learned something new..
08:02	<KrakensDen>	debaser, brb then
08:02	<surviver>	safrus, u controled ur /boot/grub/menu.lst file?
08:02	<Delco2>	rmd_, why: because its what I have available atm. 256K of memory available.
08:02	<ed12>	antidrugue - How much of a speed increase do you get by going to 64 bit...?   any rough estimate?  20% maybe??
08:02	<J^zon>	debaser: I got it.. what next?
08:02	<debaser>	J^zon: go to the other computer and ping the computer you are using by running ping IP
08:03	<kiersie>	less i think
08:03	<safrus>	i posted the menu.lst at that link
08:03	<safrus>	but i didnt control it
08:03	<DShepherd>	Crav, http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/Perl/running.html -- google works
08:03	<taggie>	Zenerek, that's odd. is it possible that you're seeing the correct one (with proper size), and another fake lun that's used for configuration?
08:03	<naknomik>	how do i play a vcd on ubuntu?
08:03	<safrus>	i just let ubuntu install itself
08:03	<antidrugue>	ed12: certainly less than 10%, maybe less, nothing worth the trouble
08:03	<Stig>	taggie, thanks, I have already looked in there but it hasn't got any options to change CPU power, GFX power, etc. I have a 2Ghz dual core processor, and on Windows I was able to use only half of the CPU, which saved alot of battery power.
08:03	<debaser>	J^zon: the other computer is running windows or linux?
08:03	<antidrugue>	ed12: use a custom kernel if you want real speed improvements
08:03	<J^zon>	debaser: the other puter is running windows
08:03	<sorcerer>	DShepherd: i mean is it known to be buggy
08:03	<DShepherd>	sorcerer, i dont think so..
08:03	<debaser>	J^zon: xp?
08:03	<taggie>	stig, there's a gnome widget that lets you choose CPU throttling settings. let me see where it's at...
08:04	<antidrugue>	Stif: yes, you can do that in Linux too
08:04	<J^zon>	debaser: the other puter is running windows XP
08:04	<ed12>	antidrugue - .. d/ling the 32bit fiesty now... thx...
08:04	<antidrugue>	Stig: did you read the tutorial i linked?
08:04	<antidrugue>	ed12: ok cool
08:04	<|ringo|>	Delco2: w/ less than 192MB ram, the livecd doesnt boot, but that obviously isnt your problem.  Have you tried booting into safe graphics mode?
08:04	<Stig>	antidrugue, yes, I'm reading it now thanks :)
08:04	<antidrugue>	Stig: ok
08:04	<surviver>	safrus, mzz looks fine
08:04	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes I have tried safe graph mode.
08:04	<antidrugue>	Stig: there is a part about CPU power management
08:04	<stellaras>	hi there, i have ubuntu 7.04 installed but i can't save,delete etc.. my external usb (i can see and use files but won't let me do anything) also i can see a partition with the name "Filesystem"(In Places->	Computer) which i think that is the partition that ubuntu is installed i want to save files there is it possible? it also don't let me
08:04	<|ringo|>	Delco2: what video card do you have
08:05	<debaser>	J^zon: in the other computer go to Start >	Execute and type cmd
08:05	<DShepherd>	naknomik, what player are you using?
08:05	<Stig>	yeah I just clicked on the tutorial :)
08:05	<debaser>	J^zon: inside the command line type ping IP
08:05	<Delco2>	|ringo|, its an onboard Intel
08:05	<taggie>	Stig; right click on your panel at top, click "at to panel" in the resulting dialog box, find the entry listed "CPU Frequency scaling monitor" it will tell you how the cpu is running, and let you set how you want it used (high power, as needed, low power, etc.)
08:05	<kiersie>	try format it to fat32
08:05	<|ringo|>	Delco2: ok well first select the option to check disk for errors
08:05	<naknomik>	DShepherd:  what do you mean? I just have a regular computer with CD driver.
08:05	<stellaras>	kiersie: was the answer for me?
08:05	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes i've tried that and it freezes.
08:06	<DShepherd>	naknomik, have you tried to play the VCD?
08:06	<J^zon>	debaser: that worked
08:06	<kiersie>	stellaras
08:06	<safrus>	whenever i reboot it straight doesn't detect ubuntu at all
08:06	<|ringo|>	Delco2: if there are no errors, try 6.10 or 7.04 and see if that livecd works.  if not, download the alternate cd which is a text  based installer.
08:06	<trol0s>	antidrugue: do you know why these sort of things aren't integrated in the power management menu already..?
08:06	<debaser>	now type ipconfig in the command line
08:06	<surviver>	safrus, u have installed grub? when u boot u see the grub menu?
08:06	<Stig>	taggie, oh nice! thanks
08:06	<|ringo|>	Delco2: oh well if you try the check disk and it freezes then your burn is messed up
08:06	<safrus>	i dont see grub
08:06	<alrex021>	i try to install the ubuntu 7.04 on my PS3, but it stops on 15% every time. Could anyone pls shed some light my direction.
08:06	<taggie>	Stig; no problem
08:06	<antidrugue>	trol0s: for most people it works out of the box
08:06	<stellaras>	kiersie: but i have all of my works in the external
08:06	<stellaras>	i can't format it
08:06	<grogoreo>	hi
08:06	<Zenerek>	taggie: i'm not sure what you mean but there are no other drives seen only the two seagates, i turned of the primary ide channel that had a fat 32 drive on it, anyway i tried both oem and graphical mode, have not tried text, oh and i'm on dapper here
08:06	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
08:06	<debaser>	J^zon:  it worked by saying repeteadly "64 bytes from..."?
08:07	<|ringo|>	Delco2: You need to do an md5sum on your downloaded iso and see if it matches the md5sum on ubuntu's website. if they dont match, your download failed. if they do match, just reburn the cd and try again
08:07	<Flannel>	alrex021: did you verify the cd?
08:07	<safrus>	i dont see anything when i boot, just a message saying no OS was detected
08:07	<Delco2>	|ringo|... ahhhhh. that may be it. one moment. will try that again.
08:07	<surviver>	safrus, mzz thats quiet a prob cause the grub let u chose what u boot up so u didnt install it or its buggy
08:07	<J^zon>	debaser: repeatedly... four times
08:07	<antidrugue>	trol0s: the things I mentioned here: http://technowizah.com/2007/01/debian-how-to-power-management.html  are really just details
08:07	<debaser>	J^zon: good
08:07	<alrex021>	Flannel: yes I did verify
08:07	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up
08:07	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i would try the supergrubdisk, and manually install grub, and point it at Ubuntu.
08:07	<J^zon>	debaser: next?
08:07	<sam__>	hey
08:07	<grogoreo>	I've just backed up my /var/log folder and doing du -hs on the folder says it's 24M but when I tar it with bz2 it goes down to 5.9M. Is this right? It seems a lot lower than I thought
08:07	<sam__>	anyone know how to chagne the port for the apache server
08:07	<debaser>	J^zon: now do the same but inversely. ping the win computer from the ubuntu computer, with the same command but the correct ip
08:08	<sam__>	i have it set on port 80
08:08	<sam__>	but...
08:08	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
08:08	<sam__>	it aint workin
08:08	<sam__>	i need to set it to port 81
08:08	<debaser>	J^zon: to know the ip of the win computer use 'ipconfig' in the command line
08:08	<kiersie>	Hum ok ntfs is that inside 7.04
08:08	<sam__>	i opened the port on my router firewall
08:08	<safrus>	hmmmm
08:08	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid adapter shouldn't be presenting anything other than the logical volumes you've told it to. the OS shouldn't magically have access to the disks directly. if it does, i don't know what to suggest.
08:08	<alrex021>	Flannel: its asks about some NewWorld partition
08:08	<trol0s>	antidrugue: thanks, the Add To Panel thing taggie mention was something incredible I didn't know so that'll sort it out :)
08:08	<sam__>	but how do i change the apache server so it runs off that port....
08:08	<surviver>	safrus, u remember when u installed u saw in the overview what u was going to install the grub stand in it? normally its easy to see u got then a choice where u want to install grub
08:08	<J^zon>	debaser: ok.. brb
08:08	<xange>	how do I mount my hfs+ external usb drive?
08:09	<IncredibleHink>	Why would my bios not see my hard drive in my hotswap bay?
08:09	<grogoreo>	sam__:  look in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and in your virtual machine file in /etc/apache2/sites-available
08:09	<Jack313>	hey on the beryl how to it says to go system>preferences>sessions to add it to start up?????????????/
08:09	<sam__>	ok in the conf
08:09	<sam__>	wht do i change
08:09	<debaser>	J^zon: what does brb means?
08:09	<Flannel>	sam__: it's in sites-available, theres some ports at the top
08:09	<safrus>	it gives you an option to pick by clicking advanced
08:09	<sam__>	change it to 81
08:09	<kiersie>	hummm....
08:09	<surviver>	debaser, be right back
08:09	<IndyGunFreak>	debaser: be right back.
08:09	<safrus>	first try i didn't touch it
08:09	<sam__>	site avalibe port
08:09	<antidrugue>	trol0s: in some distro the CPU frequency monitor applet is there by default (like in Fedora)
08:09	<Jack313>	How do i get to system>preferences>sessions???????/
08:09	<tatters>	/jon #mythtv-users
08:09	<debaser>	J^zon: anyway, if it worked we're one step closer
08:09	<safrus>	2nd i tried sdb2 and then i got a message saying grub failed to install
08:09	<Flannel>	sam__: also, you'll need to add those ports to ports.conf
08:09	<debaser>	J^zon: are you trying to use samba?
08:09	<Kazol>	Where do I get Konversation themes?
08:10	<taggie>	Stig and trol0s; one thing you should know about that widget on laptops, when i resume from suspend, it seems to lock my cpu into full throttle mode until i restart X, i've reported it as a bug, and i don't know if it happens for other people, just something to watch.
08:10	<antidrugue>	trol0s: but still CPU frequency management is enabled by default in Ubuntu (for most people), it is just the applet that isn't there by default
08:10	<sam__>	where is that??
08:10	<sam__>	ports.conf
08:10	<surviver>	safrus maybe try to install it and try to set the grub at some place else then maybe it works cause ur os is installed only the grub wont work
08:10	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: usually the Live CD, jsut installs Grub, it doesn't give you a choice where to install it.
08:10	<sam__>	where is ports .conf
=== inimesekene_ is now known as inimesekene
08:10	<Flannel>	sam__: in /etc/apache2
08:10	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you booting off two hard drives.
08:10	<Shacker6363>	Hrmm, can anyone in here recommend me a good uTorrent alternative besides Azureus that is Gnome native?
08:10	<debaser>	surviver: thanks
08:10	<J^zon>	debaser: I don't think so.. what is samba?
08:10	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, over here i had i could choce between 2 or 3 palces
08:10	<teethdood>	AmaroK is saying "No MP3 support" what do I do?
08:10	<Woody_>	hi people, what is the command line to get Picasa?
08:10	<sam__>	ports.conf
08:10	<sam__>	which files do i change
08:10	<safrus>	i have 2 hard drives
08:10	<sam__>	again
08:10	<Zenerek>	taggie: so you're saying that the raid card should in fact be seeing a whole mass and not two drives, well in gparted i see to disks, so i guess i'm screwed
08:10	<sam__>	ports.conf
08:10	<debaser>	!samba >	J^zon
08:10	<sam__>	wht else>??
08:10	<Flannel>	sam__: all apache2 config stuff will be in /etc/apache2/conf
08:10	<Stig>	Ah ok, I will watch out for that
08:10	<Flannel>	!enter | sam__
08:10	<ubotu>	sam__: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
08:10	<kiersie>	when i install ubuntu 7.04 AMD64 i get an led flickering on the display and no screen

08:11	<antidrugue>	!mp3

08:11	<debaser>	J^zon: are you trying to share files?
08:11	<GionnyBoss>	Shacker6363: deluge is gnome native. Personally, I prefere azureus, but just give deluge a try!
08:11	<KrakensDen>	debaser, thank you, that was definitely a PEBKAC issue
08:11	<safrus>	then other drive is just media storage
08:11	<Flannel>	sam__: ports.conf and then your virtualhost, in sites-available
08:11	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried changing the boot sequence in your bios?
08:11	<antidrugue>	!mp3 >	teethdood
08:11	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. i would like to share files
08:11	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
08:11	<debaser>	KrakensDen: great!
08:11	<safrus>	i checked the boot sequence and it showed my sata drive being first still
08:11	<debaser>	J^zon: do you know now what samba is?
08:11	<sam__>	ok it says listen on port 81
08:11	<sam__>	so ...
08:11	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats not what i meant
08:11	<Kazol>	Konversation is slowing down my whole computer. How can I reduce its resource usage?
08:11	<sam__>	it should now...
08:11	<J^zon>	Debaser: yes.. thank you
08:11	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, try to install with u choice partitions option maybe u can set a partition for grub
08:11	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
08:12	<sam__>	if itype in my ip adress then:91
08:12	<sam__>	:81
08:12	<sam__>	it should work??
08:12	<Shacker6363>	thanks GionnyBoss
08:12	<Flannel>	sam__: please stop using the enter key as punctuation
08:12	<taggie>	Zenerek, the raid card should see both disks, like, when your computer first does power on self test, it should display a message offering to let you configure the promise card. in that menu, you should see both disks and be able to setup a logical volume. once linux boots, you should only see that volume, not the disks behind the volume.
08:12	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: have you tried CHANGING your boot sequence, to boot the other drive first...to see if grub was put on the other drive.
08:12	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up samba in the ubuntu machine?
08:12	<debaser>	J^zon: ur welcome
08:12	<J^zon>	Debaser: no I haven,t
08:12	<Flannel>	sam__: you need to restart apache, `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart` for those changes to go into effect
08:12	<Stig>	taggie, on the CPU frequency monitor. Is it possible to change the CPU power settings? I can only see it tell me what speed it is running at, but can;t see how to change it;s power settings, etc.
08:12	<safrus>	 no i havent
08:12	<Delco2>	|ringo|, still here?
08:12	<safrus>	the other drive is ntfs though
08:12	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: be a good thing to try, i8'm guessing its on the other drive.
08:12	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: it doesn't matter
08:12	<debaser>	J^zon: have you set up the windows machine? (which doesn't need samba)
08:13	<Kazol>	Any ideas on reducing Konversation's resource usage and where to get themes?
08:13	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, he installed the os its on his machine only the grub is wrong placed or configured
08:13	<taggie>	Stig, just click on it, it should have 4 entries: Conservative, Ondemand, Performance, Powersave
08:13	<Stig>	taggie: Also, do you know if I need to have two instances of CPU frequency monitor running if I have a dual core processor?
08:13	<|ringo|>	Delco2: yeah but im laggy
08:13	<delire>	Woody_: i think you have to download and install Picassa
08:13	<Delco2>	k
08:13	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i know that, but if he's booting the second hard drive first.. and grub isn't loading, its probably not there.
08:13	<Delco2>	|ringo|... yup freezed when testing CD. I tested puppy linux and had to use ide=nomda to get it to work. is there an equivelent for xubuntu live CD
08:13	<Woody_>	guys, what is the command line to type in the terminal to get Picasa?
08:13	<IndyGunFreak>	so odds are, its on the other drive.
08:13	<safrus>	how would i tell grub to install on the sata drive if i reinstall again?
08:13	<Woody_>	thanks delire
08:13	<taggie>	Stig, no the freq is the same between cores.
08:13	<delire>	Woody_: eg manually.. the way Windows and OS X users do.
08:13	<J^zon>	debaser: i had set it up previously... when the other computer was running windows
08:13	<infidel>	i'm having trouble upgrading is there a way to boot of the cd and upgrade?
08:13	<craigbass1976>	Ok, I have efax set up with an external modem and it works fine.  How do I receive "voice" faxes.  These might not be any different than voicemails, but the lady I'm setting this up for has win95 and some fax program that accepts such voice faxes.
08:13	<Woody_>	okay
08:13	<|ringo|>	Delco2: hmmm not sure about nomda
08:13	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, jup that can explain it he can also try to reinstall and set choice of grub to hd0
08:14	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: if i were you, i would reboot, and set whatever drive is set to boot second, to boot first, and see what hapens
08:14	<J^zon>	debaser: i am attempting to migrate over
08:14	<|ringo|>	Delco2: sure its not "noDMA"?
08:14	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: again, several ubuntu installs, and i've never been given a choice where to install grub.
08:14	<Stig>	taggie, nothing happeneds when I left click, when I right click I see the normal taskbar options of "preferences, help, about, remove from panel" etc... :O
08:14	<debaser>	J^zon: good. There are several ways to setup samba, the faster is to edit config files.
08:14	<amro>	Middle mouse button won't work, but it worked fine under 6.10
08:14	<debaser>	J^zon: a good decision.
08:14	<infidel>	!upgrade
08:14	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
08:14	<markus_>	on edgy i had to run sox to make my intel hda soundcard capture line-in for watching tv. now with the feisty upgrade things just stopped working. no more sound in tv (btw: my iremote stopped working also)
08:14	<safrus>	when i look at the other drive shouldn't i see grub installed there?
08:14	<Delco2>	|ringo|, yes. but its command line was nodma. probably the same thing
08:14	<surviver>	IndygunFreak, lol strange i've got 2 choices :s
08:14	<taggie>	Stig, no sure why, what kind of laptop/processor?
08:14	<delire>	Woody_: you might want to take a look at f-spot. in many ways it's better than Picassa. sudo apt-get install f-spot
08:14	<J^zon>	debaser: so.. what do i do next?
08:15	<debaser>	J^zon: I can explain you how to configure samba with commandline, or you can look for a manual in internet. What do you prefer?
08:15	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no... listen.. restart your computer, go into your bios, and set your secondary drive, to boot first.... save changes and exit.
08:15	<Woody_>	ah okay delire
08:15	<safrus>	hd0 or hd1?
08:15	<Stig>	Dell inspiron 9400, it's a intel T7200 Core 2 duo 2Ghz CPU I think...
08:15	<Woody_>	thanks delire
08:15	<blanky>	!java
08:15	<ubotu>	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
08:15	<delire>	Woody_: http://f-spot.org/Main_Page
08:15	<craigbass1976>	The other thing I'm wondering is how come I set up dial up on a box and got an ip but no dns assignment?
08:15	<Stig>	taggie: Dell inspiron 9400, it's a intel T7200 Core 2 duo 2Ghz CPU I think...
08:15	<J^zon>	debaser: will the manual be clear?
08:15	<scott_>	hey, can anyone point me to a feisty guide on manually installing the nvidia drivers through nvidia installer? since new beta drivers just came out and i want to try them
08:15	<Delco2>	|ringo|, what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
08:15	<safrus>	indy i have to reinstall regardless cause i fubared the last install
08:15	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: well, i don't see how you did that, but ok, whatever you want to do, but i would see if grub is working first.
08:16	<danieltellez_>	hi!
08:16	<debaser>	J^zon: it will be surely more clear than me, and explained better.
08:16	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: that way if there is a problem, we can address it now before you reinstall.
08:16	<debaser>	*clearer
08:16	<taggie>	Stig, i don't know, it's possible there's no throttling support for the 7200 yet, but i don't know why that would be. what does the display say? 100% all the time?
08:16	<Stig>	It says it is running at 1Ghz in the CPU frequency monitor
08:16	<safrus>	because i told grub to install to sdb2 which isn't a valid location apparantly
08:16	<taggie>	stig, that's odd.
08:16	<Stig>	60%
08:16	<Stig>	50%
08:16	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you using the alternate install cd, or the live CD?
08:16	<J^zon>	debaser: I will try the manual... and ask you if i need help
08:16	<danieltellez_>	i've got a problem trying to connect to a wireless network in feisty
08:16	<quaal>	http://www.shoppalstores.com/ibmmodelm/image//logos/logo3.jpg
08:16	<xange>	I see my USB drive but I can't change filenames? is the because I don't have write permission to it? how do I change that?
08:16	<safrus>	im using the live cd i think, i running off the cd right now
08:16	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, maybe in his grub file there are this # marks in front so they dont show ? possible?
08:16	<debaser>	J^zon: ok
08:17	<debaser>	J^zon: luck
08:17	<ratmtattat>	exit
08:17	<Delco2>	|ringo|, what would I type at boot: to get the equivelent? boot: live noMDA ???
08:17	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: no..
08:17	<Stig>	taggie: When I open an application or something, it goes up to 100% :O
08:17	<kiersie>	kiersie: when i install ubuntu 7.04 AMD64 i get an led flickering on the display and no screen does any to oplossen
08:17	<taggie>	stig, ah, well, then it's definitely throttling. just not giving you control. dunno what to suggest beyond posting a question to the forum.
08:17	<surviver>	IndyGunfreak, oke :)
08:17	<Zenerek>	taggie: i have already setup the array from the fasttrak menu, that'ss why i was asking about only seeing two disks and not a whole mass in gparted,does it matter if ubuntu is installed already or not?
08:17	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: he has grub, its on the other drive, why he's not restarted like i todl him to, i don't know.
08:17	<debaser>	J^zon: brb XD
08:17	<|ringo|>	Delco2: sorry, im lagging.  I dont know what switch to use thats comparable to your other distro
08:17	<Stig>	taggie: when I am idle it's 50%, pretty cool I guess. But I would like it to be 50% all the time when in battery power!
08:17	<kahrytan>	Houston, We have a problem.
08:17	<Delco2>	|ringo|, ok. thanks
08:17	<Woody_>	so f-spot is better than Picasa delire?
08:17	<taggie>	Zenerek, it shouldn't matter if it's installed yet or not. i'm not sure why gparted would see two disks
08:17	<Morget>	I'm getting "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" on booting the desktop CD.  I googled, and a ton of people have been having the same problem, since Ubuntu v6!  Any solution?
08:18	<mrcreativity>	hello
08:18	<safrus>	i'll re-install and then change boot sequence if it doesnt work
08:18	<ardchoille>	Woody_: Are you running Feisty?
08:18	<safrus>	and if that doesnt work i'll boot from cd and come back here :P
08:18	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: lol, ok.. you're going about it ass backwards, but good luck
08:18	<mrcreativity>	can somone help me with my sound card?
08:18	<delire>	Woody_: i've just heard some people that have tried both say it's better with colour correction etc and a few other things. i've only tried f-spot myself.
08:18	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, lol
08:18	<safrus>	last install it straight up said grub failed to install
08:18	<mrcreativity>	i have intel hda audio on my laptop
08:19	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: you're doing something wrong.
08:19	<Stig>	taggie: Oh wait, I just switched to battery power and it's at 50% all the time now. So I guess it automatically changes the CPU settings. I don't know, I will ask on the forums. Thanks for the help anyway.
08:19	<Woody_>	ardchoille: yes sir
08:19	<frojnd>	why is my soudn all weired when I connect headphones ???? plase help? If I have speakers sound is OK, but when swich the cables sound is all weird.. any ideas??
08:19	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, that explains much
08:19	<delire>	mrcreativity: we got it working together. let me guess, you rebooted and it doesn't work?
08:19	<Delco2>	anyone? what command line is needed to run the live cd, totally in RAM and noMDA???  eg. boot: live ram noMDA ???
08:19	<taggie>	Stig; no problem
08:19	<rogue780|laptop>	!usplash
08:19	<ubotu>	To select the usplash artwork you want, use "sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so && sudo update-initramfs -u" - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/USplashCustomizationHowto for adding your custom artwork
08:19	<safrus>	the first install i didnt get the error though
08:19	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i'm starting to think he's a troll.
08:19	<ardchoille>	Woody_: You may already have f-spot. I noticed it was installed with Feisty from the desktop cd.
08:19	<Woody_>	delire: mmm but Google's Picasa i believe is better, it looks better
08:19	<safrus>	i just started experimenting
08:19	<Woody_>	ardchoille: yes, i have it
08:19	<mrcreativity>	delire: actually, no
08:19	<IndyGunFreak>	i'm not wasting wear and tear on my keyboard anymore helping with this, if you won't try suggesetions
08:19	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, hehe :D it said faillure by installing it ... :)...
=== Lcarsdata is now known as roberthl
08:20	<delire>	mrcreativity: ok
08:20	<nagyv>	hello! I have just installed ubuntu feisty (I am used to kubuntu, but would like to give gnome a try), and would like to know if it is possible to set up the maximize icon to maximize only vertically (on middle click) or horizontall (on right click) as it is done in kde
08:20	<safrus>	i'll do what u say first, brb
08:20	<mEck0>	I want to delete a folder on a usb-memory but got the following message: "rm: cannot remove directory ...: Read-only file system". How can I delete it?
08:20	<delire>	Woody_: sure, go with looks ;)
08:20	<mrcreativity>	i installed ubuntu yesterday, someone graciously helped me out.
08:20	<IndyGunFreak>	for cryin out loud... did it have to be that difficult?
08:20	<delire>	Woody_: i have no idea, try both. you can uninstall f-spot easily..
08:20	<mrcreativity>	i wanted to see what kubuntu was like since i was using suse before,
08:20	<Morget>	Feisty desktop seems to be screwed for new installs:  "Target filesystem doesn't have /sbin/init".
08:20	<delire>	mrcreativity: i helped you out with the sound card i think.
08:20	<mrcreativity>	but i decided i didnt like it that much and installed ubuntu again
08:20	<mrcreativity>	no more sound
08:20	<|ringo|>	Delco2: try sticking ide=nodma  or just nodma to the end of your boot parameters
08:20	<Woody_>	okay i will delire
08:20	<visik7>	liferea crash every now and then on feisty
08:20	<hendaus>	somebody help me please!
08:20	<kahrytan>	Can anyone solve this problem. I logged into my admin account. And went to boot firestarter.  All I got originally Metacity theme and blank box. No errors. I forcequit and loged manually in bash to find any errors. None. And It won't even load to the blank window back. I gave up and logged out to User login. Gnome refused to load. All I got was blank orange-brown desktop. Minute, upper left showed greyish white half box.  W
08:20	<kahrytan>	hat is wrong with Gnome?
08:20	<delire>	mrcreativity: try modprobe snd-hda-intel
08:21	<mrcreativity>	delire: and thank you for that.
08:21	<IndyGunFreak>	i'm willing to bet his grub is on his other hard drive,
08:21	<surviver>	IndyGunfreak, question is there a way to open irc in terminal mode ?
08:21	<nagyv>	mEck0: try deleting as sudo or check if write protection is enabled on the usb-stick
08:21	<larson999>	sox?
08:21	<delire>	mrcreativity: 'sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel' in fact
08:21	<delire>	IndyGunFreak: very likely.
08:21	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: depends on what irc client you use.
08:21	<IndyGunFreak>	irssi , i think so.
08:21	<IndyGunFreak>	delire: only thing that makes sense
08:21	<Zenerek>	taggie: what about the when i used lspci, i saw the card listed but it's subsystem was noted as unknown, mean anything to you?
08:21	<visik7>	mrcreativity: ask on alsa they helped me solve my problems with snd_hda_intel
08:21	<surviver>	IndyGunFreak, xchat
08:21	<delire>	mrcreativity: you should have no output from that command.
08:22	<mrcreativity>	delire: yeap, no output
08:22	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i'm not saying no.. but i don't think so..
08:22	<delire>	mrcreativity: try and play something..
08:22	<mrcreativity>	visik7: the guys here are awesome
08:22	<Robbie_Crash>	After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.
08:22	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, how in normall way u need to set this up? ill give it a try :)
08:22	<mrcreativity>	delire: let me try
08:22	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: running X-chat from Terminal?
08:22	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, jup
08:22	<surviver>	indygunfreak, or any other
08:22	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i don't think you can, i think irssi will, but i'm not 100% sure
08:22	<mEck0>	nagyv: I have tried as sudo, and under Permissions (gnome), Folder Access is "create and delete files" under owner, which is me... But all the folders and files on the stick has a locker-icon on them
08:23	<taggie>	zenerek nope, i don't have a ton of experience with promise internal cards, lots of scsi raid cards, and lots of promise externals. i'd expect to see dmesg | grep sd output have only the logical volume shown.
08:23	<visik7>	mrcreativity: yes but here is a general discussion channel about ubuntu on #alsa you got ppl help you on alsa specific problems
08:23	<IndyGunFreak>	!irssi | surviver
08:23	<ubotu>	surviver: irssi is a command line interface !IRC client. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Irssi for help
08:23	<Flannel>	Robbie_Crash: you might want to just verify that sshd is running
08:23	<steve_>	i need to use the live CD to back up data.  is it possible to eject the live CD and insert a blank dvdr to burn, while booted off the liveCD?
08:23	<kahrytan>	Can anyone solve this problem. I logged into my admin account. And went to boot firestarter.  All I got originally Metacity theme and blank box. No errors. I forcequit and loged manually in bash to find any errors. None. And It won't even load to the blank window back. I gave up and logged out to User login. Gnome refused to load. All I got was blank orange-brown desktop. Minute, upper left showed greyish white half box.
08:23	<surviver>	indygunfreak, irssi works i know that ... but i dont know howto start the session
08:23	<frojnd>	I don't understand why when I connect headphones, sound is all weird,  Ican't hear vocals and when I talk to someone trough skype other person hear himself?? obviously is omething wrong with audio settings. Any ideas how to make sound normal???
08:23	<Robbie_Crash>	Flannel, it is
08:23	<sofia>	nerd!
08:23	<Delco2>	stuck trying to boot live xbuntu. 256 M RAM. old cd-rom drive. 32 MB flash HD. any command line parameters for booting from an older CD rom drive?
08:23	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: you got me there, ive not messed with irssi much,
08:23	<sofia>	nerd!
08:24	<surviver>	indygunfreak, :)
08:24	<Morget>	So does the Feisty liveCD not work at all for brand new installs?  It doesn't seem to.
08:24	<debaser>	sofia = troll
08:24	<mrcreativity>	delire: im downloading the codecs now
08:24	<mrcreativity>	ubuntu is awesome
08:24	<delire>	mrcreativity: cool ;)
08:24	<IndyGunFreak>	Delco2: what problem are you having?
08:24	<surviver>	indygunfreak, iam just trying to do some fun stuff :) like using irc on my terminal
08:24	<Flannel>	surviver: start what session?
08:24	<Woody_>	can i get the full skin of Windows Vista to my Ubuntu?
08:24	<mrcreativity>	is there anyway i can configure my touchpad?
08:24	<surviver>	flannel, howto start irc in terminal
08:25	<surviver>	flannel, to open it
08:25	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i understand, i just know nothing about it.. i stay in Gnome. :)
08:25	<Delco2>	Indy, it freezes after at 'loading essential drivers'
08:25	<kbrooks>	I need some help please.
08:25	<frojnd>	I don't understand why when I connect headphones, sound is all weird,  Ican't hear vocals and when I talk to someone trough skype other person hear himself?? obviously is omething wrong with audio settings. Any ideas how to make sound normal???
08:25	<Flannel>	surviver: 'irssi'?  'irc' should also work
08:25	<surviver>	IndyGunfreak , ;)
08:25	<FrankX>	whats the command to kill a process?
08:25	<IndyGunFreak>	Delco2: have you tried the alternate install CD?
08:25	<surviver>	flannel, yes but what command i need to give to open it in terminal?
08:25	<Flannel>	Robbie_Crash: very odd.  Uh... hmm.  Make sure youre connecting on the correct ort?
08:25	<Flannel>	surviver: 'irssi' is the comamnd
08:25	<sharperguy>	how do i check to see if a text file is ascii or unicode?
08:25	<surviver>	Flannel, oke ill try that :)
08:26	<delire>	mrcreativity: there are a few utilities. i've only used the fairly ancient tpconfig though. is it a Synaptics touchpad?
08:26	<Zenerek>	 taggie hold on, i'm not using that computer right now, i'll be back with the results
08:26	<surviver>	brb
08:26	<amro>	Middle mouse button won't work, but it worked fine under 6.10. I've tried different options whlie reconfiguring X but it still won't work :(
08:26	<tavdash>	hey guys, Can someone tell me if I need to follow the Broadcom instructions for Edgy Eft to get wireless working for me on Fiesty?
08:26	<Delco2>	Indy. not yet. I tested puppy linux and had to give the command line ide=noMDA so I was wondering if there is an Ubuntu equivlent
08:26	<Robbie_Crash>	Flannel, connecting on port 22.
08:27	<Robbie_Crash>	Flannel does ubuntu have some kind of firewall built in that would block that unless explicitly told not to?
08:27	<mrcreativity>	delire: yes it is
08:27	<Delco2>	Indy, I'm also on dail-up so working hard to boot this live cd.
08:27	<IndyGunFreak>	Delco2: i see.
08:27	<Flannel>	Robbie_Crash: and is that the port sshd is listening on?
08:27	<lieter>	Flannel, 22
08:27	<Flannel>	Robbie_Crash: no, firewall rules are blank by default
08:27	<Ax4>	Transferred: ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso 697.90 MB in 1 minutes 5 seconds (10,879.6 KB/s)
08:27	<IndyGunFreak>	Delco2: well, i'd probably try the alternate install CD... its text based, but its not hard
08:27	<Ax4>	weeee!
08:27	<Flannel>	lieter: that's not necessarily true
08:27	<delire>	mrcreativity: if you 'apt-cache search touchpad config' you'll see a few options there..
08:27	<Crav>	(first day on linux) how do i install from a tar?
08:28	<lieter>	Flannel, its the standard SSH port ;)
08:28	<Flannel>	Crav: what are you trying to install?
08:28	<IndyGunFreak>	!alternate | Delco2
08:28	<ubotu>	Delco2: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD - See also !Minimal
08:28	<delire>	mrcreativity: perhaps gsynaptics looks ok. 'apt-cache show gsynaptics'
08:28	<joe4444>	anyone have a problem with Firefox crashing?  before this week it only happened a few times, but lately it's been happening almost everyday
08:28	<mrcreativity>	yeah...i see it
08:28	<Delco2>	Indy. thanks.
08:28	<delire>	mrcreativity: actually, maybe 'apt-cache show qsynaptics'
08:28	<bjoern_>	under feisty all 3d applications are slow, even though i have direct rendering enabled. i have an ati x300se graphic card with driver fglrx installed.
08:28	<IndyGunFreak>	Delco2: no prob... my laptop is pretty finicky with the live install, and I have to use the text based, and it always goes fine

08:29	<OhMyGods>	hi, What difference with gdm/kdm/xdm?
08:29	<radar1976>	it is an ATI Radeon card
08:29	<mrcreativity>	delire: how do install it
08:30	<Delco2>	Indy, atm I am just trying to run Xbuntu in RAM. I cant install as all that comp has is a 32MB flash as HD. its a salvaged pc.
08:30	<bjoern_>	delire: what can i do? wait?
08:30	<IndyGunFreak>	OhMyGods: just different desktop GUIs

08:31	<sonicjosh>	any advice?\
08:31	<Delco2>	Indy, am I right in that Xbuntu can be run in RAM. without install. I may be wrong there.
08:31	<radar1976>	oh ok  well I'm having trouble getting a radeon card to work with X
08:32	<IndyGunFreak>	OhMyGods: if gdm is required by Gnome, then its installed and you won't know about it..
08:32	<amro>	Does anyone know what could be wrong with my middle mouse button? It doesn't work but it used to under previous versions of Ubuntu.

08:32	<radar1976>	it worked find with 6.10 but can't get it working in 7.04

08:34	<mrcreativity>	good idea
08:34	<rob-west>	not 7.10
08:34	<IndyGunFreak>	if you're going to do something that complex, you're probably not in the right room to ask for help on t hat.
08:34	<nasso>	CarlFK, never heard of it... will look it up
08:34	<bjoern_>	does anybody else now, how i can enable glu extensions. the glu extensions do not appear in glxinfo
08:34	<OhMyGods>	oh. thank you IndyGunFreak .
08:34	<Flannel>	rob-west: 7.10 isn't scheduled to release for six months, they haven't even had their developer summit for it.  why do you want 7.10?

08:36	<CarlFK>	magnetron: does that persists when I reboot?

08:47	<mrcreativity>	delire: cool
08:47	<delire>	aro: bjoern_ but this is really insane..
08:47	<kahrytan>	I am having issues loading X/Gnome. When I log in, either admin or user, It just hangs before splash screen.  It works when I reboot fresh. But If I log out now,  it hangs when I log back in.
08:47	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: lol, i don't know if i'd call it great, but it works..lol
08:47	<IndyGunFreak>	I admit, i'm a GUI guy
08:48	<talisein>	aro: have you tried the drivers supplied in the repository?
08:48	<surviver>	hehe
08:48	<Flannel>	!mediakeys | ricmik
08:48	<ubotu>	ricmik: Keyboard shortcuts can be set in System ->	Preferences ->	Keyboard Shortcuts (Gnome) or "Input Actions" in KControl (KDE). If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try keytouch - http://keytouch.sourceforge.net
08:48	<delire>	bjoern_: aro perhaps ask in #ubuntu-devel? don't tell them i sent you.. ask if it's a bug.
08:48	<driz>	i haven't had sound since upgrading to feisty...anyone else experience that?
08:48	<aro>	talisein, I use the drivers supplied by the repository and they work fine, I just wanted to see if the new drivers offered anything
08:48	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, i used like 10 years of windows and when u see this its just amazing :o
08:48	<olimilo>	anyone have any idea where i can get the latest version of bcm43xx-fwcutter for amd64? bcm43xx.berlios.de is offline
08:48	<nubbe>	driz, me
08:48	<aro>	talisein, but it doesn't matter, the new drivers don't support xorg 7.2
08:48	<driz>	sup jake
08:48	<nubbe>	I got a new feisty, disabled ac97 in bios, audigy-card looking detected and in use, all channel-volumes on max and no sound, has worked on edgy... any ideas?
08:48	<Artemis3>	delire, don't expect a quick answer. im still waiting for mine made some hours ago
08:48	<lilrayray>	talisein, the --help displays nothing relating to uninstalling
08:48	<arooni>	hey folks!
08:49	<IndyGunFreak>	surviver: i know, i switched a little over a year ago.. from Windows to completely linux, and i'm still trying to upgrade my spyware program...lol
08:49	<ricmik>	is it possible to just install KDE on Ubuntu, or should I reinstall with Kubuntu?
08:49	<bjoern_>	delire: i think, thats a well known bug
08:49	<delire>	aro: so which drivers should bjoern_ use? he's on drivers that support xorg 7.1
08:49	<goodman>	At the login screen, my first keypress in the "username" box is ignored.  Any ideas?
08:49	<Flannel>	ricmik: yeah, get the package 'kubuntu-desktop'
08:49	<IndyGunFreak>	ricmik: its possible.
08:49	<arooni>	my wireless mouse use to work fine in edgy..... but when i upgraded to feisty, i can no longer click menu buttons........
08:49	<Morget>	So is there any way out of this Busybox error "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" on the Feisty desktop CD?  Or do we have to wait until the next release?
08:49	<delire>	bjoern_: craziness..
08:49	<talisein>	aro: Weird. I know that there is some ubuntu unofficial project that puts the latest proprietary drivers into their own repository, google around for it and they might have a patch
08:49	<IndyGunFreak>	sudo apt-get install kde-desktop
08:49	<Drk_Guy>	Hy
08:49	<arooni>	though all the rest of my moues works ok
08:49	<surviver>	Indygunfreak, lol :)
08:49	<ricmik>	ah, thanks.. :)
08:49	<Jaws>	Im looking for opinions if 64bit is ready for use?
08:49	<Drk_Guy>	Hy
08:49	<mrcreativity>	delire: u know that extra panel that comes when u install ubuntu? the one where all the open tasks are shown along with the button to show desktop?
08:49	<ricmik>	but why does kubuntu exist anyway?
08:49	<delire>	bjoern_: perhaps you should look into Envy. i know that's not a popular thing to say around here, but given the Ubuntu Way is currently broken..
08:50	<Flannel>	ricmik: because some people prefer KDE
08:50	<Drk_Guy>	64 bits is a technology that is so new
08:50	<delire>	mrcreativity: i know of it yes.
08:50	<talisein>	lilrayray: okay, i'm going to look at helix's website and see what I can find out
08:50	<Drk_Guy>	I don't recommend it
08:50	<patrick__>	i just deleted my phpmyadmin folderr in /var/www/ what do i do as i cant access it any more
08:50	<Crav>	is there any easy way to migrate mail from thunderbird to evolution?
08:50	<IndyGunFreak>	ricmik: because choice is a beautiful thing
08:50	<lilrayray>	talisein, thanks
08:50	<mrcreativity>	delire: ho do i enable it once its diabled?
08:50	<bjoern_>	delire: envy?
08:50	<arooni>	help!  feisty doesnt register me pressing my mouse button when i click a menu option. (trackpad || mouse)!
08:50	<Jaws>	Drk_Guy, alright thanks
08:50	<Flannel>	Jaws: ready for use, yes.  The only issue you have is with some proprietary stuff not being available for 64bit
08:50	<Drk_Guy>	Hy, how do i install my Z605 printer dirver
08:50	<IndyGunFreak>	ricmik: just think, its not limited to gnome/kde... there's xfce, flux, and i think a couple others
08:50	<digiterata>	Flannel, thanks for the suggestion. I did try to install cvs, but I'm getting an error. Other packages installed fine using apt-get, but not cvs
08:51	<lilrayray>	is it possible to install kde without the abundance of pointless applications?
08:51	<rr72>	hey, my wireless card worked befor i upgraded to feisty. i have been reasesrching and found a little but not much, my chipset is rt2500 and i dl the drivers but my card still doesnt operate fully
08:51	<Drk_Guy>	for nothing Jaws
08:51	<Flannel>	digiterata: what error are you getting?  pastebin it
08:51	<surviver>	flannel, oke :p that  all works fine now my qeustion how do i exit this w3m ... :p
08:51	<TECH_1>	Will (opera) work on (7.04)?
08:51	<delire>	Crav: save the mbox file that thunderbird uses and import it into evolution?
08:51	<IndyGunFreak>	TECH_1: yes..
08:51	<surviver>	flannel, mzz maybe alt + f4
08:51	<Artemis3>	Drk_Guy, not really new, and can't be helped with not free software not providing 64 bit binaries
08:51	<driz>	mine is not an AC97.  it's a 00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc SB450 HDA Audio (rev 01)

08:53	<driz>	try ndiswrapper for sure, though
08:53	<IndyGunFreak>	TECH_1: you could also just open a terminal, and type "sudo apt-get install opera" and see if that works.
08:53	<kahrytan>	I am having issues loading X/Gnome. When I log in, either admin or user, It just hangs before splash screen.  It works when I reboot fresh. But If I log out now,  it hangs when I log back in.

08:53	<Flannel>	lilrayray: yeah.  You just don't install the metapackages.  Depending on what you want
=== roberthl is now known as Lcarsdata
08:54	<leroi_>	 hey guys im using gdesklets and when i have it running and open firefox it takes me to www.%u.com instead of my home page
08:54	<delire>	mrcreativity: hey no worries.. you don't sound daft at all.
08:54	<kevindos>	I run XFCE, but I accedently downloaded Banshee, and it got all loads of gnomecrap with it, I now removed banshee, but how do I remove the rest of the gnomecrap that came with it
08:54	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon
08:54	<bjoern_>	delire: thank you for this link, i will wait some days, they will certainly find that bug
08:54	<Wiseguy>	anyone know the ! command for the resolution link?
08:54	<delire>	mrcreativity: you're doing just fine (following commands, trying things out).
08:54	<lilrayray>	Flannel, how do you disable meta packages?
08:54	<Drk_Guy>	Is it that hard to help me?????
08:54	<mrcreativity>	delire: thanks. i cant find that panel anywhere
08:54	<delire>	bjoern_: good idea.
08:54	<driz>	and there is an app called "ndisgtk" which is a front end to make it easier for you, eric
08:54	<Drk_Guy>	I have the most recent drivers for Linux from the Lexmark site
08:54	<IndyGunFreak>	kevindos: you could have went to banshee in synaptic, and chose "completely remove banshee", it would have removed banshee and its dependencies i bleieve
08:54	<driz>	no, drk, sorry...wasn't talking to you
08:54	<Flannel>	lilrayray: you don't.  You just don't install using them.  instead of installing "kubuntu-desktop" you install just the KDE desktopish stuff
08:54	<delire>	mrcreativity: ask the channel. ask them how to re-enable a hidden gnome panel.
08:54	<Drk_Guy>	Ok driz
08:54	<delire>	i have to head out for a bit.

08:55	<surviver>	flannel, is there maybe a way to open gaim in this cli format?
08:56	<Flake>	Hello, I am really new to ubuntu and am using 7.04. I have installed Scribus from the Add/Remove menu option and it says that it was placed in Applications ->	Graphics but it doesn't show up there or under any of the other menu choices. I have uninstalled and then reinstalled it but it is the same situation. I don't know what is happening and any help would be appreciated. I am using the Gnome desktop.
08:56	<Delco2>	regarding booting xubuntu live CD. anyone know command line parameters for booting all in RAM. no swap.
08:56	<goodman>	mrcreativity, try "gnome-panel"
08:56	<Meshezabeel>	ok, I give up, how do I find the system requirements for ubuntu? on the site it says the live cd requires 256mb of ram, but how about if it is installed on the system?
08:56	<braveheartlion>	Is there a problem with the Iso file for Ubuntu 7.04 64 bit  desktop?
08:56	<Flannel>	surviver: no.  There's "centericq" which is a textmode messenger client
08:56	<Drk_Guy>	Is there a way to install a spool driver form a file, the terminal just doesn't read it
08:56	<TECH_1>	downloading now......just plain opera or is there a version?
08:56	<talisein>	lilrayray: I'm not finding much.. looks like you will have to uninstall by hand
08:56	<IndyGunFreak>	Meshezabeel: there should be installed requirements there to.
08:56	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon guys!!!!!!
08:56	<IndyGunFreak>	at least i think there is.
08:56	<surviver>	flannel, oke :) but i have already irssi that works :)
08:56	<talisein>	lilrayray: It looks like everything installs to a single directory
08:56	<Drk_Guy>	Linux is hard on no**s dude
08:56	<Flannel>	surviver: right.  irssi and centericq are different ;)  centericq is for AIM, ICQ, and stuff.  irssi is for IRC
08:57	<mrcreativity>	it says a panel is already running...let me figure thius thing out
08:57	<tor__>	Got a weird issue. Installed feisty (was using dapper), and now the system won't automount dvds. It will automount CDs, though. Any suggestions?

08:57	<talisein>	lilrayray: err, no, I'm wrong, there's several directories
08:57	<IndyGunFreak>	Flannel: centericq is a IM client for CLI?
08:57	<Flannel>	surviver: hotmail?  What?  hotmail would be a browser

09:00	<Flake>	Hello, I am really new to ubuntu and am using 7.04. I have installed Scribus from the Add/Remove menu option and it says that it was placed in Applications ->	Graphics but it doesn't show up there or under any of the other menu choices. I have uninstalled and then reinstalled it but it is the same situation. I don't know what is happening and any help would be appreciated. I am using the Gnome desktop.
09:00	<braveheartlion>	what's the official name?

09:00	<Flannel>	phlegm: generic
09:00	<talisein>	lilrayray: Is it in /usr/lib/helix-player, or somewhere else? Did you install the one from the repository already?
09:00	<mrcreativity>	i dont see a cube, but the new task switchet looks cool
09:00	<mwe>	leroi_: don't be lame. are you looking for the door?
09:00	<surviver>	flannel, oke i found a way ill try this out :)
09:00	<Drk_Guy>	The dl page for the file tolled me that it was designed for Linux, and tested in Red hat 9.0

09:01	<Lambach>	any now how to change the width of my mouse pads scrolling section ?
09:01	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: "Verify CD" or "Check CD for defects" or something.  Third one down or something like that
09:01	<Delco2>	anyone know what command line parameters I should try? using Xubuntu live CD. freezes at 'loading essential drivers'. got 256K of RAM
09:01	<goodman>	mrcreativity: can you switch desktops?  (like normally?  ie... do you have more than one?)
09:01	<phlegm>	Flannel: Thanks.
09:01	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: have you tested to see if the printer works with ubuntu's native drivers?
09:01	<IndyGunFreak>	baktaah: could you do a searchin synaptic, fo rsay, Gnome, and go through and remove what you don't want
09:01	<Flannel>	Delco2: did you check the CD for defects?
09:01	<mrcreativity>	nope...and thats probably why i cant see cubes right?
09:01	<Drk_Guy>	Nope, it doesn't work
09:01	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: yean. one of those.
09:01	<baktaah>	IndyGunFreak ...... some of the stuff is necesarry for xubuntu to work so no that wont work
09:01	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: have you tried that option?
09:01	<IndyGunFreak>	baktaah: man, sorry.. i have no answer for you.
09:01	<Drk_Guy>	I have a Cd with Windows and Mac drivers
09:01	<lilrayray>	talisein, no, the repo wasnt working, so the installer asked where to install, so i set it to /usr/lib/helix-player
09:02	<thenetduck>	does anyone know howto set up being able to tab though windows?
09:02	<IndyGunFreak>	baktaah: sudo apt-get reinstall xubuntu... :)
09:02	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: I havent no.  Haven't used a CD in a long tim
09:02	<baktaah>	 IndyGunFreak  does that really work :D ?
09:02	<braveheartlion>	Has anyone hin here tried the "verify CD" or "check CD for defects" on the ubuntu 7.04 install CD? When I tried it, my screen blanked out.
09:02	<Delco2>	Flannel. I think it that its not recognising my CD Rom drive when it starts to install
09:02	<goodman>	mrcreativity: i think so.  try right-clicking the desktop icon in the bottom right and add more desktops.  then reenable the cube effect from the "Desktop Effects" settings window
09:02	<IndyGunFreak>	lol
09:02	<talisein>	lilrayray: right, but since it appears that everything goes into 1 directory, I'm wondering where /usr/lib/hxplayer came from
09:02	<Meshezabeel>	wow, so Edgy's system requirements were only 128MB, whereas Feisty is 256MB???
09:02	<papatwilight>	i know i sead this the other day but i' much inpressed with feisty over edgy
09:03	<thenetduck>	does anyone know how to tabb through windows?
09:03	<kowal>	hi
09:03	<concept10>	thenetduck: thats on by default
09:03	<mrcreativity>	woah...i think i just saw it
09:03	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: Did you verify the md5 of the ISO before burning?  Did you burn at 4x?

09:03	<digiterata>	Flannel, I'm off to look for my sources.list - any idea where I should look?
09:03	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: Okay, goto System->Administration->Printing, click on add a new printer. Select the printer that is connected (hopefully it at least sees it). Then when it asks you to select a driver push the Install Driver button
09:03	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: yes, i verified md5sum, and it was a match
09:03	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: no.  That 256 is memory required to install via liveCD (which is up from 192 in edgy), Alt CD still installs on stuff with tiny memories.
09:03	<rob-west>	im using Virtual Machine stuff to try the new Ubuntu
09:03	<thenetduck>	concept10, how do I tab then? and how do I edit the short cuts to tabb?
09:03	<lilrayray>	talisein, I beleive it contains the symbolic link, wait, unless banshee has something to do with it?
09:03	<braveheartlion>	Flannel: I tried burning 4 or 5 x.
09:03	<Flannel>	digiterata: /etc/apt/sources.list
09:03	<Drk_Guy>	I ahve done that already, the file is not recognized
09:04	<concept10>	thenetduck: alt+tab
09:04	<braveheartlion>	4 or 5 times. Sometimes at 4x speed, once at 20x speed or something like that
09:04	<canas>	does anyone installed beryl on ati radeon??
09:04	<goodman>	mrcreativity: ^_^    there's a better compiz-settings manager than the default one... lemme find it...
09:04	<concept10>	thenetduck: thats left alt
09:04	<Delco2>	Flannel. do you know the command line parameters for full RAM install (no swap) and noMDA?
09:04	<Flannel>	braveheartlion: Not four times.  burn at 4x speed.
09:04	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: it says here that it is 256MB ... http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704
09:04	<thenetduck>	oh... right

09:04	<concept10>	thenetduck: does it work?
09:04	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: can you give me a link where you got this driver from?
09:05	<braveheartlion>	I burned 4 or 5 times because every time i did, it was a failure
09:05	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: right.  That's for the liveCD installer.

09:20	<Max__>	hello, does anyone know the md5sum number for Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn? :)
09:20	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: are you still looking for that?  I remember it on the site somewhere
09:20	<ferret_0567>	Just logout of XFCE/GNOME/KDE and then run one of those
09:20	<braveheartlion>	ferret_0567: but first i should make sure that video card is in fact a ATI or NVIDIa, shouldn't i?
09:20	<rainwalker>	what is the command to tarball a directory?
09:20	<AndreasB>	braveheartlion, try the display settings then

09:20	<SlimeyPete>	BlackDesign: that's 32-bit
09:20	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: would like to find it if you know where it is
09:21	<Drk_Gu1>	Max_ that is listed on the Ubuntu dl page
09:21	<Pelo>	braveheartlion,  check your documentation,  mobo booklet,  waranty card,  bill of sale, or you could try and read the bios data when you boot your comp
09:21	<BlackDesign>	thought so... won't download it today... My connection here sucks... it would take 50 hours :p
09:21	<Max__>	ok well i looked but couldnt really find it, i'll look again..
09:21	<safrus>	indygunfreak u there?
09:21	<IndyGunFreak>	yes
09:21	<foo>	Is ubuntu 7.04 ok for production use? It's hardware support appears to have been improved.
09:21	<braveheartlion>	Pelo: the bios data? my eyes are not quick enough to find that info
09:21	<Darwich>	i cant make my beryl work .. i followed a guide ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=265678   #7 ) .. But it still doesnt work .. any body help?
09:21	<ferret_0567>	foo: not sure
09:21	<safrus>	i get grub now, but im getting error 17
09:21	<aro>	Does Linux allow root partitions to be installed on USB drives?
09:21	<Pelo>	braveheartlion,  pause it
09:21	<braveheartlion>	Pelo: how
09:22	<safrus>	if i edit the line from hd1,0 to hd0,0 it boots up fine
09:22	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Gnome-Failsafe didnt work.
09:22	<foo>	IndyGunFreak: Was that to me?
09:22	<ariks>	Flannel: All i see is the package box, summary box, and further information box
09:22	<safrus>	but i have to do this everytime i boot
09:22	<ferret_0567>	I use it on my webserver, not a business website or anything, no PHP/CSS or anything, either
09:22	<IndyGunFreak>	foo: no..sorry
09:22	<apo>	safrus: Change it in /boot/grub/menu.lst
09:22	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: well, is there some other problem ?
09:22	<Pelo>	braveheartlion,  on your keyboard,  about the pageup pagedwn key,  (or near there)  pause/break
09:22	<Pelo>	enter to continue
09:22	<ferret_0567>	It's so simple, you would laugh if you saw it
09:22	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, try the plain xterm session
09:22	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/desktopedition
09:22	<safrus>	i think apo just answered it
09:22	<papatwilight>	safrus edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
09:22	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: requirements are at the bottom
09:23	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: yeah
09:23	<Darwich>	i cant make my beryl work .. i followed a guide ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=265678   #7 ) .. But it still doesnt work .. any body help?
09:23	<safrus>	and papa
09:23	<safrus>	thanks guys
09:23	<apo>	papa: Too late :P
09:23	<apo>	You're welcome
09:23	<strixy>	hell everyone
09:23	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: open a terminal.. type gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
09:23	<papatwilight>	lol
09:23	<IndyGunFreak>	and edit the file with the new locations.
09:23	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: well, sorta... 256 for CD and 2gig disk space for install
09:23	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: You mean like Ctrl-Alt-f1 does?
09:23	<ferret_0567>	Darwich: copy and paste your xorg.conf to pastebin
09:23	<papatwilight>	slow typist
09:23	<strixy>	Is this the proper place to ask for help setting up a server?
09:23	<braveheartlion>	and if i find out that my video card is not ATI or nvidia, then what do we conclude?
09:23	<ferret_0567>	That you don't need the ATI/NVIDIA drivers
09:24	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: yeah, that's for the CD install though, the regular requirements seem to be nowhere to be found
09:24	<Flannel>	ariks: try this one, it's only one step: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/+filebug-advanced
09:24	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, no.
09:24	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i don't know why you'd ahve that much trouble though, doesn't make much sense.
09:24	<Darwich>	what is the command to xorg.conf?
09:24	<Pelo>	strixy,  provided this is an ubuntu server yes,  but there is no warranty that someone will be able to help you at this time
09:24	<wiking>	i have a problem of upgrading to feisty .... with udev package... i'm getting the error of (find: arithmetic overflow while converting +49394 days to a number of seconds)
09:24	<ivoks>	anyone has an idea how to get glchess in 3d? :)
09:24	<strixy>	Theank you Pelo. it is.
09:24	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: the Xubuntu page is a *little* more helpful: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/xubuntu
09:24	<apo>	While we're talking about the menu.lst... I've edited it to include vga=0x0317, for framebuffer support, but when I reboot a second time, it's not there anymore...
09:24	<apo>	Does anybody know what program causes this?
09:24	<strixy>	I'm having trouble getting MySQL to work under Ubuntu 7.04.
09:24	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: it says 128Mb to run from cd, 192 to install
09:24	<osirisx11>	help request: the mute button on my laptop does not light up when muted
09:24	<Flannel>	apo: Where did you add it?
09:24	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, it starts X11 with a terminal
09:24	<safrus>	im sure i was doing something wrong
09:24	<Darwich>	ferret_0567: what is the command to xorg.conf?
09:25	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: I will tell you that whatever the problem also prevents Firestarter from loading completely. I only get Metacity theme and blank window.
09:25	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: maybe.., are you editing menu.lst?
09:25	<apo>	Flannel: One second
09:25	<strixy>	I can connect to MySQL on the command line, but not through the web. I have php-mysql mod installed.
09:25	<safrus>	i just edited now
09:25	<safrus>	before i wasn't because i didnt have access to it from live cd
09:25	<goodman>	(and that's the lite version.... for regular Ubuntu I think you'd need at least 256Mb to run well.. but like others said, you *can* run it on less.... it is just slow)
09:25	<aro>	Does Linux allow root partitions to be installed on USB drives?
09:25	<kkathman>	Darwich,  its at /etc/X11/xorg.conf I believe
09:25	<apo>	kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=UUID=bfcce436-74d6-4169-a9b8-e6ae0d115c96 ro quiet splash
09:25	<apo>	After that.
09:25	<safrus>	i have one other messed up problem
09:25	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: you changed the ones that didn't have the # sign in front of it, right?
09:25	<apo>	And framebuffer *does* work
09:25	<safrus>	yes indy
09:25	<apo>	But only for one boot.
09:25	<nakor>	hello. I have a quick question. How can I tell what version of ubuntu I have installed? Thanks.
09:25	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: what else/
09:25	<safrus>	i have to disconnect and reconnect my mouse every reboot
09:25	<Darwich>	kkathman: permission denied ?
09:25	<kahrytan>	AndreasB I assume you want me to do X11 to narrow it down to Gnome or X?
09:26	<safrus>	its a razer copperhead
09:26	<Flannel>	apo: righ.  You want to add it up at the top, there's some commented lines.  Add it there.  kopt= for one
09:26	<Hattori>	any pureftpd user?
09:26	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: that doesn't make any sense.
09:26	<kkathman>	Darwich,  edit with your favorite editor at root
09:26	<AndreasB>	not exactly
09:26	<qsu>	what is the new version for ubuntu
09:26	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: yeah, but still is talking about running and installing from the live CD, absolutely no mention of the requirments of it just being run on your hard drive
09:26	<CokeNCode>	What proggie would you guys recommend for editing audio files ?
09:26	<AndreasB>	you start X11 with a plain xsession
09:26	<IndyGunFreak>	qsu: 7.04
09:26	<safrus>	on google i see other people have that problem too
09:26	<CokeNCode>	mp3s
09:26	<strixy>	Nakor try System >	About. (and then pull out an orange!)
09:26	<qsu>	afther feisty fawn
09:26	<CokeNCode>	to e specific
09:26	<ariks>	Flannel: on that form i get "There is 1 error." with no description of the error.
09:26	<kkathman>	darich,  ie.e  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     but back up first
09:26	<braveheartlion>	ferret_0567: i meant, if i findou out that my video card is not ATI or nvidia, can i conclude that the problem with "Check CD  for defects" blanking out my computer is not related to my video card?
09:26	<platman>	cokencode: audacity
09:26	<IndyGunFreak>	qsu: gutsy gibbon.. 7.10
09:26	<CokeNCode>	platman, audacity does that ... thanks , didn't even know
09:27	<safrus>	i had the problem intermittently with windows as well though so i dont think its linux specific
09:27	<nakor>	I should mention, I don't have GUI access - it's a headless server.
09:27	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: doesn't sound it.
09:27	<raccoonsounds>	Has anyone found problems with their wireless cards and Ndiswrapper after upgrading to Fiesty Fawn?
09:27	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: if it's really a big deal, you can get ram from newegg for like $20/256Mb (i guess that'd be around $25 canadian)
09:27	<safrus>	its just consistent with linux
09:27	<kkathman>	Darwich,  sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     but back up first
09:27	<ctothej>	this is slightly off-topic, but is there a Z-notation editor available?
09:27	<benbread>	Hey i'm running dist upgrade from edgy to feisty, but using the tool it's failing on downloading file 59, what can i do>
09:27	<safrus>	i'll use my sons computer to try and update the firmware
09:27	<kkathman>	or use your favorite editor
09:27	<eternaljoy>	does anyone know of a newsreader for Ubuntu that is good, and which is also supports SSL?
09:27	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: i have no idea, doesn't make sense.. is it a PS2 mouse, or a USB mouse/
09:27	<aro>	Does Linux allow root partitions to be installed on USB drives?
09:27	<Flannel>	ariks: Nice.  Well, That's a bug in launchpad I guess.  Theyve changed the UI... in the past few days even.  Seem to be infected by web two point oh.   Do you have javascript enabled?  Since, theres been bugs reported... even two minutes ago.
09:27	<safrus>	usb
09:27	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: no idea.
09:28	<Meshezabeel>	goodman: k, thanks, still think it strange that the actual running requirements aren't listed on http://ubuntu.com
09:28	<eternaljoy>	aro, im running Ubunu off a USB drive
09:28	<safrus>	its a gaming mouse, not really standard
09:28	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,   does pan support ssh ?  its a good news aggregator
09:28	<aro>	Thanks eternaljoy
09:28	<safrus>	since it operates at 2000 dpi
09:28	<wiking>	any ideas? :)
09:28	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, whats aggregator mean?
09:28	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: yeah it might do them some good to put that on there
09:28	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: thats probably part of the prob... i've got a cheap best buy brand 2 buttons and wheel mouse.. 12 bucks, works fine.
09:28	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: with all linux, there really aren't 'minimums' per sey.  You just get a sliding scale of responsiveness and stuff.
09:28	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, and no, it doesnt support SSL.
09:28	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  news reader and organizer
09:28	<kahrytan>	andreas: that worked somewhat. No titlebars.  and xterm is in the bottom right. half covered up.
09:28	<nakor>	so I guess my question really is, how can I tell what version of ubuntu is installed from the command line. Thanks.
09:28	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: are you sure you edited your menu correctly, so it will work when you reboot?
09:28	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  ahh ok  didnt know - I use pan
09:29	<safrus>	im gonna reboot now and see
09:29	<Lolita>	Hello anyone tell me how to fix problem with punkbuster on PB enabled servers[ COD2 ]  error
09:29	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, i heard theres a way to get it run SSL, but im not sure
09:29	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: ok, good luck./.
09:29	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, from the xterm you start gnome-session
09:29	<Flannel>	Meshezabeel: well, there are minimums, but the minimum is so astronomically low (and gives you crappy quality) that most people wouldnt have that issue
09:29	<eternaljoy>	kkathman, may I pls PM you for 2secs?
09:29	<leroi_>	when i have gdesklets running and i open firefox it takes me to www.%n.com instead of my home page
09:29	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: actually, that alien -i command needs to be run through sudo
09:29	<safrus>	thanks for help, its appreciated
09:29	<leroi_>	anyone know how to fix that
09:29	<apo>	Flannel: Thanks.
09:29	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, this should give you loads of usefull trace messages
09:29	<kkathman>	eternaljoy,  sure
09:29	<Drk_Gu1>	Ok, i am tring
09:29	<apo>	Should work now... I hope
09:29	<goodman>	Meshezabeel: also, here it is for 6.10: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/minimum-hardware-reqts.html
09:29	<antidrugue>	leroi_: what is your shortcut to firefox?
09:29	<goodman>	dunno where the 7.04 one is though
09:29	<Meshezabeel>	Flannel: yeah I know this is the same with any OS, but still good to see suggested requirements nonetheless
09:29	<antidrugue>	leroi_: is it just "firefox" or "firefox %n" ?
09:30	<leroi_>	i dragged the icon into the gdesklet bar
09:30	<goodman>	(probably not out yet)
09:30	<_StefanS_>	Anyone aware of a thunderbird 2.0 deb for feisty ?
09:30	<antidrugue>	leroi_: right click on it and make sure it is just "firefox"
09:30	<h4wk_>	E: Couldn't find package beryl-ubuntu
09:30	<h4wk_>	:(
09:30	<Meshezabeel>	k, thanks again goodman
09:30	<leroi_>	antidrugue: thanks alot dude that was teh problem
09:31	<sc0tch>	In Feisty, is the linux-386 package JUST the generic kernel without SMP support or is it something else?
09:31	<antidrugue>	leroi_: no problem
09:31	<antidrugue>	h4wk_: do you have the "universe" repository enabled?
09:31	<h4wk>	thought i did
09:31	<Kensey>	I've got Beryl running and having two issues: 1) Terminal Server *really* hates it when I change a setting, so much so that the entire box locks up.  2) Somehow my cube is no longer a cube - when I hit Ctrl-Alt-[arrow]  I just get a flat set of thumbnail icons and the desktop flips.  Any ideas?
09:31	<h4wk>	Ahh
09:31	<antidrugue>	h4wk_: make sure in System->Administration->Software Repositories
09:31	<Flannel>	sc0tch: No.  Its a lot different than generic.  Dont believe it contains any of the optional optomizations (that get detected and used), it's there incase your processor doesn't like those detections
09:31	<talisein>	sc0tch: the kernel is adaptive. If your system supports SMP, it will include SMP support. If not, it will automatically delete the SMP from itself
09:32	<braveheartlion>	will the alternate cd be a quicker install
09:32	<braveheartlion>	?
09:32	<nakor>	Can someone tell me how to determine the installed version of ubuntu from the command line? Thanks.
09:32	<aie>	Hi guys, my headphone only have one side working
09:32	<antidrugue>	braveheartlion: a bit quicker yes
09:32	<Darwich>	Kkathman: What do you mean back up?
09:32	<Darwich>	kkathman : What do you mean back up???????????+
09:32	<Darwich>	kkathman, What now ?
09:32	<pooya>	hello, can one downgrade libc6 to ubuntu's version?
09:32	<Darwich>	kkathman, What now ?
09:33	<Flannel>	!patience | Darwich
09:33	<ubotu>	Darwich: The people here are volunteers, your attitude may determine how fast you are helped.  Not everyone is available all the time, likewise not every answer is available instantly. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
09:33	<antidrugue>	braveheartlion: though you don't have a desktop while it install itself
09:33	<sc0tch>	Thank you Flannel & Talsein.
09:33	<aie>	anybody know how to resolve one side headphone problem?
09:33	<talisein>	nakor: lsb_release -d
09:33	<braveheartlion>	antidrugue: just a bit quicker
09:33	<braveheartlion>	?
09:33	<kkathman>	Darwich,  dont mess with xorg.conf unless you know what you are doing, and back up your current version before making any changes
09:33	<rainwalker>	Can someone recommend what they think would be the best way to back up one's home directory?
09:33	<Adikone>	I have some mounted NTFS partitions and each time I enter them for the first time I am asked for my password...is there a way to avoid the system to ask for my password?
09:33	<d0lph1nK1ng>	anyone know which driver to install for ATI TV Wonder Elite tv tuner card?
09:33	<apo>	Backups are for cowards! :P
09:33	<antidrugue>	braveheartlion: no more then a bit, but it is a more complex installation, with a bit more options
09:34	<defjux_>	hi id like to set up an http server can anyone tell me how to do this?
09:34	<rainwalker>	apo: Aye, but I've borked up waayyy too many things and regretted not being able to go back and fix them
09:34	<defjux_>	or the best way, i should say.
09:34	<Flannel>	!lamp | defjux_
09:34	<ubotu>	defjux_: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
09:34	<defjux_>	ty
09:34	<Darwich>	ferret_0567, are you there ? .. you said i had to open my xorg.conf ?
09:34	<antidrugue>	i personnaly prefer it (the alternate CD), as it is a bit more reliable (specialy compared to the Xubuntu & Kubuntu install)
09:34	<kane77>	defjux_, apache (or lamp...) :)
09:34	<Flannel>	defjux_: that URL.  If you *just* want apache, only do the apache parts (not php/sql)
09:34	<apo>	I always just put comments in there and say what I changed :)
09:34	<leroi_>	anyone of some good desktop eyecandy?
09:34	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Gnome loads fine that way
09:34	<Puppy_>	Ok, this sounds really werid, but I think I got a virus or something in xubuntu.
09:35	<surviver>	leroi_, gdesklets?
09:35	<apo>	leroi_: Beryl? ;)
09:35	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, curious
09:35	<talisein>	Puppy_: what sort of symptoms do you have?
09:35	<sacater>	where should i go to get my keyboard multimedia and hotkeys working
09:35	<antidrugue>	leroi_: you mean something like that? http://antidrugue.dyndns.org/config.linux/screenshots/xfce.etch.beryl.png
09:35	<rainwalker>	sacater: check out KeyTouch
09:35	<Darwich>	ferret_0567, are you there ? .. you said i had to open my xorg.conf ?
09:35	<Adikone>	noone a hint how to mount my NTFS partitions so that I am not asked for my password when I enter them?
09:35	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, probably your session definition is not good
09:35	<tecie1980>	Is it possible to migrate a software RAID5 that's formatted ext3 in which all of the drives are intact to another system? I'd like to upgrade to the latest version of kubuntu but that sometimes requires me to reinstall the OS and I want to make sure I have a recovery plan.
09:35	<kahrytan>	There was some errors in the terminal. Alarm stuff.
09:35	<diseaser>	anyone have any suggestions on increasing beryl performance?
09:35	<tbuss>	need help with audio setup, using sb audigy es; i have sound but not 5.1. Do I need to install alsa and then edit ~/.asoundrc When I ran locate on alsa I got some hits, does this mean it is already installed
09:35	<leroi_>	yeh i have all that stuff
09:36	<sacater>	rainwalker: thanks
09:36	<eternaljoy>	anyone here use Pan?
09:36	<Puppy_>	talisein: Firefox is acting really weird after I clicked on a page that seemed questionable from a security stand-point (ie spam...)

09:36	<surviver>	antidrugue, the link u gave is 3ddesk? right?
09:36	<Darwich>	Can anyone heklp me with beryl ? .. i have a problem with it .. i've followed a guide for it .. but it still doesnt work
09:36	<talisein>	Puppy_: I assume you've tried closing Firefox and restarting it?
09:36	<con-man>	where I can a torrent for the fiesty upgrade?
09:36	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Would gnome reinstall be good?
09:36	<antidrugue>	surviver: yes, it is beryl on xfce

09:38	<talisein>	Puppy_: Try installing epiphany-browser and viewing websites through that to see if its just firefox
09:38	<antidrugue>	leroi_: hum... you can take it off enterely and use something like kiba (or akamaru) instead
09:38	<debaser>	leroi_: anyway you can customize it with the menu at system >	preferences
09:38	<rainwalker>	Benbread: I followed the guide at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy and I've never had any trouble

09:38	<xtknight>	Kensey, lsb_release -a will do it

09:44	<Rtax>	apo: then you can create it. check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Install_Lirc_Edgy
09:44	<kahrytan>	andreasb: /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-session doesnt exist either
09:44	<kahrytan>	andreasb: but gnome.desktop does.
09:44	<rainwalker>	sacater: I'm not sure what you mean, but if you install KeyTouch there are some options for what the keys will do and what they affect (like I have mine set to affect Amarok)
09:44	<kkathman>	drbashir,  using xchat or xchat-gnome ?

I have tried to follow the SoundTroubleshooting guide, with no luck. I've managed to play a sound once, but changing the digital/analog jack check box under sound preferences. Can anyone help me?
09:45	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, that is the same program you ran from the xterm to start gnome?
09:45	<scienceboy>	debaser: do you know how to solve my problem?
09:45	<georges>	antidrugue: it worked sme time before, not that I never had mysql running. I even have a little gallery2 databese in it
09:45	<NickGarvey>	mystread: if it was a pm, you need to be registered
09:46	<talisein>	Puppy_: I don't know how to troubleshoot this one. It may be your internet connection is just bad right now. Maybe firefox and your computer were compromised, but I find the likelyhood rather low if all you did was view a website
09:46	<debaser>	scienceboy: I don't know what your problem is

09:46	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, I am a out of my wits
09:46	<kkathman>	drbashir,  try installing xchat  instead, and then you have some advanced options under the settings menu option that allow you some flexibility
09:46	<scienceboy>	debaser: there you go
09:46	<apo>	Rtax: ir_common seems to do the work... and interfere with lirc
09:46	<delire>	braveheartlionWi: to install the driver for your ATI card on Feisty go to System->Administrator->Restricted Driver Manager and enable it.
09:46	<diseaser>	anyone know how to make beryl animations run smoothly?
09:47	<PriceChild>	!lamp >	BadaR (see pm from ubotu)
09:47	<Rtax>	ok, then the kernel is recognising it and you need to find someone else, I only know lirc
09:47	<Rtax>	sorry
09:47	<debaser>	scienceboy: I had a problem like that, and I'm reinstalling everything, but it's not the same.
09:47	<drbashir>	kkathman: I think i did do apt-get install xchat, but ill try again.

09:47	<scienceboy>	debaser: so what do i do?
09:47	<BadaR>	nax,LAMP is kinda old school :D
09:47	<stinger05>	hi there, how can i see the installable software that comes "built-in" ubuntu feisty fawn within the OS?
09:47	<debaser>	scienceboy: your /boot/grub/menu.lst file is misconfigured
09:47	<delire>	braveheartlionWi: yes
09:47	<scienceboy>	debaser: just reinstall everything/
09:47	<kahrytan>	Andreasb: Got any other ideas?
09:47	<scienceboy>	debaser: oh
09:47	<eternaljoy>	debaser, GNUS is not good
09:47	<antidrugue>	georges: 23 for me
09:47	<scienceboy>	debaser: so how do i fix that?
09:47	<kkathman>	drbashir,  ok, well be sure you are running the right program, I dont think that xchat-gnome has a "settings" option
09:48	<braveheartlionWi>	delire: what i mean to ask is: how will things be/look before I instnall the ATI driver?
09:48	<diseaser>	Frem: well thats the thing.. its not running at a slow framerate per se.. it just jerks about 75% through the animation one time, on ever animation
09:48	<georges>	antidrugue: what exact version do you have?
09:48	<diseaser>	every*
09:48	<talisein>	Gecko: turn your speakers all the way off, unplug the speakers' power supply, plug back into the digital out and turn the speakers back on, set the software to output on digital, and try again. If that doesn't work, repeat but throw in a reboot after you unplug the speakers
09:48	<delire>	stinger05: all the software installed? 'sudo dpkg -l' it's a long list.
09:48	<debaser>	eternaljoy: gnus is one of the best, just not for not-emacs people
09:48	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, not at the moment
09:48	<big_bang14>	how can i install uira? when i try installing it with qmake installed it returns error 2 after a make or make install

09:49	<big_bang14>	w can i install uira? when i try installing it with qmake installed it returns error 2 after a make or make install
09:49	<antidrugue>	geoges: perhaps you could : "sudo aptitude remove --purge mysql-server-5.0", then clear cache "sudo aptitude clean", then reinstall it
09:49	<debaser>	eternaljoy: I know, you know, let's stop this pls
09:49	<scienceboy>	debaser: yeah, for but not for 7.04, for 6.14(or whatever it was)

09:50	<mwe>	georges: apt-file
09:50	<scienceboy>	debaser: i mean 6.10
09:50	<talisein>	Puppy_: you can delete ~/.mozilla/firefox to 'reset' the old account
09:50	<Kensey>	beryl works better when it's actually *running*!

09:50	<debaser>	eternaljoy: opera
09:50	<delire>	sacater: i use rexima for volume and mic control.
09:50	<eternaljoy>	debaser, any others?
09:50	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: is there a problem with 64 bit ubuntu?
09:50	<Kensey>	newsreader as in USENET?
09:50	<vox754>	braveheartlionWi, so do most of us, but not all applications work correctly in 64 bit environment, not all packages have been ported
09:50	<PriceChild>	sacater, what's wrong with alsamixer?
09:50	<debaser>	eternaljoy: or the one from KDE
09:51	<sacater>	delire: im trying to configure my keyboard, but xfce-keyboard-settings only lets me assign one command to a hotkey, so i need a once control
09:51	<antidrugue>	georges: "dpkg -x ..." to extract
09:51	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok
09:51	<eternaljoy>	debaser, Opera doesnt support SSL for news
09:51	<eck>	NemesisD: is there a grub error code printed to the screen?
09:51	<Puppy_>	talisein: I'll give it a try. Thanks!
09:51	<sacater>	PriceChild: ^^
09:51	<Rtax>	apo: check ubuntuforums.org and mythtv.org/wiki for a workaround
09:51	<PriceChild>	sacater, ahhh I getcha :)
09:51	<debaser>	eternaljoy: sorry, then I can't help you
09:51	<delire>	sacater: i'm sure there will be a way.
09:51	<Kensey>	USENET newsreader, I actually still really like slrn
09:51	<eternaljoy>	debaser, i know
09:51	<Crav>	fiesty automatically mounts my windows (NTFS) partition, how do i enable writing to this partition?
09:51	<sacater>	Im still trying to set up my multimedia keys
09:51	<eternaljoy>	KennethP, slrn?
09:51	<apo>	Rtax: I'm already reading something
09:51	<maddash>	Crav: ntffs-3g
09:51	<eternaljoy>	!slrn
09:51	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about slrn - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
09:51	<braveheartlionXP>	ubuntu.com says that I can have a faster computing if I use 64 bit ubuntu on my 64 bit computer.
09:51	<Kensey>	slrn = command-line USENET reader
09:51	<georges>	antidrugue: I rather think that the files are not in the package. I could download them from the debian version. it's just message files
09:51	<NemesisD>	eck, lemme check
09:51	<debaser>	scienceboy: we must edit your boot configuration
09:52	<tbuss>	when i run 'speaker-test -c 6 -D surround51' all speakers are good to go. How to get 5.1 sound out of my speakers. Do I need to configure ~/.asoundrc
09:52	<scienceboy>	debaser: how do i do that?
09:52	<eternaljoy>	Kensey, doesnt support SSL
09:52	<vox754>	braveheartlionWi, 64 bit are okay for servers who manage lots of files and need a lot of memory and don't need fancy gui desktops
09:52	<debaser>	scienceboy: you can do that by pressing 'e' when GRUB comes up
09:52	<maddash>	Crav: ntfs-3g*
09:52	<delire>	sacater: i don't know how far you'll get with: hotkeys - A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X
09:52	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok, let me get to that
09:52	<NemesisD>	eck, no it just says starting up... a disk read error occurred; press ctrl alt delete to restart
09:52	<braveheartlionXP>	everyone, I've been told not to use 64 bit desktop ubuntu. can anyone conifrim this advice? (I _DO_ have a 64 bit computer)
09:52	<mystread>	NickGarvey: Sorry for the wait man, here it is: I put them in posts =) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2510242
09:52	<Kensey>	then yeah, Thunderbird mebbe?
09:52	<antidrugue>	georges: let see if they are in it, give me a minute, i'll download and extract the ubuntu package (http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mysql-dfsg-5.0/mysql-server-5.0_5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.3_i386.deb)
09:52	<eck>	NemesisD: then I think the error message is printed by the windows bootloader (which is chainloaded after grub)
09:52	<georges>	mwe: installing...
09:52	<debaser>	scienceboy: wait
09:52	<NemesisD>	eck, i see..
09:53	<braveheartlionXP>	amd athlon 64 processor 3800+ is what i have
09:53	<eck>	NemesisD: I'm not really sure how you would fix it
09:53	<Gecko>	Ok, guys, I need a cluebrick...
09:53	<kkathman>	braveheartlionXP  well you can, but just keep in mind there are thngs that are still challenging - codecs, audio, etc in some cases
09:53	<Gecko>	or possibly a lart
09:53	<sacater>	delire: let me see...
09:53	<NemesisD>	oh dear
09:53	<debaser>	scienceboy: we must know what we must change
09:53	<rainwalker>	so what other ways of backing up a home directory are there besides tarballing it?
09:53	<scienceboy>	debaser: pressing 'e' didn't do anything, but pressing 'esc' did
09:53	<braveheartlionXP>	kkathman: really? i didn't know that
09:53	<antidrugue>	georges: is that the right one?
09:53	<eck>	NemesisD: i'm sure you can find something in the forums
09:53	<debaser>	scienceboy: please repeat me the error (the kernel panic)
09:53	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, you won't see much of a performance increase in 64bit ubuntu unless you do heavy opensshd or a couple of other apps.
09:53	<braveheartlionXP>	so why should anyone want to use 64 bit ubuntu, then?

09:54	<antidrugue>	georges: oh damn...
09:54	<Rtax>	.
09:54	<salaah>	im back with another question

09:54	<Rtax>	.
09:54	<Gecko>	Kensey: I need something more like... mycluebrick.com
09:54	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, firestarter is a firewall?
09:54	<mystread>	NickGarvey: You see the link?
09:54	<mrcreativity>	how can i get my laptop to connect to my wifi network automatically on startup
09:54	<antidrugue>	georges: ok, i have it, i verify...
09:54	<NickGarvey>	mystread: looks like a bad partition
09:54	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, openssh is basically a ssh server... don't worry about it. I suggest 32bit Ubuntu :)
09:54	<kerik>	anybody here with experience on the Canon Pixma IP4000 in Feisty?
09:54	<mrcreativity>	it keeps asking me for a keyring password
09:54	<talisein>	Puppy_: yw
09:54	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, are you loading it automatically?
09:54	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: but doesn't work at all  without xterm. (yes)
09:55	<braveheartlionXP>	PriceChild: I was planning on insntalling 64bit ubuntu on my 64bit computer, which i plan on using for websurfing, gimp, ipod syncing (gtkpod), basic stuff
09:55	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, there are many apps which aren't on 64bit like flash which you'll probably want.
09:55	<eck>	mrcreativity: you need the pam keyring package
09:55	<debaser>	scienceboy: what happened when you pressed esc?
09:55	<scotty>	Is there any easy way to make Firefox open a new tab when you middle click a link in Ubuntu?
09:55	<mrcreativity>	eck: the pam keyring package?
09:55	<tbuss>	to configure 5.1 you need alsa /sound card driver and you need to configure ~/.asoundrc? is this correct
09:55	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: No.  I just know both started acting up at the sametime.
09:55	<debaser>	scotty: use opera
09:55	<braveheartlionXP>	PriceChild: i see. and now I'm very discouraged from using 64 bit ubuntu
09:55	<scotty>	Debaser: No

09:55	<arooni>	can i change the ccommands that get sent to alsamxer when i do the volume up keys on my keyboard?  (i want the front channel to stay muted if it already is)

09:55	<mc44>	scotty: er it does it by default for me
09:55	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, how do you load it in gnome?
09:55	<Kensey>	and still work even after cracking skulls!
09:55	<Crav>	scotty: get the tabbrowser preferences extension, than it'll be in the extension options
09:55	<blazemonger>	how do i use flashplayer in gnewsense
09:55	<eck>	mrcreativity: download libpam-keyring and read this: http://www.hekanetworks.com/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/25/staticId/31/
09:55	<Armageddon00>	scotty: i believe there is an option in firefox for opening new links
09:55	<mrcreativity>	scotty: thats happens by default, use an addon called tab mix plus
09:55	<stinger05>	is there a visual program that comes with feisty fawn to show me the built-in programs ?
09:55	<aubade>	scotty: No, but you should be able to have it so when left-clicking on links outside of firefox they'll always open in a new tab.

09:56	<keithg>	OK fellows, I'm having some trouble here... I have my /home directory on a separate partition, and I've installed Feisty Fawn.  I'm having the problem with permissions and owners when trying to log in.  I've been googling for a solution, but I can't seem to find one.  I had this problem in the past and was able to get help here, so I'm here again.  :)  Any ideas?
09:56	<blazemonger>	i need to get a mac for my audio use
09:56	<Gecko>	Kensey: yup. Well, to tell the story, I accidentally dropped a large thing onto my stereo turning it off... Hence the no sound issue... :P
09:56	<trol0s>	does anyone know how do I disable the touchpad tap-to-click function?
09:56	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: If I reboot. As normal. If I logout, I have to use xterm then load gnome
09:56	<antidrugue>	georges: no problem, the files are in the package

09:56	<manitoba98>	Is there a simple way to type international/accented characters in Ubuntu? On Mac OS X, for instance, I can just do Option+E, E and I'll get an E with a forward accent. I just need a simple way to do this. Any ideas?
09:56	<blazemonger>	PC juust aint cuttin it
09:56	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, info is in the faq in the main Ubuntu domain, although not everybody reads it until they've got problems.  I guess 64 bit CPU are cheap to manufacture nowadays even if you don't use them in 64 environments
09:56	<debaser>	scienceboy: when GRUB comes up you must go to the Ubuntu entrance and press e
09:56	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, try a lower speed
09:56	<braveheartlionXP>	so my question is then: what's the use of someone buying a more expensive 64 bit computer if the performance will be the same?
09:56	<antidrugue>	georges i just verifyed
09:56	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Loads fine when I reboot.
09:56	<georges>	antidrugue: ok, give me your download link
09:56	<scienceboy>	debaser: i got a menu giving many different kernels. i pressed 'e' there
09:56	<blazemonger>	and most open source stuff isnt cutting it either since it either half works or won't compile
09:56	<za>	Has anyone installed a network card for Ubuntu before?

09:56	<scienceboy>	debaser: should i list what is there?

09:56	<blazemonger>	i want sumthin i can just click install
09:56	<SpaceBassLaptop>	anyone using truecrypt?
09:56	<AndreasB>	kahrytan, how is it started?
09:56	<PriceChild>	braveheartlionXP, well it isn't if everything you use is written for 64bit... but its not....
09:56	<fuzzy_logic>	keithg: what errors do you get?
09:57	<blazemonger>	and then have everything be over
09:57	<debaser>	scienceboy: first we must know how it's configured
09:57	<AndreasB>	SpaceBassLaptop, yep
09:57	<tbuss>	can some on help with speaker setup plz
09:57	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: Login with normal Gnome session.
09:57	<eck>	mrcreativity: actually, just use this for your gdm pam file (this is what I am using) after you install libpam-keyring http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17109/
09:57	<scienceboy>	debaser: and how do we figure that out
09:57	<scienceboy>	?
09:57	<za>	join #ubuntu -es
09:57	<eck>	mrcreativity: the gnome keyring password has to be the same as your login password, though
09:57	<mrcreativity>	eck: what exactly does this ting do
09:57	<debaser>	scienceboy: what does the root line say?
09:57	<SpaceBassLaptop>	AndreasB, I'm having probblems with it on ubuntu server
09:57	<AndreasB>	kahrytan,  and it starts automatically with the session?
09:57	<scienceboy>	debaser: (hd0, 0)
09:57	<AndreasB>	SpaceBassLaptop, what problems?
09:57	<braveheartlionXP>	I'm currently on the WinXP computer that I want to instnall ubuntu 7.04 on. I don't want to waste a(nother) CD to burn an ISO to. Is there a way I could somehowe install Ubuntu directly on this computer, without using a CD?

09:58	<Armageddon00>	When i try to burn the Ubuntu ISO with K3b it gives me an unknown error (code 254), does anyone know how to fix this, or if there is a channel for K3b/cdrecord?
09:58	<eck>	mrcreativity: PAM is the system that ubuntu uses for authentication. It does the authentication when you login, when you ssh in, when you unlock the screen, etc.
09:58	<arooni>	can i change the commands that get sent to alsamxer when i do the volume up keys on my sony laptop's keyboard (feisty)?  (i want the front channel to stay muted if it already is)
09:58	<kahrytan>	AndreasB: It doesn't hang. It only hangs when I log back out. and log back in.
09:58	<debaser>	scienceboy: and what does the kernel root option say (in the kernel line)?
09:58	<AndreasB>	kahrytan,  because I think the firewall settings went Bad

09:59	<debaser>	*what's happening
09:59	<kerik>	!printer
09:59	<kahrytan>	Andreas: doesn't Complete Removal do that?
09:59	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, don't worry, I've downloaded 64 bit distros too, and now I know I'm on the safe side with 32 bit.  Supposedly, best distro for 64 bit is Gentoo, where you compile everything, and you still have to set a few programs to run in 32 bit

09:59	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, well, I've tried compiling it too...and that fails
10:00	<NemesisD>	ok guys so these guides are saying boot from xp cd, run recovery console and do fdisk /mbr, but doesn't this make grub go away?
10:00	<SpaceBassLaptop>	AndreasB, which version are you using truecrypt with?
10:00	<debaser>	scienceboy: go to the root line and press 'e'
10:00	<keithg>	fuzzy_logic: http://tinyurl.com/2h9xc4  There it is, and that solution on that page doesn't work.  I tried it out.
10:00	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: yeah, that's what I did... there was no package when I tried
10:00	<tbuss>	how is it possible to configure sb audigy for 5.1? I have installed alsa and ran speaker-test -c 6 -D surround51 Is there anything else I need to do

10:00	<blazemonger>	i want something where i don't have to do alot of reading tech manuals too
10:00	<SpaceBassLaptop>	NemesisD, then grub is not in the MBR...perhaps in its own partition
10:00	<debaser>	scienceboy: there should be a prompt, and you should be able to edit that line.
10:00	<eck>	mystread: yes
10:00	<scienceboy>	debaser: yes, i can
10:00	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, but it compiled for you?
10:00	<antidrugue>	mstevens: so this is a system you upgraded, or a clean installation?
10:01	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, then we strongly recommend the 32 bit version
10:01	<mstevens>	anti: upgrade
10:01	<blazemonger>	something i can connect my synths to and have sequencer record midi/audio data
10:01	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: yes, just couldnt inject itself into the kernel
10:01	<NemesisD>	SpaceBassLaptop, so will fdisk /mbr fix my "a disk read error occurred" error when booting windows but it won't touch GRUB?
10:01	<braveheartlionXP>	is there a way to install Ubuntu from hard drive (as opposed to a CD)?
10:01	<debaser>	scienceboy:  you must change (hd0,0) for the correct one
10:01	<eck>	mystread: by default though all the packages and whatnot that you download will be compiled as 64 bit, however
10:01	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: ok.
10:01	<fuzzy_logic>	hmm i dont know keithg.. sorry
10:01	<antidrugue>	mstevens: does it just not connect, does it give you any error?
10:01	<mstevens>	anti: I got as far as deleting my interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces so networkmanager would take them over
10:01	<scienceboy>	debaser: whats the correct one?
10:01	<SpaceBassLaptop>	benlake, its a real bummer
10:01	<debaser>	scienceboy: you have ubuntu in the first master disk, don't you?
10:01	<salaah>	why doesnt the shutdown buttong show restart and shutdown?
10:01	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: maybe one day, ubuntu64bit will be as good as ubuntu32bit
10:01	<mstevens>	it sees the list of APs, I can enter the key, then it whirls a bit and fails to connect
10:01	<scienceboy>	debaser: what do you mean?
10:02	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: not sure why someone hasn't packaged it
10:02	<kahrytan>	braveheart: that will happen when everyone has 64bit
10:02	<keithg>	fuzzy_logic: OK, thanks. I'll keep googling for a solution.
10:02	<talisein>	omg, suspend works on my computer
10:02	<antidrugue>	mstevens : that's good, did you happen to read my tutorial (http://technowizah.com/2007/02/debian-how-to-managing-networks-with.html) ?
10:02	<benlake>	SpaceBassLaptop: it is a nice program
10:02	<debaser>	scienceboy: how many hard drives do you have?
10:02	<scienceboy>	debaser: 1
10:02	<surviver>	salaah, i had same prob late when i reinstalled  i had them back :d
10:02	<salaah>	so...
10:02	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, it will, it all depends on compilation and using the 64 bit properly
10:02	<fuzzy_logic>	keithg: good luck :)
10:02	<salaah>	i dont want to reinstall
10:02	<h4wk_>	humm

10:03	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok, then you must change the second 0 for 1 and, if that doesn't work, change it for 2
10:03	<ferret_0567>	h4wk_: paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file into pastebin
10:03	<surviver>	salaah, u can do this then with sudo shutdown -h or sudo reboot ... maybe make a link to the buttons ...
10:03	<kahrytan>	andreasB: got any ideas?
10:03	<ferret_0567>	All of it.
10:03	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok, let me try it
10:03	<BadaR>	Anyone can suggest a good installing webserver HOWTO on feisty fawn 7.04? =)
10:03	<salaah>	thats not a solution is it
10:03	<debaser>	scienceboy: go ahead
10:03	<surviver>	salaah, i dont think there is

10:05	<za>	ferret_0567:   what else can I do if that doesn't work
10:05	<h4wk>	ferret will do now :)
10:05	<braveheartlionXP>	hello ppl. I found a way to installl Uubuntu from my WinXp computer wtithout using any CDs. (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows)
10:05	<antidrugue>	mstevens: read my tutorial: http://technowizah.com/2007/02/debian-how-to-managing-networks-with.html
10:05	<braveheartlionXP>	yipee.
10:05	<scienceboy>	debaser: i got 'no such partition'. is there supposed to be a space in between the , and the 2?
10:05	<Armageddon00>	tbuss: No i have not, but I have tried other ISOs, Data Discs, and VCDs and all fail with the same error under k3b, what other apps are available to me for ISO burning?
10:05	<benlake>	BadaR: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/index.html
10:05	<kiersie>	hum has anybody a torrent of the last daily build amd64
10:05	<tbuss>	Armageddon00: try gnome baker
10:05	<OSUmom>	I have installed fiesty onto a Averatec C3500 laptop, everything seems to e working fine, except the USB ports are not recognizing anything(but they are getting power). And I have already disaled legacy USB in the bios. How do I fix this?
10:05	<benlake>	BadaR: look at the networking section
10:05	<debaser>	scienceboy: it doesn't matter
10:05	<antidrugue>	in fact: "sudo adduser your_username netdev" is enough (replace your_username with your actual username)  and reboot
10:06	<braveheartlionXP>	should I use the automatic process (instlux), as found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows? Please advise, experts!
10:06	<georges>	antidrugue: sudo dpkg -i mysql-server-5.0_5.0.24a-9ubuntu2_i386.deb =>	mysql start ok!
10:06	<Armageddon00>	tbuss: Ok, will do.
10:06	<magnetron>	kiersie: why not the release?
10:06	<antidrugue>	georges: wow, nice!
10:06	<vox754>	BadaR, there is plenty of info in the forums, and you won't get a better answer than that
10:06	<mlgx>	Bonsoir !
10:06	<tbuss>	Armageddon00:  I had trouble with others as well, this worked for me
10:06	<kiersie>	because its not working for me
10:06	<debaser>	scienceboy: hmmm
10:06	<georges>	antidrugue maybe my apt cache is corrupt, can't explain it otherwise
10:06	<antidrugue>	fr! >	mlgx
10:06	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok. if i change it to 1, i get "error 17: cannot mount selected partition
10:06	<Armageddon00>	tbuss: Ok, thanks.
10:06	<scienceboy>	debaser: and there is no 2 that can be loaded according to it
10:06	<mlgx>	antidrugue pardon ?
10:07	<NemesisD>	SpaceBassLaptop, uhh it did in fact get rid of grub...
10:07	<antidrugue>	georges: yep, would seem so
10:07	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, I wouldn't use it, I think that method is not stable yet. I haven't tried, though.
10:07	<debaser>	scienceboy: that error means the root in the kernel line is not correct, but since ubuntu manages the partitions with UIDs I don't know how to do it
10:07	<benlake>	BadaR: also, if you are trying to setup a real server, use the server version and there is an option on boot that says install LAMP server
10:07	<magnetron>	kiersie: the release is very similar to the last daily builds. in fact, the daily build from the 15th is the same as the release
10:07	<scienceboy>	debaser: oh ... ok. so what should i do? go to the forums?
10:07	<Drk_Guy>	Hy guys
10:07	<OuZo>	how can i set up subversion? are there any web tutorials? thanks
10:07	<antidrugue>	mlgx: i though you were speeking french here, i just wanted to share with you that there is a french channel: #ubuntu-fr
10:07	<Drk_Guy>	Still, i can't install the driver
10:07	<debaser>	scienceboy: for example my menu.lst kernel line says root=/dev/hda3 and I can easily change that
10:07	<za>	who will help me set up my wireless networking card for ubuntu?
10:07	<kiersie>	then i will wait a few days
10:07	<debaser>	scienceboy: yes, or keep looking for help here
10:08	<Hattori>	how to see all commands performed auto after boot?
10:08	<kahrytan>	How would you go about reinstalling Gnome and GTK+?
10:08	<mstevens>	antidrugue: trying it
10:08	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: what kind of card is it?
10:08	<kiersie>	i try update from release
10:08	<debaser>	scienceboy: but you now know what the problem exactly is
10:08	<antidrugue>	mstevens: ok
10:08	<za>	bcmwl5
10:08	<scienceboy>	debaser: oh, ok ...
10:08	<debaser>	scienceboy: repeat it to me please
10:08	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: mine too =)  edgy or feisty?
10:08	<debaser>	scienceboy: (the kernel panic)
10:08	<mlgx>	antidrugue : right, wrong channel to say "Bonsoir" but I can speak english here, no problem :)
10:08	<za>	edgy
10:08	<scienceboy>	debser: ok, here it is. kernel panic - not syncing: vfs: unable to mount root fs on unknown wn-block(0,0)
10:08	<Drk_Guy>	Guys, who will help me configure the Lexmark driver
10:08	<soundray>	!svn >	OuZo, please read the private message from ubotu
10:08	<scienceboy>	debaser: should i reboot and see what happens?
10:08	<vox754>	OuZo, I think typing "svn help" redirects you to the electronic book
10:08	<braveheartlionXP>	vox754: ok. It seems too, that the instlux latest version for ubuntu is 6.10, and not 7.04. So what about the manual process (netboot), as per https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows?
10:08	<antidrugue>	za: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
10:09	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: OK, you'll need to get the package "bcm43xx-fwcutter" and you need the windows install disk for your card
10:09	<debaser>	scienceboy: you can try it, but nothing should change
10:09	<OuZo>	svn help
10:09	<debaser>	scienceboy: to reboot press 'c' in grub and then type reboot
10:09	<antidrugue>	mlgx: no problem, french is my mother language too
10:09	<kahrytan>	How would you go about reinstalling Gnome and GTK+?
10:09	<mlgx>	lol
10:09	<brenix>	hey does anyone in here use mp3blaster??
10:09	<za>	Is that the driver CD?
10:09	<vox754>	OuZo, in the terminal papi!!!
10:09	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: it's probably loading the bcm43xx driver but you need to run the util to grab the firmware which makes it work
10:09	<soundray>	OuZo: subversion is packaged in main, so you can apt-get it.
10:09	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon guys
10:09	<scienceboy>	debaser: yeah, i get the same message
10:09	<foug>	my gaim tab in the taskbar has stomped blinking when i receive a new IM. I have the feature enabled so it should be working but it isn't, any ideaS?
10:09	<tbuss>	what is the best way to enable 5.1 on a sb audigy 2? I have installed ALSA and I have tested the speakers with speaker-test -c 6 -D surround51. The test produces a sound on all speakers but when I play a file only front two channels work
10:09	<kane77>	brenix, what's that?
10:09	<za>	How do I do that
10:09	<Shafto>	!patience | Drk_Guy
10:10	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: yes, just search the CD for the file "bcmwl5.sys" or "bcmwl5a.sys", that's what you need
10:10	<ubotu>	Drk_Guy: The people here are volunteers, your attitude may determine how fast you are helped.  Not everyone is available all the time, likewise not every answer is available instantly. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
10:10	<FeistyFlamer7>	Hello All! and Blessed Day
10:10	<magnetron>	!patience >	Drk_Guy
10:10	<antidrugue>	tbuss: make sure all relevant channels are enabled in "alsamixer"
10:10	<brenix>	kaneti: it is a text-based/console-based mp3 player
10:10	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: if you google  "bcm43xx" you'll find some info from the driver's author
10:10	<Drk_Guy>	Shafto, you here??? Cool
10:10	<kahrytan>	How would you go about reinstalling Gnome and GTK+? It is a simple question.
10:10	<scienceboy>	debaser: wait, it didn't accept the change. let me try again.
10:10	<debaser>	scienceboy: surely the upgrade process was interrupted, I had the same problem and now I'm backing up and reinstalling everything. But I think your problem has a solution.
10:10	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok
10:10	<tbuss>	antidrugue: I have tried but changes in alsamixer seem to have no effect
10:10	<Shafto>	Drk_Guy: So i guess you finally installed Ubuntu XD
10:10	<soundray>	kahrytan: why would you want to do that? Reinstalling rarely solves problems, unlike in Windows.
10:10	<Drk_Guy>	eah!!!!
10:11	<h4wk>	Hmm
10:11	<antidrugue>	Drk_Guy : System->Administration->Printing
10:11	<mlgx>	Does anyone knows how to change the sound card used (my embedded realtek is currently used although I disabled it in the bios AND did not select it in Gnome sound configurator)  ?
10:11	<magnetron>	!enter
10:11	<ubotu>	Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
10:11	<Drk_Guy>	Feisty is on my Hd
10:11	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: first install the cutter utility with "apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter"
10:11	<wastrel>	hi
10:11	<Drk_Guy>	That doesn't work antidrugue
10:11	<antidrugue>	tbuss: hum... google can help perhaps
10:11	<vox754>	braveheartlionXP, I haven't tried or even read about installing from Windows, I think the normal install is okay, Live CD
10:11	<scienceboy>	debaser: well, its not saving it after i leave that menu (the one with the root, kernel, ect). how do i save that?
10:11	<antidrugue>	Drk_Guy: what is the exact printer model?
10:11	<Drk_Guy>	Lexmark z605
10:11	<zaggynl>	mlgx, http://alsa.opensrc.org/MultipleCards#RE:_How_do_I_select_one_card_or_the_other.3F
10:11	<tbuss>	antidrugue: okay, just wanted to make sure that it wasn't a driver prob or alsa
10:12	<hrytan>	soundray: Because Gnome hangs on login after logging out from previous session. Firestarter hangs unless Gnome is loaded via xterm.

10:13	<Drk_Guy>	I have the driver files, some guy called talisein made me install some "Alien" package trough the terminal
10:13	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: to extract the firmware to get the card to work, run the command "bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware/`uname -r` bcmwl5.sys"  .. get all that?
10:13	<debaser>	scienceboy: you can't change the configuration file using GRUB, you must boot a live cd or the linux installation.
10:13	<soundray>	kahrytan: the first thing to do for a hanging login is to check whether you have disk space. If you do, look at $HOME/.xsession-errors for any messages relating to the hanging.
10:13	<safrus>	hey indy, rebooted fine
10:13	<safrus>	thanks for help
10:13	<mlgx>	zaggynl no matter way it work or not, if doesn't I uninstall my Audigy, no more time to waste

10:13	<safrus>	fixed the mouse problem too, had to flash to latest firmware release

10:13	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: good..
10:13	<kahrytan>	soundray: It's not diskspace
10:13	<Drk_Guy>	It doesn't process the files good
10:13	<zaggynl>	mlgx, I have an Audigy too!

10:14	<debaser>	scienceboy: but you shouldn't waste your time trying to change the config file, you can test the changes with the 'e' method and then, when you're sure it works, edit the config file from ubuntu.
10:14	<mlgx>	so Hope is permitted :)
10:14	<soundray>	kahrytan: feel free to put your .xsession-errors on the pastebin if you want me (us) to have a look

10:15	<Drk_Guy>	Pastebin?????????
10:15	<debaser>	scienceboy: but the problem is not in the root line, is in the kernel line or the kernel itself

10:15	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: did it install, or was there an error
10:15	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: well, it fixes most things in any OS.. Ubuntu included, its just under most versions of Linux, its usually not necessary if you can find the support to fix the problem
10:15	<ytsestef>	n2diy: thanks!!
10:16	<scienceboy>	debaser: what do i change it to?
10:16	<kahrytan>	If no one one tells me how to reinstal gnome and gtk+ then Ill just reload ubuntu all together.
10:16	<mstevens>	antidrugue: not yet...
10:16	<soundray>	kahrytan: that was before I logged on, so I don't know anything about it.
10:16	<debaser>	scienceboy: that's what I don't know, because Ubuntu use UUIDS instead of traditional /dev/hda1, for exampel
10:16	<Kazol>	I have a problem-Koversation is slowing my whole computer down.
10:16	<antidrugue>	mstevens: not yet ?
10:16	<safrus>	this definitely seems the place for support
10:16	<mlgx>	brunoUT >	right click on it
10:16	<soundray>	!reinstall >	kahrytan, read ubotu's pm
10:16	<scienceboy>	debaser: oh ....
10:16	<FireCat>	kahrytan: Why do you want to reload gnome/gtk+?
10:16	<za>	it didn't say error
10:16	<scienceboy>	does anyone know what to change the kernel line to here?
10:16	<KalleDK>	!pastebin
10:16	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
10:16	<brunoUT>	mlgx: and what to i click?
10:16	<IndyGunFreak>	safrus: its a good place to get info.. also check.. http://www.linuxquestions.org    http://www.ubuntuforums.com
10:16	<debaser>	you can see that it says "kernel ... root=UUID=... ..." instead of "kernel ... root=/dev/hda2"
10:16	<Flannel>	Lam_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall
10:16	<soundray>	kahrytan: any reason why you don't want to give me the information I asked for?
10:16	<Drk_Guy>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17111/
10:16	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: OK, does the command "whereis bcm43xx-fwcutter" give any output?
10:16	<chris90>	does anyone have bluetooth successfully working with ubuntu, if so how did you do it? short set instructions please
10:16	<ytsestef>	n2diy: dpkg -f is --field and conflicts with the -i option which is --install!!
10:17	<mstevens>	antidrugue: I'm trying tow ork it out now :)
10:17	<debaser>	scienceboy: it's surely an upgrade process interruption
10:17	<scienceboy>	debaser: yeah, i see that. it is? dangit!!! so how do i fix that then?
10:17	<mlgx>	brunoUT : right click on the upper taskbar and you follow the appropriate link to change its appearence
10:17	<Drk_Guy>	Look at the link
10:17	<talisein>	kahrytan: sudo aptitude reinstall <packagename>	will reinstall a package from the command line
10:17	<soundray>	!bluetooth >	chris90, please read ubotu's private message
10:17	<n2diy>	ytsestef: hmm, check the man page for dpkg.
10:17	<kahrytan>	soundray: ~/gnome-session  file loads gnome-session.
10:17	<SpaceBassLaptop>	is there a commandline way to to upgrade server 6.10 to server 7.04?
10:17	<SpaceBassLaptop>	or do I edit the sources...?
10:17	<Lam_>	Flannel: thanks :)
10:17	<soundray>	kahrytan: what's that?
10:17	<safrus>	bookmarked, thanks
10:17	<debaser>	scienceboy: I don't have a clue, you can keep on asking for help here, look out there in the internet or backup and reinstall, as I'm doing.
10:17	<mlgx>	humm kaffeine is really good at managing DVB-T, I am impressed
10:18	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok ...
10:18	<Drk_Guy>	C'mon
10:18	<ytsestef>	n2diy: yup, found it: there's a --force-depends option! ;)
10:18	<Drk_Guy>	So, is there any solution......
10:18	<scienceboy>	debaser: so i'll get all of my files off. cya!
10:18	<brunoUT>	yesterday someone showed off their desktop in here and their taskbar thing looked really cool....it was like shiny and black
10:18	<brunoUT>	how do i do that?
10:18	<za>	i typed it wrong then fixed it however it says it cannot open input file
10:18	<kahrytan>	soundray:  gnome session config.
10:18	<debaser>	scienceboy: my problem was that after the upgrade the computer appeared turned off, just like you, and then it didn't boot at all
10:18	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: ignore that error, it should have put files into the directory anyways
10:18	<jon_>	i'm arguing with a Promise RAID controller. I got the raw source for the drivers but get some compile errors
10:18	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok
10:18	<chris90>	soundray: thanks
10:18	<Crav>	is there a way to put evolution in the sys tray so that it automatically checks my pop every so often?
10:18	<Dazz>	Good afternoon everyone... anyone around willing to help a ubuntu/linux noob setup nvidia drivers?
10:18	<debaser>	scienceboy: hope I was helpful, and luck
10:18	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: you need to copy the SYS file from the driver CD, or just specify the path to the SYS file
10:18	<mlgx>	brunoUT : any screenshot or example on the web to describe it to us ?
10:18	<Drk_Guy>	I see some files
10:18	<n2diy>	ytsestef: roger, gl
10:18	<soundray>	kahrytan: that's not what I asked for. Go reinstall ubuntu, that's what you want, anyway.
10:18	<KalleDK>	Hey i got some problems with vsftpd.. I want my local user to access /var/www the user has the right rights via shell to read and write, but get permission error by ftp... This is my conf http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17112/
10:19	<brunoUT>	yeah let me find it
10:19	<Armageddon00>	tbuss: Do you know if the option "Dummy Write" is a simulated test write?  I want to try this before I turn another CD into a coaster.
10:19	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: right, and there are 2 .rpm files there
10:19	<Drk_Guy>	But, what do i do with them
10:19	<realcoolguy>	I have a weird question, guessing someone might know.  Where are all these random people coming from that try to connect remotely to my desktop?
10:19	<d0lph1nK1ng>	anyone know which driver to install for ATI TV Wonder Elite tv tuner card?
10:19	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: 'alien -i *.rpm'
10:19	<Drk_Guy>	Let me check
10:19	<antidrugue>	Crav: there should be an applet for that, right click on the pannel and look for it
10:19	<OSUmom>	I have installed fiesty onto a Averatec C3500 laptop, everything seems to e working fine, except the USB ports are not recognizing anything(but they are getting power). And I have already disaled legacy USB in the bios. How do I fix this?
10:19	<debaser>	realcoolguy: it criminals
10:19	<za>	is there anyway I can do that without the CD
10:19	<jeffwheeler>	Is there any way to get the keyboard layout like OS X has, with the option (super) key adding functions like proper Unicode quotes, ellipses, etc., but in the same layout?
10:19	<wastrel>	hi
10:19	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: I'm following along as well, with similar issues
10:19	<Xenguy>	realcoolguy: connecting to what, and by what method?
10:19	<Drk_Guy>	It is working now.......
10:20	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: umm, only if you have a driver disk
10:20	<kahrytan>	soundray:  When I reboot, Gnome doesn't hang. Firestarter hangs.  I use a  normal gnome session. When I log out, and try to log back in using Gnome session, it hangs. No splash screen. If I login with Xterm Session then load gnome-session  from , gnome works fine.
10:20	<FeistyFlamer7>	and i just install fwcutter
10:20	<zaphands>	Hello. Does anyone know how to get rid of the netstat zombie?
10:20	<FeistyFlamer7>	without error
10:20	<Drk_Guy>	It sticks there
10:20	<debaser>	jeffwheeler: you mean changing the layout of some keys?
10:20	<kahrytan>	soundray: and firestarter works fine if loading gnome from within xterm terminal.
10:20	<Drk_Guy>	It just shows off two warnings
10:20	<soundray>	kahrytan: what about $HOME/.xsession-errors ?
10:20	<kahrytan>	soundray: there, you are caught up.
10:20	<Xenguy>	zaphands: ps fauxw |less
10:20	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: OK, try this command: "sudo bcm43xx-fwcutter -w /lib/firmware/`uname -r` /media/cdrom/path/to/bcmwl5.sys"
10:20	<brunoUT>	mlgx: here is the link: http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/5020/screenshot100ql9.png
10:20	<Xenguy>	zaphands: then search for 'Z'
10:20	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: actually, did you run that command as sudo? sorry.
10:20	<realcoolguy>	well I have a remote desktop sharing running... and it gives me the prompt that user verizon 123-23-23-24-something.somewhere wants to connect to me... (many similair to this)
10:21	<brunoUT>	how did that person do that with the taskbar on the bottom?
10:21	<debaser>	jeffwheeler: as far as I know that was done with .Xdefaults
10:21	<Xenguy>	zaphands: then kill the 'parent' process
10:21	<mstevens>	antidrugue: hmm, it doesn't connect anymore the old way, which it certainly used to
10:21	<Drk_Guy>	Yeah
10:21	<kahrytan>	soundray: plenty. Most related to Evolution.
10:21	<antidrugue>	mstevens: the old way? with "iwconfig" ?
10:21	<naknomik>	What is the best app to listen to Internet Radio on ubuntu?
10:21	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: ok. Now 'sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart'
=== NickGarvey is now known as Nick{Away}
10:21	<jeffwheeler>	debaser: on OS X, it is possible to do super-shift-[, and similar to get fancy unicode characters. I'm looking to get the same layout, hopefully without having to manually retype every one of the characters in the set.
10:21	<albert>	hi, i'm using fluxbox on a textbased install. now i want to user the xfce4-session manager, but if i do a sudo aptitude install xfce4-session it wants to install the whole xfce desktop. is there a way of just using the session manager and its dependencies?
10:21	<Drk_Guy>	Wait, it is working
10:21	<mstevens>	antidrugue: with what NM calls "Manual Configuration"
10:21	<mlgx>	brunoUT : I guess it's simply a background image
10:21	<realcoolguy>	naknomik xmms has given me the best results with internet radio...
10:22	<Xenguy>	realcoolguy: I guess that people will try to break into other people's PCs using methods like that
10:22	<brunoUT>	what?
10:22	<help_me>	can anybody help me with partitioning a hard drive for linux?
10:22	<brunoUT>	im talkin about the taskbar
10:22	<brunoUT>	on the very bottom
10:22	<chernobylrpgfree>	za: were you able to find the windows driver for your card on CD or floppy?  You may also be able to download it.
10:22	<mlgx>	brunoUT : me too
10:22	<brunoUT>	how did he do that?
10:22	<kahrytan>	soundray:  And errors related to the fact I am logged in as a user.
10:22	<debaser>	jeffwheeler that's surely not a simple task, but you can look for scripts in google or a manual maybe
10:22	<Enselic__>	From what I understand, rsync only transmits changes to files over the network. I assume this implies that sensitive information e.g. stuff in ~/.ssh won't be transmitted unless for those files that change, e.g. known_hosts?
10:22	<soundray>	kahrytan: in your home directory, do a 'mv .evolution/ evolution-backup' and see if it still hangs on login after that.
10:22	<mlgx>	brunoUT : right click on it >	properties >	appearance, there you can choose to use a background for it
10:22	<Z__>	hey all, is there a utorrent alternative or does it run perfectly under wine??
10:22	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, it has finished
10:22	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: ok. Now 'sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart'
10:22	<debaser>	Z__: azureus
10:23	<Drk_Guy>	Ok, the service has restarted
10:23	<kahrytan>	soundray: I could do one better -- just uninstall the application. It is crappy anyways.
10:23	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: then goto http://localhost:631/admin/ in a web browser and see if the printer is listed
10:23	<Drk_Guy>	What now
10:23	<mlgx>	brunoUT : with a good png image, you can obtain a good rendering of the taskbar :)
10:23	<naknomik>	realcoolguy: Does it have a way to list the radio station directory?
10:23	<Z__>	debaser: yea i forget to mention to exclude anything java
10:23	<jeffwheeler>	debaser: think it'd be a reasonable suggestion to post in the Gutsy suggestions forum? I might go ahead and write some of the ones I use more often for now...
10:23	<kiersie>	does anybody know how i put dependys in .deb files
10:23	<voraistos>	realcoolguy: make sure there is no attempt to bruteforce the access. They could find a key if your password is simple.
10:23	<za>	I have to CD at my house.
10:23	<debaser>	Z__: ktorrent and oper
10:23	<antidrugue>	Z: apparently it runs perfectly in Wine
10:23	<debaser>	*opera
10:23	<zaphands>	Xenguy: Thanks. This was Evolution.
10:23	<brunoUT>	mlgx: there is no properties when i right click....just appearance and there is nothing there to make it look like that
10:23	<mlgx>	brunoUT : or maybe a theme, I don't know evrey of them but I guess there are some very stylish ones
10:23	<soundray>	kahrytan: don't uninstall evolution, you'll run into other problems. And stick to professional language in here, please
10:23	<hector>	why my headphones doesn't workon Ubuntu
10:23	<realcoolguy>	voraistos: yeah, i have to click accept or it's no go
10:23	<antidrugue>	Z: but true ktorrent is very nice
10:23	<Drk_Guy>	It shows the real printer and two false ones
10:23	<Xenguy>	zaphands: yw
10:24	<kahrytan>	soundray: while I do that, consider this error.  Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding "toggle_shaded"
10:24	<help_me>	can someone hlep me with partitioning a hard drive for linux?
10:24	<antidrugue>	Z: or transmission is very lightweight
10:24	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: it says it cannot open input file

10:24	<debaser>	help_me: you must use fdisk command
10:24	<safrus>	ok, another noob question

10:29	<kane77>	how can I set printing to be like it was in dapper, that I set in printer preferences what to be the default printout mode... now the default is Normal, Color, 300DPI...
10:29	<debaser>	aleksanteri: ps ax | grep app
10:29	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: try doing the same thing from System->Administration->Printing
10:29	<soundray>	chij: no, you have to go via edgy.
10:29	<scienceboy>	debaser: how do i mount my linux partition?
10:29	<Rtax>	.
10:29	<soundray>	chij: consider doing a fresh feisty install instead
10:29	<chij>	soundray: ok, thanks
10:29	<busfahrer>	Excuse me, how do you set the 'boot splash' (the progress bar during boot) to the correct refresh rate (and perhaps resolution)?
10:29	<Z__>	is there a n64 emu for linux by anychance?
10:29	<chij>	soundray: why?
10:29	<Drk_Guy>	Ok
10:29	<leroi>	anyone in here have gnome dock installed
10:29	<sphynx>	antidrugue: then I've rebooted, and my wifi was shown like eth1:avahi or something like this
10:29	<chij>	i heard somewhere else that dist-upgrade wasn't recommended, also
10:30	<scienceboy>	Z__: the emulator for windows will probably work under WINE
10:30	<debaser>	scienceboy: what's your root partition?
10:30	<realcoolguy>	Z__ I know there is one for n64 becuase I got it going
10:30	<Rtax>	rtax
10:30	<hector>	i have a built-in camera and microphone on my laptop, can I make them work?
10:30	<Drk_Guy>	It says that the printer is ready
10:30	<aaron>	I found it int the Xorg.0.log file.  Thanks Z_
10:30	<soundray>	chij: because it may save you download time overall
10:30	<debaser>	first check if it's automounted, use mount
10:30	<Z__>	scienceboy: hmmm i really hate running stuff through wine, it makes it look a bit ugly
10:30	<scienceboy>	debaser: not sure what you mean. when i installed 6.10, i had it erase XP
10:30	<Z__>	aaron: np
10:30	<elsni>	delire: nothing happens,no error, no sound. Volume is max
10:30	<Z__>	realcoolguy: mind telling me the name
10:30	<realcoolguy>	Z__ and I took the windows plugins and dropped them right in and worked every bit as good as the windows one did (but the plugins it came with were bad)
=== rdz__ is now known as rdz
10:30	<delire>	elsni: what kind of sound are you trying to play?
10:30	<debaser>	scienceboy: in a console, use the command 'mount'
10:30	<leroi>	anyone in here have gnome dock installed
10:30	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: How do I blacklist ndiswrapper?
10:31	<talisein>	busfahrer: in /boot/grub/menu.lst there is a line with "# defoptions=splash vga=" then a number. Do not remove the # from that line, but change the vga mode to the correct one if you can figure it out
10:31	<debaser>	scienceboy: do you know how to open a console?
10:31	<kiersie>	arooni: try http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/interpreters/libdb4.3-ruby1.9
10:31	<delire>	elsni: what is the output of 'sudo modprobe -l | grep snd_hda_intel'

10:31	<scienceboy>	debaser: yes
10:31	<soundray>	!webcam >	hector
10:31	<antidrugue>	Sphynx: what about: "dmesg | grep ipw2200"
10:31	<scienceboy>	debaser: barley
10:31	<sententia>	!pastebin
10:31	<realcoolguy>	Z__ I'm backing up everything and don't have access to my normal desktop.  However I know there is only 1... and no, it wasn't thru wine.  It was native, but the windows plugins for it made it run much better

10:31	<soundray>	sententia: who are you?
10:31	<talisein>	busfahrer: then you need to use aptitude to reinstall some package that will regenerate the boot image files, such as linux-image
10:31	<scienceboy>	debaser: ok, i typed mount
10:31	<arooni>	kiersie: how do i enable multiverse
10:31	<molnaratt83>	Hi. How can I set my network address on my eth0 adapter? /etc/interfaces hwaddress xxx doesn't work for me, and I don't like running a script every time I start the system. Any idea?
10:31	<scienceboy>	debaser: i got a big list
10:31	<elsni>	delire: internet radio
10:31	<Byron>	help_me: with the installer or after installation of ubuntu?
10:31	<Flannel>	help_me: are you installing? or what?
10:31	<scienceboy>	debaser: waht do i do with it?
10:31	<sphynx>	antidrugue: yes, I've tried this, nothing special
10:31	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: After you get the firmware files, you'll need to edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and add a line that says "ndiswrapper".
10:31	<Seb3DGE>	hello guys... I really f***ed up my machine... need some help :P
10:32	<Z__>	realcoolguy: alright il have a look on google
10:32	<delire>	elsni: don't try that, try a wav file or mp3
10:32	<help_me>	byron: with installer
10:32	<kiersie>	http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/interpreters/eruby
10:32	<sphynx>	antidrugue: it shows that ipw2200 was loaded, some zones were detected
10:32	<talisein>	Drk_Guy: try printing
10:32	<Byron>	help_me: have you got any windows or other operating systems installed?
10:32	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: My bad, the line should read "blacklist ndiswrapper"
10:32	<scienceboy>	debaser: wait, doesn't feistly have a backup thing built in?
10:32	<antidrugue>	sphynx: and iwconfig ?
10:32	<busfahrer>	talisein: did I understand you correctly, the post-install will read the setting from the _commented out_ line?
10:32	<debaser>	scienceboy: check for any entrance like /media/disk
10:32	<kahrytan>	soundray: You go over that error?
10:32	<debaser>	scienceboy: I dunno
10:32	<help_me>	byron: i have windows, but i plan to erase my external and use that
10:32	<sphynx>	antidrugue: iwconfig shows that I am NOT associated with any network
10:32	<talisein>	busfahrer: yes. the debconf looks at the commented lines to build a new config file
10:33	<arooni>	kiersie: didnt work
10:33	<sphynx>	antidrugue: but shows my eth1
10:33	<antidrugue>	sphynx but it does list eth1 as wireless?
10:33	<Z__>	realcoolguy: Mupen64 ring a bell?
10:33	<Byron>	help_me: you have to resize the windows partition if it fills the whole HD
10:33	<delire>	sphynx: perhaps network-manager is getting in the way. wouldn't be the first time.
10:33	<talisein>	busfahrer: if you just went to the bottom of that file to change the uncommented lines, the next time the file is generated when a kernel update is put out will erase your change
10:33	<dannyd>	hi, can somebody tell me how to configure my dell wireless mini-pci lan card on linux ubuntu
10:33	<realcoolguy>	Z__ that's it.  I took plugins from the other windows programs and they worked great
10:33	<help_me>	byron: do i need a program for that?
10:33	<soundray>	kahrytan: I'm not your lackey, so don't treat me like one.
10:33	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobyl: Can i talk to you when i restart?
10:33	<Byron>	help_me: you can do that with gparted or qparted, after that, you can use the empty space to create 1 root partition and 1 swap space (swap is 2 times your memory)..
10:34	<scienceboy>	debaser: nope, nothing like /media. i think i know what to do though
10:34	<Z__>	realcoolguy: so you took plugins from windows based n64 emu, dumped them in for mupen64 and it worked,
10:34	<kahrytan>	soundray: Here's xsession-error file when gnome hangs. (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17113/)
10:34	<sphynx>	antidrugue: yes, it lists eth1 as wifi
10:34	<hajiki>	i upgraded to feisty and now i have very LOW sound, help me plz... how do i fix it?
10:34	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: Sure, just AIM/Y!M to me at "chernobylrpgfree"
10:34	<realcoolguy>	Z__  that's right
10:34	<debaser>	scienceboy: pastebin the result of mount please
10:34	<Seb3DGE>	I installed a triple boot (XP, Vista, Feisty) using Ilya Hevnikov's tutorial... I had to upgrade XP to SP2 and this somehow messed up GRUB.. I had an "Error 15: File not found"... Since I had a backup of menu.lst I copied it back but it didn't work... then I messed up something with fdisk, somehow managed to write a new partition table and now I can't boot anything...
10:34	<scienceboy>	debaser: i think i read something about to mount something
10:34	<Byron>	help_me: you can get gparted on the live distro by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-get install gparted
10:34	<Seb3DGE>	any chances of getting it back to work?
10:34	<scienceboy>	debaser: i'll be back in a minute
10:34	<Z__>	realcoolguy: kk, thx gonna set it up on my box
10:34	<sphynx>	delire: maybe I should try the old wpa_supplicant way?
10:34	<debaser>	scienceboy: ok
10:34	<Drk_Gu1>	Hey
10:34	<Morget>	Hmmm, live CD just asked me for a username and password ...
10:34	<chernobylrpgfree>	hajiki: check in your volume controls, that the option "external amplifier" isn't checked
10:34	<leroi>	i need help installing gnome dock
10:34	<Rtax>	I just noticed same problem as hajiki. The default sound is very low, anyway to change it?
10:35	<help_me>	byron: im running on windows xp
10:35	<Drk_Gu1>	The CUPS system doesn't report any Jobs
10:35	<Byron>	help_me: it's a bit tricky so watch out what you do..
10:35	<hajiki>	ill check it
10:35	<sphynx>	delire: why I can connect to my WPA network with LiveCD and can't - with installed wifi?
10:35	<kahrytan>	soundray: you wanted the xsession-errors so i gave it to you
10:35	<Byron>	help_me: maybe you can resize your partition with partition magic, you can also try just installing ubuntu to your external drive.. good luck, gotta go now, bye
10:35	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: so when you try to print nothing happens?
10:35	<chernobylrpgfree>	hajiki, Rtax : I turned off that option and had to turn down my speakers =)
10:35	<Drk_Gu1>	Nothing

10:36	<crdlb>	Dazz, what video card?
10:36	<Dazz>	nvidia 7800
10:36	<h4wk>	What is the most popular mp3 player for ubuntu (I wouldnt mind a playlist) :P
10:36	<debaser>	Armageddon00: there should be one

10:36	<elsni>	delire: i tried mp3 and ogg, but totem player hangs

10:36	<ferret_0567>	Dazz, do you want to play video games with your computer?
10:36	<Armageddon00>	debaser, ok ... could the fact that it is an IDE drive cause the problem?

10:37	<delire>	sphynx: no idea. try removing network-manager
10:37	<crdlb>	Dazz, if that returns NVIDIA and a version number, it's set up
10:37	<kiersie>	the second on then?
10:37	<h4wk>	!codecs | h4wk
10:37	<talisein>	Drk_Gu1: well. I have bad news for you. linux-printing.org classifies your printer as a paperweight. It doesn't look like you will be able to use that printer in linux. To be sure though, I recommend you go to the ubuntu forums and request support there. It might attract the attention of someone who knows specifically about this printer
10:37	<debaser>	Armageddon00: is it a reader or writer?
10:37	<busfahrer>	talisein: It seems that argument can only change resolution but not refresh rate... any other idea?
10:37	<Seb3DGE>	Hey? Anyone?
10:37	<sphynx>	delire: and then add it again?
10:37	<Drk_Gu1>	Ok
10:37	<ferret_0567>	Dazz, do what crdlb said
10:37	<Armageddon00>	debaser, CD/DVD Read/Writer it does like everything short of 52x and Blu-Ray

10:38	<elsni>	delire: Rhythmbox does not play, too
10:38	<kiersie>	o no thats wrong package to:D
10:38	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: huge problems :P
10:38	<delire>	sphynx: no, just use the normal gnome network-admin tool
10:38	<ferret_0567>	If that returns what he said, you don'
10:38	<delire>	sphynx: (or iwconfig etc)
10:38	<scienceboy>	debaser: nope, didn't find it
10:38	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I installed a triple boot (XP, Vista, Feisty) using Ilya Hevnikov's tutorial... I had to upgrade XP to SP2 and this somehow messed up GRUB..

10:38	<Armageddon00>	debaser, and it worked fine under windows before i migrated to openSuSE, and now I'm trying to burn the ubuntu disks for another try
10:38	<soundray>	kahrytan: no, you posted incomplete information and you lack essential manners.
10:38	<debaser>	Armageddon00: you have a bluray writer?
10:38	<arooni>	help!
10:38	<arooni>	how do i install ruby 1.8.6 ?
10:38	<scienceboy>	debaseR: how do i mount the hard drive?
10:39	<Seb3DGE>	please, tell me there *is* a chance to get everything fixed without reinstalling everything again

10:39	<soundray>	kahrytan: is that the entire .xsession-errors file?
10:39	<sphynx>	delire: Normal gnome network-admin dosen't support WPA encyption
10:39	<debaser>	Armageddon00: then search for a CD/DVD writer support linux database, there should be something
10:39	<kahrytan>	soundray: Yes, it is complete.
10:39	<mstevens>	woo! I'm not sure what I changed, but at least for the moment it's working.
10:40	<Armageddon00>	debaser, ok will do
10:40	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: just after booting... but it doesn't say it anymore, looks like I messed up the partition table while trying to rescue from the LiveCD
10:40	<speedy1276>	Anyone know about configuring WPA with static IP address ?
=== darkram_ is now known as darkram
10:40	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: 1.8.5 comes with ubuntu, you should probably use that, do you need .6?
10:40	<debaser>	scienceboy: mount /dev/hdnx /mount
10:40	<soundray>	kahrytan: how long have you waited at the hanging stage?
10:40	<Seb3DGE>	if I use the liveCD and do sudo gparted I see an empty disk, however I can navigate into it and see all the files in nautilus

10:41	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: after booting which one of the three, Ubuntu, Vista or XP? or before that?
10:41	<arooni>	chernobylrpgfree: yes!  breakpoint() is broken in 1.8.5
10:41	<kahrytan>	soundray: I'll try again and wait bit longer.
10:41	<soundray>	kahrytan: no, that should be enough.

10:41	<scienceboy>	cya
10:41	<debaser>	scienceboy: you should try to mount /dev/hda1 /media/somedirectory
10:41	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: ah.  You'll have to uninstall the ubuntu-supported version and get it yourself.
10:42	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I set it up like the tutorial said, so I had the Vista menu that allowed to boot to ubuntu
10:42	<elsni>	delire: ok thank you
10:42	<delire>	sphynx: you'll have to use another tool for that.
10:42	<arooni>	chernobylrpgfree: bwah ;(
10:42	<delire>	elsni: sorry i can't help. many people are having problems with this card in Feisty.
10:42	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: oh... that's different
10:42	<Seb3DGE>	after I upgraded XP to SP2 I could still boot in XP and Vista, but after choosing Ubuntu I had the error

10:44	<Flannel>	Seb3DGE: if it's getting past the grub menu, then it's not menu.lst, its somethig that the menu.lst calls, like your kernel file
10:44	<snap>	how can i switch back and forth between KDE and gnome?
10:44	<ferret_0567>	For all of you people not using Kubuntu because you think KDE is slow
10:44	<kiersie>	arooni: try http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/interpreters/ruby1.9
10:44	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: Is it an on-board sound, or a card?
10:44	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: can you repeat the error please?
10:44	<Seb3DGE>	is it possible to rescue a partition table that has been overwritten?
10:44	<Flannel>	Journeyman: oh, in samba.  Hah.  Well, there you go ;)  that's what you get for using two lines for your question
10:45	<ferret_0567>	snap: you can install kubuntu-desktop
10:45	<Rtax>	chernobylrpgfree: on board
10:45	<Journeyman>	Flannel: hehe ah yeah, that would be bad to just login with no passowrd :)
10:45	<snap>	ferre: it is installed
10:45	<keeganx>	Where would I go to report a bug about Feisty?
10:45	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: well, it WAS Error 15: File not found, but after I ruined my partition table I can't see anything anymore... no windows, no ubuntu, nada... just a blinking cursor
10:45	<elsni>	delire: thank you very much, i'll try!
10:45	<Flannel>	keeganx: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug
10:45	<ferret_0567>	Well...logout, and then click on options >	Sessions
10:45	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: iwlist is showing eth0 eth1 but no wlan1, is this a problem?
10:45	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: a overwritten partition table means that the disk partitions have changed of distribution (size, number, type, etc), I don't think there's a way
10:45	<keeganx>	Thank you Flannel
10:45	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: urgh... not sure what to say then.
10:45	<Dextorion>	snap: if your running e.g gdm, you can choose what you want to launch when you log in.
10:45	<safrus>	im trying to edit the xorg.conf but its saying i dont have permissions to the file
10:45	<Rtax>	chernobylrpgfree: I have noticed the sound mixer volume seems to sit at about 70% by default
10:46	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: No, that's usual behavior.
10:46	<snap>	i have the gnome kde and xbunto packages loaded
10:46	<zaggynl>	My dvd's suddenly stopped being mounted, what can I do?
10:46	<delire>	elsni: good for you my friend. be a little patient and all will be well. the Ubuntu devs have to work hard to try to get things working on every configuration.
=== darkram__ is now known as darkram
10:46	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: I keep mine at 50% to reduce interference, but it's related to my speakers in my case.
10:46	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: 15 : File not found
10:46	<debaser>	This error is returned if the specified file name cannot be found, but everything else (like the disk/partition info) is OK.
10:46	<snap>	i changed the "login screen" settings but it keeps throwing me back to gnome
10:46	<ferret_0567>	Oh, you may be using kdm

10:46	<Dextorion>	snap: When you start your computer do you get a graphical login? Or a command line login?
10:46	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: Is it possible to see all the partitions in nautilus if there is no partition table? Because I do see them.. not in gnome, but in nautilus they're there
10:46	<ryanpg>	hi, I have a laptop with a pentium 4 (desktop CPU) how do I throttle it down from 2.4ghz to 1.8 ghz?
10:46	<LightHammer>	hello, how can i change the distributor logo from the gnome panel under ubuntu 7.04
10:46	<ferret_0567>	Click on the little menu icon
10:46	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: Feisty or Edgy?
10:46	<FeistyFlamer7>	Feisty of course
10:46	<snap>	Dex its a graphical
10:46	<ferret_0567>	You'll see the sessions menu under there
10:46	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you should check for the kernel images and everything in /boot
10:47	<albert>	is it possible to start the xfce4 session manager without the xfce4 desktop?
10:47	<ferret_0567>	Feisty is excellent!
10:47	<Dextorion>	snap: okay, then you should be able to choose what window manager you want to launch.
10:47	<chernobylrpgfree>	FF7: Gotta ask =)  Feisty has a network manager that did it automagically for me... just check the "roaming mode" option for your card
10:47	<horohe>	how to work my keys fn in ubuntu  ? any peolple help me ?
10:47	<ryanpg>	my cpu reports throttleing works
10:47	<kahrytan>	soundray:  I am back. It didn't show in error log but after couple of minutes. Large greyish box appears in the upper left. Half the box is offscreen
10:47	<Rtax>	chernobylrpgfree: ok, guess, I might need to do same, but it didn't seem to be a problem in edgy, but it is in feisty
10:47	<ferret_0567>	Although, I do have a question about Feisty
10:47	<snap>	no just a box for user name and then password
10:47	<LightHammer>	How can i change the menu-icon from the  gnome panel in Feisty
10:48	<soundray>	kahrytan: oh
10:48	<soundray>	kahrytan: what did you do after that?
10:48	<sam__>	hey guys im back
10:48	<chernobylrpgfree>	Rtax: that's pretty odd.  I wish I had more information for you.
10:48	<ferret_0567>	You must not have the Kubuntu KDM theme installed if your using KDM
10:48	<kahrytan>	soundray: rebooted X.
10:48	<ferret_0567>	For GDM, you changed the settings
10:48	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: I'm not a guru and I don't know what you're talking about, what I know is that a partition is, in linux, a device node in /dev directory. Gnome and KDE abstract that and represent the disks, but I don't think they give access to partition tables, mostly gnome.
10:48	<knoppix_>	hi
10:48	<FeistyFlamer7>	chernobylrpgfree: I may have been messing with my network and card settings way to much, is there a way to reset all those settings, without reinstalling the OS?
10:48	<sam__>	got a question, how do run a program like ventrilo, i downloaded the tar.gz now... i unzipped it, and it has the config file, program file, and everything all in a folder
10:48	<sam__>	wht do i do to run the program??
10:48	<knoppix_>	jemand hier?
10:49	<sam__>	start the server service i guess you could say
10:49	<elsni>	delire: yes, i can imagine. I was just impressed that nearly everything else worked out of the box, even wlan!
10:49	<debaser>	sam__: you must surely compile it
10:49	<soundray>	kahrytan: the problem is most likely not your gnome or gtk installation, but the config settings in your home directory.
10:49	<sam__>	how?
10:49	<Dextorion>	snap: Then i dont know. The default login panel for gdm comes with options for that. I dont know if your running gdm though..  Might be kde's manager peharps. No idea.
10:49	<sam__>	how do i compile it
10:49	<chernobylrpgfree>	FeistyFlamer7: Not to my knowledge.  You could try cleaning out the changes to /etc/network/interfaces, then "sudo ifdown eth0; sudo ifup eth0"
10:49	<safrus>	how do i get root permission to a file to edit it?
10:49	<LightHammer>	can somebody help me with my problem of changing menu icons?
10:49	<Sjimmie>	sam__: type: less INSTALL
10:49	<Seb3DGE>	what I mean is that a partition should be invisible if the partition table is erased... but perhaps it's not, since I can navigate the disk...
10:49	<debaser>	sam__: pastebin the content of the directory please
10:49	<Sjimmie>	or something :)
10:49	<soundray>	kahrytan: I would create a new user and work with that for now, and see if it throws up the same problem.
10:49	<kahrytan>	Soundray: thats error log when it actually hangs. On session when it doesn't (after system restart) I get Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding "toggle_shaded" in addition
10:49	<adaptr>	safrus use sudo
10:49	<debaser>	sam__: if there is such a file
10:49	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: It's a real process.  Google "gnome menu icon".
10:49	<Seb3DGE>	well, I think I don't have much choice other than reinstalling everything again... *sign*
10:49	<delire>	elsni: yes there's a high hit rate with this release. still a few rough edges though. with some help from driver developers we'll get there..
10:50	<LightHammer>	ok
10:50	<sam__>	there is not
10:50	<debaser>	sam__. the common and fast method is ./configure && make and then make install
10:50	<Sjimmie>	README ?
10:50	<sam__>	it is already like unziipped and compiled
10:50	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
10:50	<sam__>	but how do i run the service??
10:50	<soundray>	kahrytan: that's just a warning, it's not likely related to the hanging issue
10:50	<safrus>	sudo what?
10:50	<Sp4cedOut>	Is there any way to get inux-headers-'uname -r' and build-essential from the Edgy live CD, since I don't have an interent connection
10:50	<snap>	hmmmmok well I should be able to change from gnome to kde on the fly .......most other flavor of linux ive tried will doo that
10:50	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: try checking the kernel image is there
10:50	<Sjimmie>	lol sam__ you're funny :)
10:50	<horohe>	how to work my keys fn in ubuntu  ? any peolple help me ?
10:50	<adaptr>	safrus sudo whatever it is you want to do as root
10:50	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: and the init ram disk
10:50	<kahrytan>	soundray: what if new user doesn't fix it?
10:50	<Seb3DGE>	wait, I'll boot the machine with the livecd
10:50	<ryanpg>	is there a specific linux image that enables power management of the P4?
10:50	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
10:50	<sam__>	because it has the files
10:51	<Dextorion>	snap: how do you mean "on the fly"?
10:51	<sam__>	like the conf, ventrilo_srv
10:51	<soundray>	kahrytan: only then would I consider a complete reinstall.
10:51	<sam__>	that is the file i need to run ventilo_srv, but how do i start it or run it
10:51	<LightHammer>	chernobylrpgfree: i don't mean the icons in the menu, i mean the icon from the menu
10:51	<ferret_0567>	This is cool, a screenshot of Pidgin IM (which is Gaim, except they had to change the name), this version has new features: http://www.bomahy.nl/hylke/pidgin-screenshot.png
10:51	<debaser>	chmod +x ventrilo_srv and then ./ventrilo_srv
10:51	<kahrytan>	soundray: I can't use  User settings gui tool. Window doesnt load.
10:51	<ferret_0567>	brb
10:51	<Hattori>	anybody use pure-ftpd here?
10:51	<Sp4cedOut>	Is there any way to get inux-headers-'uname -r' and build-essential from the Edgy live CD, since I don't have an interent connection
10:51	<soundray>	kahrytan: you have to add the new user to the admin group
10:51	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yeah.  You'll have to figure out what image you want for your icon, and make a change to gconf (dont know off the top of my head)
10:51	<kahrytan>	Soundray: I just get Metacity theme and blank box inside.
10:52	<snap>	my memory might not be correct but SuSe i could flip from different x-windows managers w/ reloging
10:52	<Dextorion>	Hattori: I did for a while.
10:52	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: I've done it myself, it took over an hour.
10:52	<Hattori>	Dextorion: do u have a clue on how to change settings?
10:52	<kahrytan>	soundray: And I am logged in as such. Just in case I needed to edit a file.
10:52	<soundray>	kahrytan: I take it back
10:52	<LightHammer>	i would replace the ubuntu logo with the gnome food
10:52	<Hattori>	Dextorion: it boot at startup so i dunno how to change some setting..
10:52	<soundray>	kahrytan: do you have a terminal for entering commands?
10:52	<Cosmo_>	on several games when I start them they are off kilter between my 2 monitors, is there a way I can force them into a window that can be moved betweem the monitors?
10:52	<Hattori>	Dextorion: like changing default umask
10:52	<LightHammer>	can i do thios with the gconf editor?
10:52	<safrus>	im trying to save over  the xorg.conf file
10:52	<Dextorion>	snap: never heard about that. :p sorry
10:52	<defjux_>	how do i restart gnome? i used to be able to go alt-ctrl-backspace to reboot shell.. it doesnt work anymore though
10:52	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: check for the kernel images and then change the boot configuration with 'e'
10:52	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Yes.  I just don't remember what setting to change.
10:52	<sam__>	is there anyway to integrate it??
10:53	<defjux_>	how can i restart my shell?
10:53	<debaser>	(in grub)
10:53	<kahrytan>	soundray: Wouldn't the fact window doesn't load be related to gnome hanging?
10:53	<elsni>	delire: yes, I only dicovered one more issue: wake up does not work after suspend to ram. And going to suspend mode takes very long time. But I dont use this normally, so I dont care.
10:53	<sam__>	is there anyway to make the linux server do taht on start up
10:53	<sam__>	run a program like taht??
10:53	<Dextorion>	Hattori: I know that pure-ftpd have start flags for almost everything. I remembering doing somthing quite uggly to get those settings at boot. heh
10:53	<LightHammer>	ok thanks, another question do you know where i can get a gnome-food icon? a real icon not a picture from it?
10:53	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: could you please tell me what to type in terminal to do so, since I'm a newbie? :P :D
10:53	<Dextorion>	Hattori: like setting them in directly in the start script or something like that.
10:53	<soundray>	kahrytan: probably, but the problem could still be in the config files in your home dir.
10:53	<Hattori>	Dextorion: how? editing the script?
10:54	<Jove``>	sam__: Section 3 of ventrilo_srv.htm tells you quite explicitly how to do it.
10:54	<chernobylrpgfree>	LightHammer: Google Image Search is your friend?  You could check gnome's homepage?  Not sure.
10:54	<kahrytan>	soundray: I am thinking GTK+ because it is the window manager. Whats the command for term?
10:54	<sam__>	ok thanxs
10:54	<sam__>	...
10:54	<elsni>	delire: so thank you again, I must reboot ;-)
10:54	<sam__>	if i were to do teamspeak
10:54	<LightHammer>	hmm ok thanks
10:54	<sam__>	would the principles be the same...
10:54	<Jove``>	Yup
10:54	<soundray>	kahrytan: gtk isn't the window manager. The wm is called metacity
10:54	<Dextorion>	Hattori: yeah.  /etc/init.d/whatever.. or something like that.
10:54	<sam__>	kk thxs
10:54	<Dextorion>	Hattori: not sure mate.
10:54	<starz>	!paste
10:54	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
10:54	<PqSe>	Is it possible to run DRM Encrypted files from Audible.com or iTunes music store within ubuntu?
10:54	<tmbg>	I recently upgraded kubuntu 6.10 to feisty. it broke network connectivity for most websites (even if I resolve elsewhere and plug in IP) and ftp and such, no one in #kubuntu has been able to help so I thought I'd ask here. machine is using nvidia forcedeth driver. please msg me if  you have any ideas, thanks.
10:54	<Hattori>	Dextorion: http://pastebin.ca/453013 is the /etc/init.d/pure-ftpd script
10:54	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you're with a liveCD in the affected computer, aren't you?
10:54	<Hattori>	Dextorion: u know how to add -U switch?
10:55	<kahrytan>	soundray: I thought one controled title bars and other the controls
10:55	<soundray>	kahrytan: run 'sudo adduser kahrytan2 ; sudo adduser kahrytan2 admin'
10:55	<chijjer>	i updated my sources.list file to replace all the 'edgy's with 'feisty', ran 'sudo apt-get update', then ran 'sudo aptitude dist-upgrade' -- but it gave me this error: "No solution found within the allotted time.  Try harder? [Y/n] " -- so i sent 'y', and it did whatever it was doing for a longer period of time, SAME error again. what should i do? i can't keep "trying harder" forever lol
10:55	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: nope, I'm on another machine that's next to the affected one
10:55	<Wiseguy>	does anyone know how to get svideo out working on an ati radeon 9600 card?
10:55	<Seb3DGE>	I have 5 computers here ;)
10:55	<clearzen>	tmbg:  Have you edited your /etc/resolv.conf file?
10:55	<cherva>	ZdRaStI i need a quick help on shell scripting when i echo $USER it gives me the user I'm loged in with but there was a command to echo the time and it is not echo $TIME pls help
10:55	<soundray>	kahrytan: replace kahrytan2 with the name you want the new user to have
10:56	<atlantis>	in fedora there is a package that adds a lot of tab completions, like for different services, likes 'ssh <tab>' would look though /etc/hosts... does anyone know if there is a package that adds that functionality for ubuntu?
10:56	<soundray>	cherva: just 'date'
10:56	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you must gain access to the affected machine or move the hard disk to another one (much more complicated)
10:56	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I booted the other machine with the livecd
10:56	<Seb3DGE>	I can type there as I write here
10:56	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: use the liveCD to boot in the affected machine
10:56	<AaronMT>	So which is the best IDE for C/C++ under Ubuntu?
10:56	<chijjer>	i updated my sources.list file to replace all the 'edgy's with 'feisty', ran 'sudo apt-get update', then ran 'sudo aptitude dist-upgrade' -- but it gave me this error: "No solution found within the allotted time.  Try harder? [Y/n] " -- so i sent 'y', and it did whatever it was doing for a longer period of time, SAME error again. what should i do? i can't keep "trying harder" forever lol
10:56	<tmbg>	clearzen, my resolv.conf file matches the IPs that my router uses that work. additionally I can resolve IP's no problem.
10:56	<tmbg>	when I try to connect using that IP, it times out.
10:56	<soundray>	AaronMT: emacs
10:56	<tmbg>	for example I can't even get to cnn.com
10:56	<debaser>	AaronMT: EMACS!!
10:56	<cherva>	soundray: thanks
10:56	<clearzen>	tmbg: What is the problem you are having then?
10:56	<chernobylrpgfree>	chijjer: That's not the recommended way.  Change them back, then run "gksu update-manager" and upgrade that way.
10:57	<debaser>	soundray: yeah
10:57	<delire>	debaser: ewww
10:57	<tmbg>	if i try to ftp to ftp.openbsd.org it hangs halfway through the motd.
10:57	<Dextorion>	Hattori: Take a look at /usr/sbin/pure-ftpd-wrapper
10:57	<IRCLemur>	Woohoo!!! Yay for Ubuntu 7.04. Finally... I get my wireless card to work!
10:57	<kahrytan>	soundray: I'll try that
10:57	<chijjer>	chernobylrpgfree: thank you
10:57	<tmbg>	clearzen, only like 1% of sites I try to go to are ultimately reachable. everything else times out.
10:57	<chernobylrpgfree>	chijjer: good luck
10:57	<AaronMT>	Emacs, I was looking for something similar to Visual Studio lol
10:57	<soundray>	IRCLemur: among the lucky few then ;)
10:57	<Jove``>	tmbg: are you using firefox and do you have a d-link router?
10:57	<debaser>	AaronMT: kdevelop
10:57	<AaronMT>	I save VI for those lonely nights
10:57	<delire>	AaronMT: according to the best developers in the world, Vim.
10:58	<atlantis>	in fedora there is a package that adds a lot of tab completions, like for different services, likes 'ssh <tab>' would look though /etc/hosts... does anyone know if there is a package that adds that functionality for ubuntu?
10:58	<debaser>	AaronMT: if you don't want to save millions of hours with emacs, use kdevelop or eclipse
10:58	<IRCLemur>	soundray: I've had a fun time with it... heh heh
10:58	<papatwilight>	wich vmware pacages do i need to install to it fully functional?
10:58	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I'm ready. The machine is booted in the livecd
10:58	<clearzen>	tmbg: have you tried stopping and restating your networking services?
10:58	<tmbg>	Jove``, yes I'm using firefox but I've tried the same in konquerer, ftp, etc. not a d-link router, no. it's an openbsd sparcstation pf/nat box.
10:58	<debaser>	delire: emacs!
10:58	<soundray>	AaronMT: there's nothing similar to VisualStudio, sorry. Linux has some bad software, but not *that* bad ;)
10:58	<tmbg>	clearzen, I rebooted the machine, which I imagine would have the same effect.
10:58	<safrus>	ya ok, i cant figure this out
10:58	<retarded-brb>	is there a way i can skip the installation of a component during install ?? i am getting stuck at WVDIAL setup (from alternate cd .. from edgy upgrade etc.. tryed ell options)
10:58	<clearzen>	tmbg: Did you get any errors when your networking was brought online?
10:59	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: open a terminal
10:59	<AaronMT>	I was ready to put on a flamesuit but then I saw the ;)
10:59	<mjc>	retarded-brb: verify your iso and re-burn it
10:59	<defjux_>	how do i restart gnome? i used to be able to go alt-ctrl-backspace to reboot shell.. it doesnt work anymore though
10:59	<tmbg>	clearzen, where do I need to look for them?
10:59	<safrus>	whats the command to edit ect/x11/xorg.conf
10:59	<Jove``>	tmbg: try turning off ipv6 in firefox
10:59	<coal>	wow
10:59	<soundray>	AaronMT: I've had a close escape then ;)
10:59	<DPic>	what's the command to open a directory as a root user?
10:59	<defjux_>	is there a ubuntu equivalent for alt-ctrl-delete?
10:59	<debaser>	safrus: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg,conf
10:59	<delire>	AaronMT: VIM has fantastic code browsers, great plugin architecture, tabs, variety of splitting modes, interactive undo history, mouse input, isn't as bloated as emacs and runs on most of the worlds Linux servers.

11:00	<Jove``>	tmbg: type about:config in the address line and set network.dns.disableIPv6 to true
11:00	<__david>	hello, i was wondering if anyone has ever tried to install ubuntu so that its root fs is on mdraid/luks-encrypt/lvm?
11:00	<antidrugue>	retarded: did you disable it?
11:00	<kiersie>	yes left ctrl left alt and delete

11:00	<teethdood>	How do I add un-ACE archive capabilities  to fileroller? (added the unace package)
11:00	<Seb3DGE>	done
11:00	<clearzen>	tmbg: go to a terminal and type sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart and see if it gives you errors. I believe you could find them with dmesg | grep eth0 as well
11:00	<ejm>	I hate ubuntu!!
11:00	<antidrugue>	can't you take it off than?
11:00	<awkorama>	I have a question regarding updating the package in repositories: why isn't azureus updated to latest version, when there is a clear bug in the version, that is in the repository?
11:00	<antidrugue>	ejm: why oh why?
11:00	<clearzen>	tmbg: assuming eth0 is the interface you are using to connect with
11:01	<retarded-brb>	without breaking open my laptop ??
11:01	<delire>	ejm: there are other distributions to try..
11:01	<tmbg>	yeah it is.
11:01	<antidrugue>	retarded: hum, of course it is not a possibility
11:01	<ejm>	actually, I just have a grub error 17.
11:01	<Jove``>	tmbg: are the errors *just* with firefox?
11:01	<chernobylrpgfree>	awkorama: probably because (a) the bug hasn't been fixed or (b) the repo maintainers don't know
11:01	<tmbg>	no.
11:01	<tmbg>	all sorts of things time out.
11:01	<Jove``>	ok
11:01	<teethdood>	!unace

11:01	<retarded-brb>	is there absolutly no way to skip this package in the terminal ??
11:01	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: you must mount the root partition

11:02	<PqSe>	lufis: yeah
11:02	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: give me the result of the mount command through pastebin pls
11:02	<chowmeined>	is there a tool that goes through all my installed packages and find the ones that aren't in use?
11:02	<lufis>	PqSe: burn it to cd and re-rip it?
11:02	<tmbg>	clearzen, about to. was trying to find log messages. nothing seems out of place
11:02	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: is that mount /
11:02	<Xenguy>	charles__: deborphan ?
11:02	<antidrugue>	ejm: your /boot/grub/menu.lst is pointing to the wrong root partition probably
11:02	<Seb3DGE>	?
11:02	<chernobylrpgfree>	awkorama: sounds like (b) is the case, but I didn't know azureus had a bug.. :)
11:02	<tmbg>	this will probably drop me.
11:02	<PqSe>	I don't have anyway of accessing windows to do that atm
11:02	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: no
11:02	<sam__>	ok do you do a startup script??

11:03	<lufis>	PqSe: ah, then i think you're probably out of luick
11:03	<soundray>	kahrytan: you now have to open the user config and tick the boxes to get all those capabilities back.
11:03	<Xenguy>	chowmeined:  deborphan ?

The computer it's (wirelessly) routed to is running Windows XP SP2. I've tried enabling it through Networking but it just doesn't do anything. I called Linksys' help line but they said that Linux doesn't support Linksys but I have a feeling I can make it work. So can anybody help? By the way, I don't know ANYTHI
11:03	<coal>	NG about Ubuntu. I'm very new. And I'm stupid as a brick

11:03	<ejm>	I think I'll put ubuntu on a 40 gig, and then whatever distro on the other 160.
11:03	<kahrytan>	soundray: you mean Users and Groups control? I can't It won't load completely.
11:03	<Jove``>	tmbg: I still think it could weel be ipv6 - do you have "alias net-pf-10 ipv6" in /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
11:03	<tmbg>	clearzen, ok it restarted.
11:03	<clearzen>	tmbg: Most logs are in var but I don't know off the top of my head exactly where you would look. /var/log/syslog maybe
11:03	<Jove``>	?
11:03	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: If this computer can connect to the internet, you'll need your driver disk for windows but you can make it run.
11:03	<clearzen>	tmbg: did it give you errors?
11:04	<coal>	uh, driver disk?
11:04	<antidrugue>	retarded: do you have the latest BIOS version for it ?
11:04	<soundray>	kahrytan: not even when you're logged in with the new username?
11:04	<reyn>	can I install a 32bit version of a lib on a 64bit system ?

11:05	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: If this computer can get online, run the command "sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter" first.  This is a utility that will get the firmware from the driver to make it work.
11:05	<retarded-brb>	ok
11:05	<retarded-brb>	hang on
11:05	<kahrytan>	soundray: yes. or firestarter.

11:08	<Xenguy>	grayman: yeh, I know =)

11:08	<soundray>	kahrytan: I see. It may be worth a try switching back to the (free) nv driver

11:13	<reyn>	surviver, mkay
11:13	<grayman>	Comrade-Sergei, well hmmm. Support period for Breezy ended this month so you might want to upgrade. You can try debinstaller to do so
11:13	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: there are no hard disks
11:13	<delf0s>	whats the comamnd line to launch the trash ?
11:13	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: not at all
11:13	<Morget>	mc44: nope, ubuntu/ubuntu is "incorrect username or password"
11:13	<antidrugue>	way too much traffic in here, hard to follow
11:13	<papatwilight>	how do i install xp useing vmware?
11:13	<coal>	E: couldn't find package bcm43xx-fwcutter
11:13	<soundray>	ejm: actually it's died down a bit. Last couple of days have been frantic
11:13	<chernobylrpgfree>	Teedy77: Lots of scroll, did you get that?
11:14	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: that's strange
11:14	<imon9>	hello..can someone tell me what it the command to un-make a installation that i compile with make install?
11:14	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: That's bad; is this computer not able to go online?
11:14	<ubd>	antidrugue: i need to create a torrent from my folder and files in it then upload the .torrent to a tracker. so people can get my folders
11:14	<Teedy77>	chernobylrpgfree: I don't have a wireless or lan listing i do show an RT2500 802.11g so thats my bet.
11:14	<antidrugue>	coal: do you have "universe" repository enabled?
11:14	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: probably because I erased the partition table?
11:14	<coal>	I'm not sure
11:14	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: maybe the way ubuntu manages devices
11:14	<boojit>	papatwilight: you want to install XP as a guest under a slackware host running vmware workstation?
11:14	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: ups
11:14	<coal>	I've done virtually nothing configuration-wise with my computer
11:14	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: well
11:14	<yell0w>	soundray, uhm it's a copy program ?

11:14	<antidrugue>	udb: personally i use azureus to do that, you can check azureus wiki for more details, or your favorite torrent client wiki
11:14	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: Try typing "nslookup google.com" and see if you get an answer
11:14	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: that's a major problem, I refused to believe it when you told me but...
11:14	<boojit>	oops sorry thought i was still in #slacwaqrek

11:15	<chernobylrpgfree>	haru: Ask your question and hope someone sees it =)
11:15	<soundray>	imon9: some programs provide a "make uninstall", but with most of them, you have to remove the installed files one by one
11:15	<\xq>	udb: Go here http://btfaq.com/serve/cache/56.html bittorent or check out another program like you are also being told
11:15	<haru>	my amarok keeps telling me xine was unable to initialize any audio drivers.. tho things worked fine till i had gstreamer

11:15	<haru>	chernobylrpgfree, hope so :)
11:15	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: how did you delet the partition table?
11:15	<papatwilight>	wich is the best way uder ubuntu?
11:15	<imon9>	no i didnt
11:15	<\xq>	haru: If you click where the panel is supposed to be (right click), nothing comes up? Not even in corner?
11:15	<MonKi>	who can help me with memory SD on feisty?
11:15	<imon9>	i guess i will just delete it from the sysmte manually
11:15	<reyn>	I have /usr/lib/libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0, but ldd ./binaryname returns:  libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0 =>	not found, is this a 32/64bit issue ?
11:15	<phaedra>	\xq,  Yes...
11:15	<yell0w>	soundray, i thought i was looking for wiping program ?
11:15	<Teedy77>	chernobylrpgfree: It is, however, I discovered an RT2500 post in the forums.
11:15	<coal>	nothing happens
11:16	<antidrugue>	paptwillight: which what is the best?
11:16	<coal>	oh
11:16	<theBishop>	i want to buy a USB Wireless network adapter for my brother to use in Ubuntu.  Of the ones available at Newegg, which work in linux with built-in drivers?
11:16	<soundray>	yell0w: to overwrite hda with zeros: 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda'
11:16	<chernobylrpgfree>	Teedy77: That's a good place to start then, sorry I couldn't be more help
11:16	<Teedy77>	So I'm going to take a look through that one first and then ask for more assistance if needed, thanks so far.
11:16	<coal>	lemme try enabling universe and such
11:16	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: it's a complicated problem
11:16	<haru>	\xq, panel for amarok ?
11:16	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: I used fdisk (dunno why, was looking for some way to fix the boot), it told me there are some errors to be fixed and they would be if I pressed "w"
11:16	<Morget>	mc44: nope, that didn't work either.  Odd that the liveCD should have a password.
11:16	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: yeah, you need that haha
11:16	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: how did you do it?
11:16	<papatwilight>	way to install xp under vmware-player

11:17	<mc44>	Morget: hrm.. it really shoudlnt
11:17	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: and now you can't boot only ubuntu
11:17	<\xq>	Sorry, this was to [kogi] 
11:17	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: but you can boot vista and xp
11:17	<haru>	\xq, the panels work fine.. except when i play something it gives me "xine was unable to initialize any audio drivers"

11:18	<grayman>	Seb3DGE, big lose?
11:18	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: where did you run fdisk from? xp, vista, ubuntu or other?
11:18	<Seb3DGE>	debaser: ubuntu livecd
11:18	<coal>	uh okay, i got no answer from nslookup google.com and there is no software repositories option in Administration
11:18	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: maybe you'll have to do that
11:19	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: you may have luck using testdisk
11:19	<Hattori>	'-U <umask for files>:<umask for dirs>': Change the file creation mask. -->	what should be the values to let it create files with rw attributes for owner and group and r for others?
11:19	<soundray>	Seb3DGE: if you're lucky, you can rescue your partitions with gpart (note not gparted)
11:19	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: You got no answer, therefore, no internet connection to that computer.  Do you have a USB storage device and USB ports on both computers?
11:19	<Seb3DGE>	hm
11:19	<Seb3DGE>	so there's still hope? :D
11:19	<antidrugue>	coal: hum? which version of Ubuntu are you using?

11:19	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: I don't have much experience with it but supposedly it can find lost partitions
11:19	<Seb3DGE>	you're fantastic guys
11:19	<leleobhz>	the (k)ubuntu dvd can be burned in DAO mode?
11:19	<leleobhz>	someone know?
11:19	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: OK, great.  You can download the bcm43xx-fwcutter package directly to your USB stick, and put it on the lappy that way.
11:19	<antidrugue>	coal: in System->ADministration , there is no Software Repositories?
11:19	<Seb3DGE>	all this happened just after I finally got everything working ok
11:20	<\xq>	[kogi]  ... when you click where panels are supposed to be (right click) does anything display or do they crash?
11:20	<coal>	none at all
11:20	<delf0s>	anyone know how i can get the trashcan icon on my desktop?
11:20	<Morget>	delf0s: Feisty will be the best OS to date .... when it lets me get in!  For some reason the liveCD is passworded here.
11:20	<coal>	and where can I download it?
11:20	<Seb3DGE>	reinstalling and tweaking everything again would be a pain in the ass :P
11:20	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: I am locating the file now.
11:20	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: fdisk is buggy as hell. use cfdisk next time ;)
11:20	<Seb3DGE>	so, what should I do now? sudo gpart?
11:20	<[koji] >	\xq can't get to panel if another app is active right now its xchat
11:20	<grayman>	Morget, errr, it's passworded?
11:20	<antidrugue>	coal: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu
11:20	<delf0s>	Morget: What OS do you have now?
11:20	<kahrytan>	soundray: New user now hangs on login now. When I removed nvidia binary,  User & Groups window did load but not won't. Nvidia binary isn't installed.
11:20	<coal>	thanks
11:20	<Seb3DGE>	mwe: I guess I'll never use anything similar again ;)
11:20	<Zerro>	hi i have a quick question: is there a launcher like in tirger x os for mac ?? (i mean that you can just type in the name of the app and it will launch it)

11:21	<Jelte>	how to make a playlist in exaile if i add tracks and i quit and i run again the track are not in the playlist
11:21	<coal>	ehm, antidrugue, that's for the universal repository right?
11:21	<soundray>	kahrytan: I'm sorry you ended up with such a messed up system.
11:21	<antidrugue>	Zerro: ALT+F2
11:21	<Teedy77>	Apologies again for literally being so totally foreign to this, but how do I use GTKWiki instead of Network-Manager?  I installed the package, but that means nothing to me.
11:21	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: well I recommend you look into testdisk if you want a chance of saving your partitions
11:21	<antidrugue>	coal: for all repositories
11:21	<grayman>	Morget, where did you get your livecd from?
11:21	<coal>	what should I do?
11:21	<[koji] >	\xq when i try show desktop, it says it is not supported by my windows manager
11:21	<leleobhz>	noone?
11:21	<wayah>	I am having a problem with my sound on my laptop.
11:21	<wayah>	can someone help?
11:21	<Morget>	delf0s + grayman : this is a blank machine with nothing on it, old dual celery 500.  I think some Feisty bits were compiled for 686, and the failures on celery are causing some passwording to kick in.
11:21	<grayman>	Morget, and where it asks you for a password?
11:21	<SlowLight>	Hi all, I woulad like to know if anyone have experiance with installing ubuntu as a lan server, anyone can help please?
11:21	<antidrugue>	coal: you should have all for: main, restricted, universe and multiverse
11:22	<Seb3DGE>	so.. sudo testdisk instead?
11:22	<debaser>	!sound
11:22	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
11:22	<[koji] >	\xq all after my feisty upgrade
11:22	<\xq>	[kogi]  you are saying multiple things. I am trying to understand. You open XChat and your PLANELS for gnome disappear (like one in the upper left) or your entire desktop crahses (gnome for example)?
11:22	<kahrytan>	soundray: I wish there was actual errors to report.  or Knew how it happen. I would file bug report then.
11:22	<atrus>	Seb3DGE: fwiw, last time i was in a position like that, 'parted' found all my partitions and rewrote the partition table appropriately.
11:22	<[koji] >	\xq they are all related
11:22	<mc44>	Morget: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414344&highlight=livecd+password
11:22	<mc44>	Morget: maybe a disk error?
11:22	<\xq>	[kogi]  Yes, so gnome crashes basically?
11:22	<Morget>	grayman: from UK Mirror Service, because the main Ubuntu site was aborting downloads after a few hundred meg.  But the MD5SUM is correct.
11:22	<deep>	How much power would be needed on a server that would port internet to 2 other computers?
11:22	<soundray>	Seb3DGE: testdisk and gpart do a complex job. You should read the docs to understand what they do and how to operate them.
11:23	<Morget>	mc44: thanks, looking
11:23	<coal>	i haev software SOURCES on the list
11:23	<[koji] >	i can't say gnome maybe the windows manager
11:23	<Seb3DGE>	should I try with parted first?
11:23	<antidrugue>	ok, i am out of here, just too much traffic in here, i am taking a break from this
11:23	<kahrytan>	soundray: Thank you for trying.
11:23	<\xq>	Compiz or something? What is being used?
11:23	<\xq>	GTK / Beryl?
11:23	<antidrugue>	coal: that's what i meant
11:23	<boojit>	deep you mean in terms of CPU power?
11:23	<Zerro>	oki thanks but there is no other where you can just type and it will search for the app and launch it like on mac ??
11:23	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: the package is at http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/bcm43xx-fwcutter/bcm43xx-fwcutter_006-1_i386.deb
11:23	<papatwilight>	or is qemu a better option?
11:23	<boojit>	deep: not much, if that's what you're asking.
11:24	<[koji] >	\xq whatever gnomes default
11:24	<soundray>	kahrytan: it may be worth reporting the problem as a bug even without error messages.
11:24	<deep>	boojit, yeah? as in, what cpufrequency would be best?
11:24	<[koji] >	\xq how do i check
11:24	<coal>	okay i downloaded it
11:24	<deep>	best and best. Minimum.
11:24	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: download that onto your USB storage and plug that into the laptop
11:24	<kahrytan>	soundray: but can't fixed if no one knows how to duplicate.
11:24	<kahrytan>	soundray or fix it.
11:24	<coal>	and run it>?
11:24	<chris90>	in /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf, i need to use /usr/bin/bluepin instead of bluez-pin. can someone help me do this because i cant work it out
11:25	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: yeah run it on the linux box
11:25	<soundray>	deep: you need very little computational power for that. Any old Pentium will do. Even a 486, but those are rare now...
11:25	<mwe>	Seb3DGE: I don't think gparted can find lost partitions
11:25	<boojit>	deep: you're just routing stuff between two interfaces, with probably a dhcp server thrown in for good measure. As soundray said, you can do that with a pentium.
11:25	<boojit>	lesser hardware does exactly that on linux-based network appliances
11:25	<debaser>	Seb3DGE: use testdisk
11:25	<coal>	okay gonna go run it
11:25	<cotton>	Which one do I download? http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
11:26	<Seb3DGE>	command not found
11:26	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: OK, it would help to have the laptop next to this computer
11:26	<Seb3DGE>	:P
11:26	<cotton>	And how do I execute a .bin?
11:26	<atrus>	Seb3DGE / mwe: no, but parted, its console-based cousin  can.
11:26	<deep>	Ah, okay, thanx m8s.
11:26	<Seb3DGE>	sudo apt-get install testdisk I imagine
11:26	<assasukasse>	i have a problem, i uninstalled mplayer but firefox still sees mplayer plugin and doesn't want to run some file with totem, what can i do
11:26	<mwe>	atrus: I see
11:26	<Morget>	mc44: I'll try reburning it then.  But it's bizarre that bad burns (if so) cause authentication to kick in.
11:26	<bud_>	hello, need help over gdm strange problem, im running ubuntu feisty on hp nx6110 laptop, with intel i915 graphic card
11:26	<soundray>	deep: you might actually consider buying a cheap router such as a Linksys WRT54GL, because it uses much less energy than a standard PC

11:27	<chernobylrpgfree>	jandro: check the ubuntu wiki on restricted formats
11:27	<Cosmo_>	on several games when I start them they are off kilter between my 2 monitors, is there a way I can force them into a window that can be moved betweem the monitors?
11:27	<atrus>	Seb3DGE: you can read the man page for parted and see if that helps, but you probabbly want to make sure you've got somebody familiar to help when you do it.
11:27	<safrus>	can i get some assistance with fixing my  resolution please?
11:27	<boojit>	although soundray is right about the cheap linksys, there's a lot to be said for what you'll learn setting up your own router
11:27	<deep>	soundray, i am using a router now. But it is buggy as hell. ;(
11:28	<soundray>	cotton: identify the names of the packages you want to get rid of. Then run 'sudo apt-get --purge remove package1 package2' etc.
11:28	<coal>	Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6
11:28	<boojit>	deep: it's a good exercise to do.
11:28	<soundray>	deep: what kind?
11:28	<coal>	not too sure that I got the libc6 part right but that's waht it said
11:28	<atrus>	Seb3DGE: gpart looks pretty good too though.

11:28	<atrus>	Seb3DGE: http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart/
11:28	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: UGH.  You'll need to wire that computer to the internet first.
11:28	<soundray>	deep: do you happen to have the exact model name?
11:29	<boojit>	soundray: yeah that's true. I thought you were saying, just using the out-of-the-box firmware
11:29	<coal>	oh boy
11:29	<hector>	how do I make my webcam to work?
11:29	<jandro>	chernobylrpgfree: i have already installed restricted formats
11:29	<safrus>	i did aptget for nvidia drivers, no fix, ddcprobe doesnt display vert/horiz, just resolutions, i edit xorg.conf with manufactures listed vert/horiz and no help there either
11:29	<coal>	well, the router/adapter are wireless, and I run on DSL
11:29	<deep>	soundray, VGR614, v. 7 (:
11:29	<bud_>	chernobylrpgfree: when i boot ubuntu and i get gdm i cant type my username and passwd in username and passwd field, but when i go to console (ctrl+alt+f1), and then go back in gdm, than i can type my username and passwd
11:29	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: that was a newer version you got there, i guess.  You could try <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/b/bcm43xx-fwcutter/bcm43xx-fwcutter_20060501-5_i386.deb">bcm43xx-fwcutter_20060501-5_i386.deb</a>?
11:29	<boojit>	of course, he could do it on a PC and use it for other stuff in addition to the router, which is exactly what i do.

11:29	<soundray>	boojit: for a router like that I don't think I would bother, though
11:29	<deep>	soundray, the bugs are at the port forwarding. If i add more then 7, the 8 one just "dissapears"
11:29	<jandro>	chernobylrpgfree: i can play perfectly another avi videos
=== axe is now known as Ax3
11:29	<deep>	soundray, cant change or delete it

11:30	<rogue780|laptop>	I'm trying to replace the usplash theme with a custom one in feisty, I replaced the usplash-theme-ubuntu.so file with my own usplash-theme-ubuntu.so file. the theme works when I'm shutting down, but when I start up it flashes for less than 1/4 of a second and the default theme appears...can someone help me figure this out? thanks
11:30	<Ax3>	does anyone have a copy of windows nx client 1.5 ?
11:30	<badkitt1>	Anyone familiar with ubuntu in vmware?

11:32	<Seb3DGE>	Well
11:32	<soundray>	deep: do you have the latest firmware on it?
11:32	<Seb3DGE>	I'll read the manuals of both

11:32	<Seb3DGE>	and see what I can do
11:32	<grayman>	badkitt1, and what seems to be the problem?
11:32	<Seb3DGE>	hopefully I'll rescue everything
11:32	<Seb3DGE>	:P

11:33	<jandro>	chernobylrpgfree: in the properties  tab of the file it shows video/x-msvideo and "Generic dv", any idea?
11:33	<soundray>	deep: your model sounds like it's fairly recent, so there's a chance that they will fix bugs like that.
11:33	<chernobylrpgfree>	jandro: Never heard of "generic dv".... that's new to me =(
11:33	<soundray>	deep: consider calling their support, too
11:33	<cotton>	sound ray, is it the command you gave me or: sudo apt-get remove --purge php5 mysql apache
11:33	<whaley_>	nvidia in fiesty problem:  I am unable to set my resolution to anything above 800x600 after the upgrade.  I have nvidia-legacy glx drivers installed.  In Edgy I could go up to higher resolutions.  My xorg.conf has higher resolutions listed in the modes subsection of each Display directive.  The driver I have listed is nvidia.  Any ideas?
11:34	<coal>	okay I installed it
11:34	<weltschmerz>	i think my upgrade to feisty destroyed all of my music.  Tons and tons and tons of music.
11:34	<chris90>	how do i restart a file/application with the terminal?
11:34	<weltschmerz>	for no reason.
11:34	<jandro>	chernobylrpgfree: would you know where to ask about it? i really need this video
11:34	<soundray>	cotton: the order does not matter
11:34	<dooglus>	weltschmerz: how'd it do that?
11:34	<badkitt1>	grayman: Im wondering... I have ubuntu getting dhcp from the router but the ip address it is getting is such that I cannot port forward ftp traffic from my router to it
11:34	<chernobylrpgfree>	jandro: I wouldn't, video just isn't my thing, i do networking =)
11:34	<mstevens>	weltschmerz: feisty comes with a new "taste filter" subsystem. Your music sucks.
11:34	<cotton>	soundray: you didn't have 'remove' you your commad
11:34	<jandro>	chernobylrpgfree: ok, thanks
11:34	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: good.  Now, you need the SYS file from the windows driver;
11:35	<coal>	okay which windows driver
11:35	<deep`>	soundray, i think i updated it now. Ill try adding some new forwards to see if it works. :)

11:35	<soundray>	cotton: yes, it did
11:35	<chowmeined>	it is so easy to install beryl
11:35	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: the driver for the wireless card.  Is it the same kind of card for the laptop and the windows machine?
11:35	<grayman>	badkitt1, hmmm, what kind of networking it got? do you get a seperate ip for it?
11:35	<randy>	Hey all.
11:35	<weltschmerz>	mstevens then when rsync just ran, to back up my database on my second hard drive, which is just for backup storage of my music, it erased all my music.
11:35	<coal>	woah
11:35	<weltschmerz>	on the backup.
11:35	<grayman>	badkitt1, or share hosts ip
11:35	<weltschmerz>	why did feisty do this?
11:35	<badkitt1>	grayman: It is a different ip address than the host computer yes
11:35	<coal>	i don't think i have a card :c
11:35	<safrus>	anyone that can help me with resolution problem?
11:35	<coal>	it's just an adapter
11:35	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: same thing haha
11:36	<randy>	Anyone use a wintv pvr go under Feisty?
11:36	<coal>	lul
11:36	<grayman>	badkitt1, should work normally
11:36	<coal>	i'm not sure where the driver is
11:36	<soundray>	[22:28]  <soundray>	cotton: identify the names of the packages you want to get rid of. Then run 'sudo apt-get --purge remove package1 package2' etc.
11:36	<Zerro>	do someone can help me with a problem with beryl ? when i run beryl-manager after it starts up all my windows get border less and i can't move them also none of the themes works but there is a cube desktop etc.
11:36	<woodyn87>	At wits end here, installed and mounted a second (slave in windows terms) drive, can see it in file browser but it has "root" as the owner and I can't access any ideas?
11:36	<delire>	isn't there a #beryl?
11:36	<grayman>	badkitt1, what prevents you from forwarding?
11:36	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: thats the important thing, really.  You'll need the driver disk for that adapter, or at least the driver's SYS file.
11:36	<badkitt1>	grayman but the regular ip is xxx.xxx.0.x but the ubuntu ip is getting xxx.xxx.258.x or something
11:36	<ferret>	delire: #ubuntu-effects
11:36	<ferret>	Zerro: ^
11:36	<mstevens>	weltschmerz: I have no clue actually, I just couldn't resist the joke
11:36	<Jove``>	Zerro: try "reload window decorator" from beryl-manager
11:36	<dooglus>	weltschmerz: so you think rsync erased your music?
11:36	<coal>	oh
11:36	<weltschmerz>	i had tons of stuff in /usr/share/ that feisty DESTROYED!!!
11:36	<coal>	i need the disk it came with?
11:36	<delire>	Zerro: #ubuntu-effects is best for you
11:37	<grayman>	badkitt1, hm
11:37	<splinter>	Zerro: right click on the beryl icon at the top, i think theres an option to restart theme manager
11:37	<badkitt1>	So the router tells me I cant forward to this ip because of perhaps a different subnet???
11:37	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: if you don't have it, check http://www.driverguide.com/ for it (user "drivers" pw "all")
11:37	<weltschmerz>	dooglus once the source was deleted, rysc --delete obviously deleted the destination to match.
11:37	<weltschmerz>	oh my GOD.

11:38	<weltschmerz>	no wait..i think i found it.
11:38	<coal>	okay i should look up the model of the adapter I have right?
11:39	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: Yeah.
11:39	<Nekomagesdesu>	would anyone happen to have a working vnc service how-to to allow remote machines onto my current display?

11:40	<Nekomagesdesu>	soundray, I can't connect from another machine using that
11:40	<coal>	found one
11:40	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: mysql.sock is usually created by mysql.  Make sure that your tmp drive is mounted OK (should be listed in the output of mount)
11:40	<woodyn87>	and you have to forward the port on your router if the other machine is outside your network.
11:41	<Zerro>	oh yea and another think how do i get a channel on ubuntu server ?
11:41	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: OK, get that and look for a SYS file inside it.
11:41	<randomwalker>	i keep hearing about vmware in feisty.. is it free?
11:41	<soundray>	Nekomagesdesu: you should be able to, though. Is there a firewall in between?
11:41	<Deinumite>	is there anyway to boot from the iso if its on my harddrive?

11:42	<Nekomagesdesu>	soundray, that enters the port number for the windows version
11:42	<woodyn87>	you have to be signed on to the desktop more accurately someone has to be signed on
11:42	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: its got to be a problem with mysql then, that's a bit beyond me.
11:42	<bud_>	chernobylrpgfree: yeah, thanks

11:45	<briank>	Hi, I just ran the fedora core 6 live cd, and now after testing it, I want to reboot into my normal ubuntu grub menu, but it says insert system disk, any ideas on how to get things back to normal?!?
11:45	<adaptr>	woodyn87 is there anything on the drive ?
11:45	<mskadu>	but cannot config his wireless to connect with WEP/PSK
11:45	<woodyn87>	No, and it's formatted ext3
11:45	<soundray>	woodyn87: create a directory in it with sudo and change the owner and group to your primary user name.

11:46	<Wiseguy>	hey guys, im watching my firewall log in realtime with vuurmuur, im getting massive amounts of udp packets from a HUGE range of IP addresses and on almost every port you cna think of... is this like a ntpd server or osmething running? or what would be running by deafult that would cause this?
11:46	<woodyn87>	by way of gparted
11:46	<capiira>	hmm how can i completely uninstall ubuntu.desktop after installing the kubuntu one ?
11:46	<Wiseguy>	actually i take that back
11:46	<soundray>	briank: you've somehow lost grub. Recover it with the "after Windows..." instructions:

11:46	<yell0w>	capiira, sudo aptitude remove ubuntu-desktop
11:46	<antidrugue>	ok, back again
11:46	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: lan-express

11:47	<Wiseguy>	both via tcp and udp
11:47	<akey>	hello
11:47	<mwe>	I think that will just remove the meta package if ubuntu-desktop was not installed using aptitude
11:47	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: what method are you using to configure WEP?
11:47	<yell0w>	capiira, that, and all the pckages it depends on
11:47	<briank>	soundray, thanks!
11:47	<akey>	i cant see youtube vids in firefox, can anybody help me?

11:47	<mskadu>	well. i dont know a lot, but I am using network-admin
11:47	<chernobylrpgfree>	akey: make sure you have the flash 9 plugin
11:48	<yell0w>	capiira, at least that's what i think that does, did you try it ?
11:48	<Nekomagesdesu>	beryl just crashed vnc viewer XD
11:48	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree:  well. i dont know a lot, but I am using network-admin

11:48	<soundray>	Lars_G: cd to /var/cache/apt/archives and force the installation with 'dpkg -i --force-overwrite python-clearsilver_*deb
11:48	<akey>	i have it,
11:48	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: that's what i wanted =)  so you type the WEP Key into the box but it doesn't work?
11:48	<antidrugue>	akey: do you have flash installed? "sudo apt-get install flashplayer-nonfree"
11:48	<yell0w>	capiira, that's strange
11:48	<akey>	i have a 64 bit
11:48	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: no
11:48	<capiira>	removed 1 package
11:48	<capiira>	heh
11:48	<Lars_G>	soundray: thanks, that Way I avoid redownload.
11:48	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree:  thats how i have config-ed it several times before
11:48	<akey>	so, i cant install it from macromedia
11:48	<Deinumite>	anyway to boot the iso from your HD?
11:48	<vox754>	akey, NO! don't use the 64 bit one, use the 32 bit distro
11:48	<soundray>	Lars_G: use sudo of course
11:48	<antidrugue>	akey: oh,... there is wrapper for flash on 64 bits, don't remember the name
11:48	<frolle>	chowmeined, hey pal, everything is running perfectly :)
11:49	<Lars_G>	soundray: yeah
11:49	<chowmeined>	frolle: excellent, I am glad it is working
11:49	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: i dont know what i am doing wrong
11:49	<yell0w>	capiira, it works on mine
11:49	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: OK, of course the AP is listed as well?
11:49	<sicker>	in mysql configuration you set up a user and a pass to run mysql ?
11:49	<selinuxium>	HI all, I am having problems writing to a NTFS USB HD. It reports as a read only system. Feisty. Any ideas?
11:49	<antidrugue>	akey: but flash is not the last of your trouble if you are on 64 bits, you'll find most things multimedia related troublesome
11:49	<mskadu>	yes
11:49	<yell0w>	capiira, check pm
11:49	<akey>	vox754, should i reinstall the whole ubuntu?
11:49	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: wlist -a shows it to me
11:49	<capiira>	ok
11:49	<arooni>	chernobylrpgfree: thanks a lot!!!!  i asekd folks in mysql and they helped me out!
11:50	<mwe>	sudo apt-get --purge remove libgnome2-0 libgnome2-common will probably get rit of most of it
11:50	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: that's good, it seems like the driver is setup and it works..
11:50	<SlowLight>	dear I would like to kno0w if Ubuntu is capabile to be a server for a 30 computer lan network
11:50	<sicker>	in mysql configuration you set up a user and a pass to run mysql ? somebody can help me ?
11:50	<soundray>	!ntfs-3g >	selinuxium, please read ubotu's private message
11:50	<chernobylrpgfree>	arooni: Yay, I did my good deed of the day!  cheers!
11:50	<ohshitt>	I just updated/upgrade update-manager and tzdata, ignoring the 'feisty fawn available' message and now i do not get the 7.04 upgrade available anymore? anyone get that
11:50	<vox754>	!flash64 | akey, it is easier than battling but
11:50	<ubotu>	akey, it is easier than battling but: You can run Flash, Real, and Java plugins in AMD64 bit computers with Firefox. see the steps to follow at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava
11:50	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: that wifi card has been in use for a long time
11:50	<soundray>	SlowLight: sure
11:50	<DoctorOwl>	I have XP on hda.  I have a free disk on hdc.  I installed ubuntu onto hdc, but when it rebooted grub said stage 1.5 error 16 and hangs.  So I booted from my xp cd to do fixmbr and now I can boot into windows fine.  The question is, how do I make things so I can boot into ubuntu now?
11:50	<frolle>	chowmeined, for the moment i am trying to find a solution for my nzb files
11:50	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: It sounds like you might have the wrong WEP key (sounds kinda dumb, but it's possible)?
11:50	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: but the person changed the router and the new one was config-ed for WEP/PSK
11:50	<fiction>	is there a way to alter the taskbar looks? besides transparancy and all
11:50	<akey>	i dont take you
11:51	<chowmeined>	frolle: those newsgroup files?
11:51	<coal>	okay i'm finally  back
11:51	<jrib>	!themes >	fiction (see the private message from ubotu)
11:51	<haru>	can someone help me .. i am getting no sound with xine.. since i uninstalled gstreamer engine
11:51	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: that was the first thing i thought as well. But the same key works when i reboot into win-xp
11:51	<coal>	I downloaded my driver
11:51	<coal>	what now?
11:51	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: ok, did you find the SYS file inside the driver?
11:51	<cables>	Is there a script that is run when I suspend the machine? If so, where can I find it?
11:51	<fiction>	jrib: but just the taskbar
11:51	<micahspoop>	will setting my cpu frequency help battery life on my laptop?
11:51	<jrib>	fiction: what do you want to do with it?
11:51	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: OK, well that's ruled out.  The next step is troublesome; does it work when you turn off WEP?
11:51	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: It should be named BCMWL5.SYS or BCMWL5A.SYS
11:51	<jrib>	cables: maybe /etc/acpi/ somewhere, but just a guess
11:51	<chowmeined>	frolle: If you want something to download those, check out klibido
11:52	<frolle>	chowmeined, yeah, i used to use hellanzb, which is an amazing grabber, but the new version is quite unstable..
11:52	<antidrugue>	coal: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
11:52	<coal>	should I run it?
11:52	<fiction>	jrib: make it look more stylish. like kde in a way
11:52	<coal>	the driver?
11:52	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: get that SYS file on to your USB stick
11:52	<coal>	on the computer I'm on now
11:52	<chowmeined>	frolle: except it loads KDE junk :(
11:52	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: i cant try that as it is a shared router

11:54	<antidrugue>	cotton: certainly not one of us :)
11:54	<cotton>	antidrugue, Why?
11:54	<nihil_>	soundray, first person perspective
11:54	<woodyn87>	Installed and mounted a second (slave in windows terms) drive, can see it in file browser but it has "root" as the owner and I can't access any ideas?
11:54	<kane77>	nihil_, what is fpp?
11:54	<mwe>	kylecasey: /dev/dvd is not present? or you don't have permission maybe
11:55	<monkey_instinct>	my webcam is recognize in the device manager as usb 2.0 camera but is not working with any webcam viewer, any ideas?
11:55	<kane77>	nihil_, got that
11:55	<antidrugue>	cotton: i don't know, i just know i wouldn't trust you with my server, in fact i wouldn't trust anyone
11:55	<Possum>	Is the only way to get java working on amd64 to install 32-bit fx?
11:55	<coal>	i found a bunch of .SYS files
11:55	<chernobylrpgfree>	mskadu: you've kind of stumped me... if iwlist shows your AP then everything is pretty much go...
11:55	<coal>	which am I looking for?
11:55	<kylecasey>	mwe i have two drives and theyre both there
11:55	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: you want the one for XP most likely.
11:55	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: yes, thats why the person finally came to me
11:55	<frolle>	chowmeined: well... my gfx is so old
11:55	<mwe>	kylecasey: /dev/dvd exists?
11:55	<cotton>	antidrugue: when I click something in the file browser, it doesn't do anything
11:55	<coal>	i found a folder called WINXP
11:55	<kane77>	nihil_, i'd say tremulous, enemy territory, true combat elite
11:55	<mwe>	kylecasey: ls /dev/dvd confirms that?
11:55	<mskadu>	chernobylrpgfree: maybe there's one thing that can help
11:55	<coal>	two SYS files
11:55	<antidrugue>	cotton: what do you mean ?
11:55	<cables>	If anyone answered my question before about a suspend script, I didn't get it because my computer crashed. Could you re-send it?
11:55	<mskadu>	when i tried using wlassist

11:58	<kylecasey>	mwe i tried that but it craps out when i try to burn a dvd
11:58	<chernobylrpgfree>	coal: It's really a USB external adapter?
11:58	<Tom_g>	soundray: you ever heard anything about it?
11:58	<coal>	yup
11:58	<cotton>	antidrugue: YOu know when you don't have a index file, you get that screen showing all the files/folders? Well, on my server, if I were to click one of those files, nothing would happen, the IRL would change accordingly, but the page will remain the same
11:58	<coal>	we had to get that specific

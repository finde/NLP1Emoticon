[negative] [00:19] <linkmaster03> jesus :(
[positive] [00:21] <Fishscene> The servers are undergoing the equivelant of DDoS attack- except it's ALL legitimate traffic. :)
[positive] [00:24] <alienbrain> x1250, I understand, but I'm trying to assess how much time I need to spend after upgrading :)
[positive] [00:27] <alienbrain> Mimi, sure, that gives me higher hopes! :)
[positive] [00:27] <alienbrain> x1250, I see, but I can only install from the CD at the moment, not very good bandwidth :)
[positive] [00:27] <alienbrain> So guys, thank you a lot. I will give it a chance! :)
[negative] [00:30] <IntangibleLiquid> thanks god! Partition editor says my harddisk space is unallocated :( What am I supposed to do? I'm doing booting XP and PCLinuxOS and want to swicth to Ubuntu :(
[positive] [00:31] <ZarathustraDK> haha, and here I thought it was hardy's fault :)

[negative] [00:56] <bododo_> i'm having troubles with my bcm4318 wifi on a ibook G4 :(
[negative] [00:56] <bododo_> it just doesn't work :(
[positive] [00:58] <unop> Light|DC, part of the upgrade process is canonical ensuring it's servers are capable, so it's a testing time :)
[negative] [00:58] <bododo_> nibsa1242b: i did :( and yes you're right
[positive] [01:05] <smallfoot-> oddalot, i did :)
[negative] [01:05] <smallfoot-> oddalot, yes, and it does not support EDID :(
[positive] [01:06] <nomopofomo> nibsa1242b, that's what I thought :) it's okay though, i found that my harddrives aren't hda1 etc anymore but sda etc

[positive] [01:17] <bradlis7> yup, i think i'd like it if i could get 3d working :)
[positive] [01:20] <Liquidy> raiderxx: if you upgraded all of your applications on your previous distro you wouldn't have to see any diference :)
[positive] [01:21] <clay> yeah, apt-get is having a hard today :)
[positive] [01:23] <unop> mattycoze, shoulda come in here first :)
[positive] [01:24] <unop> mattycoze, ohh, ahh well - not to worry, you can redistribute the ISO to friends and family :)

[positive] [01:49] <moveax> KyleK: ah, resolved that too, n/m :)
[positive] [01:52] <sammy> for anyone else looking for mirrors, synaptic does a great job of pinging all the mirrors and chosing the best one for you. I'll suggest it 'cause it worked well for me :) just select 'repositories' and find your way to select a new mirror, there'll be a button.
[positive] [01:52] <sammy> smick: as long as we're still using X, I doubt the dual screen configuration will be any easier in this decade :)
[positive] [01:53] <binarybandit> phiqtion, type /j #compiz-fusion and ask them there :)
[positive] [01:57] <sileni> thanks guys appreciate it :)
[positive] [02:03] <vi1985> Seems there is a stream of questions here... Let me rephrase: Is it possible to repartition the disc without reformatting (lots of valuable info) when installing Hardy? My Lenovo T60 won't let me do it...   Anyone, help :)
[negative] [02:04] <NAiL> Any Xen gurus here? Having some issues with Xen after upgrading to Hardy :(
[positive] [02:06] <twinkie_addict> thats why i run opera :)

[positive] [02:08] <dabbill> Exodus, aye :)
[positive] [02:11] <KyleK> k[5\5]: theres no fancy gui for text, but you can watch stuff scroll by :)
[negative] [02:14] <sammy> mojo: that's always a good idea, especially after an upgrade. it's taken me 50 little steps to get my video where I want it, I dread the update :(
[negative] [02:16] <RodGo> :( feel like a dumb here waiting for hours
[positive] [02:22] <sammy> rich_freecomm: you can always ask for it back when you log in, which is what I've been doing for.. however many years now :)
[positive] [02:23] <iznuics> ubuntu__: :)
[positive] [02:24] <twinkie_addict> nice 504 k trandsfer :)

[negative] [02:37] <CaptainMorgan> bazhang, I'm burning another CD now.. to see if it makes any difference ... :(
[positive] [02:40] <sean_> tanath: figures. ::)
[positive] [02:40] <samalex> hehe, apt-get upgrade = 0 packges :)  Nice ..
[positive] [02:46] <twinkie_addict> ooo its installing :)
[positive] [02:52] <sammy> genji_: the syntax is in the file, or try man sysctl.conf :)
[positive] [02:58] <Ubuntong> erat123:  yes, and it's easy enough for me to use. That says a lot. :) You'll want to get some templates for it too.
[positive] [02:58] <KyleK> Jordanjay29: I've also got an HP, DV6624CA :)
[positive] [02:58] <h00k> I broke my nVidia card already -- apparently.  I had just reinstalled completely. :)
[positive] [03:00] <KyleK> Jordanjay29: firefox is lousy at searching through history, but I remember all the commands :)

[positive] [03:12] <Odd-rationale> juano__: go for it. I'm seeding all the alternative cd's :)
[positive] [03:13] <juano__> Odd-rationale: good job :)
[positive] [03:13] <sammy> lopin: I've been trying to tell people once I changed my mirror everything went quickly, but I guess there is something to wanting more iso discs out there :)
[positive] [03:14] <KyleK> professor_: download from: its a dropdown, click around in there :)
[positive] [03:16] <KyleK> ffm_: !calmdown > ffm_ :)
[negative] [03:17] <binarybandit> ffm_, not just for the road :(
[positive] [03:21] <eklof> Hi all! anyone upgraded a 6.06 server to 8.04 yet? Did it work? :)
[positive] [03:21] <twinkie_addict> the repos must realy be hit hard , i cant refresh my apt list :)
[positive] [03:21] <shane2peru> ffm_, that could be very handy, where do I find out about it?  Wouldn't apt on DVD be more efficient. :)
[positive] [03:22] <nickrud> black_13 ah, server :) . You need to go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors , pick one and edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[positive] [03:22] <eklof> Kl4m: I need some test-users before me :)
[positive] [03:22] <underdog5004> lopin, there's nothing to document, so many users trying to download 700+ Mb from a few servers is basically a DDOS against the servers...unintentional, but there you go :)
[positive] [03:26] <HardyOne> gvieira: if you did the update yesterday you are already there :)
[positive] [03:27] <underdog5004> lopin, lol, not much else you can do :)
[positive] [03:27] <bcardarella> sammy: yeap, that was it. Thanks :)
[negative] [03:28] <cameron122000> upgrade is being slow :(
[positive] [03:32] <Kl4m> pawan: stay around and watch the problems flow :)
[negative] [03:40] <scorpfromhell> what is the partial upgrade after upgrade to hardy that's been taking me ages? :(
[positive] [03:41] <scorpfromhell> no, am not complaining about slow servers, I am expecting that :) hence torrented the alternate cd
[negative] [03:42]  * jeriath is sad cuz synergy doesnt work with 8.04 :(
[negative] [03:49] <fyrfaktry> shpook: not in North florida either :(
[positive] [03:50] <fyrfaktry> ffm_: insane :)
[positive] [03:50] <KyleK> im using x86_64 okay now :)
[negative] [03:52] <DBautell> thanks, cox! ... :(
[positive] [03:55] <dragobr_> :)
[positive] [04:01]  * calc doesn't bother with getting releases on release day, he downloads them a few days before :)
[positive] [04:01] <calc> Kl4m: ah that is good news then :)
[positive] [04:01] <x1250> calc, me too :)
[positive] [04:01] <calc> Kl4m: which is why you should check the ip address :)
[positive] [04:06] <pipegeek> first of all, congrats on hardy :)
[positive] [04:06] <nickrud> calc no, I'll be waiting till the beta. (and I wondered why some worked, thanks a bunch :)
[positive] [04:10] <calc> nickrud: ok :)
[positive] [04:10] <calc> nickrud: ah :)
[positive] [04:11] <calc> nickrud: so you have been using debian almost as long as me :)
[positive] [04:14] <dragobr_> latitu: so you are on hardy final :)
[positive] [04:15] <dragobr_> latitu: yep.. there were no updates on this last two days, just that :)
[negative] [04:16] <PMantis> HardyOne: Thanks! It's up to 64 days now. :(
[negative] [04:22] <iDN> :(
[positive] [04:24] <Kl4m> Mythril: (sorry last one :) )  there is also grsync which is a graphical frontend to it, and some others.
[positive] [04:25] <sahak> iDN: Armenian :)
[positive] [04:25] <juano__> Kl4m: lol, silly me :) your right
[positive] [04:26] <iDN> sahak: i see. are you jewish? and you're correct in your assumption, your name triggered my question. :)
[negative] [04:27] <aoeuid> hey, could anyone help me install hardy? :(
[positive] [04:29] <calc> x1250: yep :)
[positive] [04:29] <calc> x1250: thats what i did :)
[positive] [04:30] <nickrud> arbir_ and third, I just tested it :)
[positive] [04:30] <iDN> sahak: no, i thought you were implying that being jewish and being armenian is contradictory. apparently, it was a misunderstanding. and yes, i am jewish. :)
[negative] [04:33] <nickrober> Utalcn2me: i have the volume really low, but it's scratchy constantly, someone else with a computer similar to mine has the same problem on the forums so i guess i'll just wait for a fix :(
[positive] [04:43] <nhaines> ffm_: Thank you, I'm aware.  :)
[negative] [04:46] <zcat[1]> Updated this machine last night.. three others won't even apt-get update ... I think I'll just wait a few days :(
[negative] [04:56] <mattycoze> harriseldon no there is no placeholder for the card :(
[negative] [05:04] <bladezor> x1250: Yeah, shame on me :(
[positive] [05:12] <nhaines> thezanke: the best way is to remove the kernel packages using Synaptic.  It's a good idea to leave the old one around for a week or so, just in case you find any bugs.  :)
[positive] [05:13] <nhaines> Kl4m: it seems like they should be.  :)  But I don't recall.
[positive] [05:15] <nhaines> mheath: You won't have to wait forever.  :)
[positive] [05:22] <morphy> cool.. thanks :)
[positive] [05:28] <nhaines> pipegeek: did you have luck with that? :)
[negative] [05:39] <Rycher> harriseldon: allright sweet. Thanks for the help. I gotta go to bed cause i got school in the morning :( Cya....
[positive] [05:40] <hilts50> harriseldon: thanks  :)
[positive] [05:45] <morphy> danke, checking :)
[negative] [05:46] <morphy> Kl4m, I tried following the steps mentioned there for Persistent live USB install.. I guess those are for 7.10, it dint seem to work for me :(
[positive] [05:46] <NAiL> 9mb/sec isn't half bad speed :)
[positive] [05:51] <Gnodab1> :)
[positive] [05:59] <IcemanV9> MeatGrinder: another vote for utorrent :)
[negative] [06:01] <pawbie> I haven't even managed to boot 8.04 yet....  :(
[positive] [06:03] <Mickey> ok, thanks, i'll keep trying :)
[positive] [06:03] <nhaines> pawbie: Oh, it's happened every 6 months for about the last 2 years, at least.  :)
[negative] [06:04] <morphy> its just this version that I am facing this problem :(
[positive] [06:05] <therealnanotube> pawbie: ehrm... the slashdot effect happens every day. :)  though probably it's mostly bandwidth saturation rather than server pounding per se.
[negative] [06:14] <jtmonz> bcgrown: hmm, sorry... ati here :(
[positive] [06:15] <nickrud> talcite but resizing issues? None that I can think of :)
[positive] [06:16] <Radiobuzz> pawbie, oh, LOL, ok thanks. I'll still wait to see if anyone has another idea though :)
[positive] [06:20] <iusegnulinux> hi all, just booted into 8.04 :)
[positive] [06:20] <unop> gogeta, i can't say i am surprised :) it's well, expected
[positive] [06:22] <KyleK> i wish b43 worked for me :)
[positive] [06:24] <nickrud> gogeta I don't try, I track a couple people at a time :)
[positive] [06:25] <ceil420> Shadow_X, i was, but it was because i had broken packages installed (in my case, a few language packs). i removed the offending packages, and i'm upgrading now :)
[positive] [06:27] <unop> FastZ, well, if you install and use tasksell , you have the option on any ubuntu/debian machine :)
[positive] [06:27] <KyleK> ceil420: im running ubuntu on my server :) but its just personal server

[positive] [07:19] <nickrud> AdrianStrays all I can say is everything worked fine for me (beta install nearly 2 months ago, and updates since then. First time that Works for Me™ :)

[positive] [12:36] <iKar> does hardy support ati :)
[positive] [12:37] <case_> Kirby, are you that deseperate? :))

[negative] [14:49] <dublpaws> the repositories are slammed :(. is there one which is not serving upgrades?
[positive] [14:58] <Joelito> Thanks dystopianray, that help me :)
[positive] [14:58] <PMantis> spiniker: Would've been quicker to download the alternate or DVD via torrent, and upgrade with local disc. :)
[positive] [15:00] <loder> that was an excessive use of the word actually sorry about that :)
[positive] [15:01] <loder> LainIwakura well as to the wisdom I couldn't say - I'm just a newbie who can search :)
[positive] [15:07] <PMantis> Scunizi: I do appreciate the effort, though. :)
[negative] [15:10] <rohan> is there _any_ way to install ubuntu using the iso but without burning the cd? all the cdrw's that i've got are bad :(
[negative] [15:12] <rohan> Nith: no, second computer is windows only :(
[positive] [15:13] <Sake> slestak: I dunno what that means. I just like how putty uses a small font and works with everything. :)

[positive] [15:20] <ddrplayer512> I don't usually upgrade over the Internet on the day it comes out. I can't install software for Hardy. I'm glad I didn't upgrade from Dapper. I was considering that... Scary... :)
[positive] [15:21] <rohan> bazhang: but will work great, thanks a lot :)
[positive] [15:21] <ddrplayer512> bazhang: Yeah, I know. But I figured that the repos would be flooded, and I wanted Hardy NOW. So... :)
[positive] [15:23] <gord_> indian_munnda: err, yes, but it didnt work, and it probably should have :)
[positive] [15:23] <snadge> nibsa1242b: cheers that worked thanks :)

[positive] [15:38] <gord_> indian_munnda:hmmm, are you sure you havent mis-typed the MAC ? thats my usual mistake :)
[positive] [15:48] <Pilha> ok ppl, many thx for the help - worst case is I wait for the servers to lighten up :)
[positive] [15:48] <shadow_> thats mainly because i don't know what im doing most of the time :)

[positive] [16:55] <Krimpet> it seems a bit unpolished and space-wasting for all of my firefox windows to say "Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 5" in the title - just wondering if there's a way to trim it down :)

[positive] [17:23] <Mimi> Mapp:  we can get a better one working for you so go to sofware sources,.... then on that window look on the center,  click where it says Download From... then "Other" then "select the best server" let it do its thing, then click Choose server, close, and youre good to go :)

[positive] [17:40] <Raits> kakado: anyway, thank you, it's working great now:)
[negative] [17:40] <Mimi> mapp :( did it download most of them? Might be some packages that are being updated and such, I got the same problem earlier, try sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade from terminal, after you close that Sources window
[positive] [17:43] <Mimi> dave11 if you're installing and keeping windows, try wubi :)  otherwise... make sure youre burning at the LOWEST speed possible, and I assume youve checked md5sum

[positive] [18:10] <ddrplayer512> suwed: You don't really have to upgrade, but you'll get new versions of new software, your software will be supported for about another year vs. LTS for another 3 years, and you'll have bragging rights! :)
[positive] [18:13] <ddrplayer512> No problem, I hope that helps. :)
[positive] [18:16] <suweid> pjoul: I want it, I just want to know why the hoopla! :)

[positive] [18:21] <pjoul> suweid: yes, that's your bussiness :)
[positive] [18:35] <bullium> Steufeubeu: worked great :) thnx a bunch...now I can do some work
[positive] [18:35] <suweid> eyyYo: that sounds like proxying, google proxy ubuntu or something. :)
[positive] [18:37] <suweid> jburl, just reinstall the whole shebang. And if that's not possible you can cry in a corner. That's what I usually do when my files get wasted anyway. :)
[positive] [18:38] <suweid> mut80r: No, he's no newbie. I think he'll manage. :)
[positive] [18:38] <eyyYo> suweid: And I dont have much time, thats the biggest problem :)

[positive] [20:50] <nucco> Skapare: yes, I know that, the problem is *how* to fix it :)
[positive] [20:54] <nucco> neztiti: you mean ubuntu update downloads are slow? that's to be expected. a new version just got released :)
[negative] [20:56] <Dusk_> IcemanV9: it didn't :( restarting changes verything
[positive] [20:57] <Seveas> koomber, get rid of vista :)
[negative] [20:59] <DBautell> ok, dassouki_ , you need more knowledgeable help than I :(
[positive] [20:59] <Skapare> mut80r: that means he can ignore dumb questions like mine :)
[positive] [21:00] <Daisuke_Ido> cvd-pr, #ubuntu+1...  nah, just kidding, it's okay to ask here now :)
[positive] [21:01] <mut80r> Vlet: yes :)
[positive] [21:03] <gogeta> Skapare i orderd a 8.04 cd :)
[positive] [21:05] <Daisuke_Ido> i stand corrected :)
[positive] [21:06] <flithm> _lemsx1_: hey that's not a bad idea :)
[positive] [21:06] <Administrator_> except maybe time.. :)
[positive] [21:07] <flithm> fbc: haha thanks :)
[positive] [21:08] <Daisuke_Ido> but the recovery partition is feisty, i was wondering if there were a way to update that to a hardy recovery :)
[positive] [21:08] <Arky44> ubus: it still might be though :)
[positive] [21:08] <nucco> joshua__: the windows name of the pc will work fine too :)
[positive] [21:09] <Daisuke_Ido> koomber, i was just kinda thinking out loud :)
[positive] [21:10] <Arky44> gogeta: :)
[positive] [21:10] <shane2peru> I'm batting a 1000 today. :)  am I asking too hard of questions?
[positive] [21:10] <nucco> bnjmn: technically, the only difference btw the ubuntu "versions" is just the default set of packages :)
[negative] [21:11] <dassouki_> nucco, Arky44 u guys don't happen to know why from gutsy to hardy my sound stopped working :(
[positive] [21:12] <Arky44> prettyricky: more stable, more packages to download, in some cases faster, in general just better :)
[negative] [21:12] <RunKidRun> anyone :(
[positive] [21:13] <MidnightDevil> yo :)
[negative] [21:15] <Stiny> I still need help. I'm being really sad now. :(
[negative] [21:15] <Administrator_> kindofabuzz: nope.. didn't work. I guess it's back to gutsy for now :(
[positive] [21:20] <jharkn> http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com ftw :)
[positive] [21:21] <Skapare> LukeL: so I'm waiting for a DVD to become available (yup, I got a DVD on that old machine :)
[positive] [21:26] <LOGAN> Skapare: yeah well i wait for the release version :)
[negative] [21:27] <trait> ALSA lib simple_none.c:1738:(simple_add1) helem (MIXER,'Headphone Playback Switch',0,2,0) appears twice or more
[positive] [21:28] <FooAtari> yeah i know dystopianray :)
[positive] [21:29] <roffe__> lots of help there :) I want to be root every time I start up ubuntu is it what scizzo said then?
[positive] [21:33] <roffe__> ok.. thanks I'll look into it, as long as I need to type it less often :)
[negative] [21:36] <trait> ALSA lib simple_none.c:1738:(simple_add1) helem (MIXER,'Headphone Playback Switch',0,2,0) appears twice or more
[positive] [21:47] <Stiny> Vlet: I gues Linux isn't for me. Maybe because I can't solve simple problems. :)
[positive] [21:53] <DaaT> slight prob. When booting into hardy, I have no taskbars... any clue? :)
[positive] [22:02] <DaaT> amenado, believe so. It's... 2.24 I think (trying to recall from memory) and new is 2.26, or something. You probably know it better than I do :)
[negative] [22:02] <Nevstah> hey everyone, any reason why i should be getting slow LAN speed since 8.04 upgrade? i get about 800KB/s up / 1MB/s down :(
[positive] [22:04] <pharoh> ceil420: ah.but since i'm still a newbie(one en a half months now) guess i'll stick to 7.10 til i learn more:)
[positive] [22:04] <ceil420> strtok, i can do that easily enough with my Enlightenment window manager :)
[positive] [22:06] <NicDumZ> Hi ! :) Yet another one of these hardy users without _any_ sound since upgrade. Google for vlc error outputs did not help; vlc-plugin-pulse _is_ installed. Any common hardy-sound FAQ / known issues page maybe ?
[positive] [22:07] <DaaT> amenado, yay :)
[negative] [22:08] <Nevstah> any reason why i should be getting slow LAN speed since 8.04 upgrade? i get about 800KB/s up / 1MB/s down :(  or how i can diagnose?
[positive] [22:11] <DaaT> drivetrax, thanks :)
[positive] [22:12] <ToM-x> Still busy here I see :)
[positive] [22:12] <Stormx2>  play (which requires absolutely no other app using the sound card when firefox is started AND when the video plays) I have to restart firefox afterwards to be able to use other sound-producing apps. Help! :)
[positive] [22:12] <hwilde> amenado, no share = no support :)
[negative] [22:13] <MRutter> hi, I'm getting this audio error when running a game called spring: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
[positive] [22:16] <Steve^> joshua__, I hope so! :)   thanks
[positive] [22:16] <brakkvatn> instantsoup: Try choosing the green flower again :)
[positive] [22:18] <nonewmsgs> nickrober: sweet :)
[positive] [22:19] <_ditoa> only got it this afternoon :)
[positive] [22:20] <Zacaa> good evening :)
[negative] [22:20] <_ditoa> although the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 killed it :(
[positive] [22:21] <ToM-x> No problem :)
[positive] [22:21] <ditoa> noodlesgc: switched back to my main account :)
[positive] [22:24] <_manny> Hi all :)
[negative] [22:28] <MRutter> hwilde: those troubleshooting guides don't seem to apply. Spring uses openal, which defaults to using OSS. under 7.10 Spring worked fine, but with 8.04 it only works if its the only audio application running. If another audio application is running I get this error: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
[positive] [22:38] <mark_> dont want them :)
[positive] [22:40] <mark_> i'm such a linux newbie  -  & loving the ride!  what a revelation :)
[positive] [22:45] <alastor666> bonne nuit recycled :)
[negative] [22:46] <ceil420> i think my distro upgrade got frozen :( it's been "Configuring motion" for like 5mins... with no change
[negative] [22:46] <tawt> nibsa1242  :(
[positive] [22:47] <nucco> jburd: start with the one that annoys you first :)
[negative] [22:56] <kst-> might go back to gutsy :(
[positive] [22:58] <nucco> catmistake: or your irc client should be smart enough to highlight stuff addressed to you :)
[positive] [22:59] <nucco> catmistake: you'll get used to it... :) sometimes I hate it too
[positive] [23:01] <nucco> catmistake: downloading right now, at the amazing rate of 1.35KB/s :)
[positive] [23:05] <nucco> catmistake: as you get better with linux, you might find that you can have a separate partition for /home, then when you do a clean install, you don't have to lose all your data :)
[positive] [23:07] <B-rabbit> catmistake, you are as important as everyone else here :) and if u want to talk about something me and everyone else will be more than happy to help u out
[positive] [23:07] <B-rabbit> catmistake, just askaway :)
[positive] [23:08] <carpark> tawt: plugins for firefox? click 'tools'>'add-ons'>'get add-ons' :)
[positive] [23:14] <nucco> catmistake: I understood :)
[positive] [23:17] <Brodwen> Hi all, I've encountered a problem when booting Ubuntu, my screen resolution is unsupported, has anyone got a fix for this? (Sorry if anyone said anything before, it's a bit packed in here :))
[negative] [23:23] <grandpa> hey guys i have a code red o.0! I was upgrading to hardy from gutsy, and then my computer crashed and gnome won't start...how can I finish the installation from the terminal (the update-dist command returns an error :(
[negative] [23:26] <Lyk4n> :(
[negative] [23:29] <mtaylor> hwilde: yup. tried that. no dice :(
[positive] [23:30] <shane2peru> KooperKool: however if upgrade fails, ohh, I'm dead. :)  I'll be shopping for a cdrom. lol
[positive] [23:33] <roffe__> unop: yeah, a very basic one.. pastbin? :)
[positive] [23:36] <szenti> Hmm, this new release [8.04] of Ubuntu is more complete than the previous one. I'm glad I can use it. :)
[positive] [23:37] <roffe__> unop: it claims I'm a spammer :) can I send the install file to you instaed?
[positive] [23:38] <nucco> hwilde: copying a 100G /home partition isn't something I like to do over and over :)
[positive] [23:39] <cronix> i think that it is just a wrong link in the grub config, cause i had ubuntu installed before. but when i use root (hd0,2) ... nothing happens, i need one more command like "boot this shit :)"
[positive] [23:41] <unop> roffe__, well, it can be .. :) but no
[positive] [23:47] <yoni> Fogel1497: I hapy to know that you had :) How can I solve it as well?
[positive] [23:48] <yoni> Fogel1497: thanks a lot!!! :)
[positive] [23:51] <roffe__> unop: If you've given up, I can more than well understand it :)
[positive] [23:58] <nucco> Steve^ the logical partition also counts as part of the 4 maximum :)

[negative] [00:39] <joetheodd> Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
[positive] [00:46] <mneptok> mariorz: if you are recommending aptitude, i think you should read it. :)
[positive] [00:51] <carl> yeh i prefer vi :)
[positive] [00:51] <norbi> Hello, just wanted to stop by and say that I am liking Linux/Ubuntu so far.  First time user, everything so far went smooth.  Had problems with mp3/video/embedded web codecs, but nothing a little googling didn't fix.  Awesome community, keep up the good work.  I am pretty sure if problems show up this place will be of much help.  See you all around :)
[positive] [00:51] <efrancolaporte> Pelo, yeah i know but you guys are the heroes of linux, if it wasn't for you, 99% would give up, the linux community owes you a lot :)

[positive] [02:48] <AlienX> Wolf23, you type that in :)
[positive] [02:49] <nucco> ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better

[positive] [04:39] <TropicalDude> bazhang: how :)? from synaptic?
[positive] [04:46] <seamus7> darkcrab: then logic would dictate you did something which led to its installation .... that you can't remember what that is is beside the point :)
[positive] [04:46] <josh04> bagelong: "sudo ndiswrapper -m", then reboot and see if it works :)
[positive] [04:48] <darkcrab> :) yea, thats why I finally decided to ditch windows, was hoping to leave the security problems behind.
[positive] [04:49] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, If you were being hacked they probably wouldn't change anything noticeable, this is a great answer because it both alleviates your fear that this is a sign of being hacked and makes you more paranoid at the same time :)
[positive] [05:01] <neil_d> jsoftw: Karshin: you can also 'sudo su -' :)

[positive] [05:32] <B166erx> Nikonlappy, make it long then :) i'm at it for 6 hours now..still no answers .
[negative] [05:37] <Nikonlappy> roxygirl: that means since you arent in the US you cant watch those videos.  I have that same problem when trying to watch dr who  from the UK :(

[positive] [09:06] <Dr_willis> IndyGunFreak,  perhaps NOW the  thing will get bugs and security issues fixed. :)
[positive] [09:07] <Dr_willis> toplok,  lots of us are. :)
[positive] [09:07] <arvind_khadri> nick_, well ubuntu uses gnome :)
[positive] [09:08] <Dr_willis> joe_,  nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
[positive] [09:09] <Dr_willis> joe_,  i use both of those. :)
[negative] [09:10] <razel> anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
[positive] [09:11] <newscane> so how do i fix it? :)
[positive] [09:14] <toplok> ferris_, yep, I use five different OS here :)
[positive] [09:17] <Dr_willis> hangthedj,  it just started working. :) its working now for me here..
[positive] [09:19] <Dr_willis> nick_,  you will have to try it and decide for yourself I guess. :)
[positive] [09:26] <Dr_willis> GT,  most likely its a videocard/driver/monitor issue. :) depends on the details.
[positive] [09:29] <rob> :)
[positive] [09:30] <androver> earthcreed: they switched to pulseaudio in 8.04.  Wine, at least, doesn't have a pulseaudio driver working yet so they do some compatibility stuff with OSS.  Not that that helps :)
[negative] [09:30] <timandtom> rothchild: No idea :( In 7.10, it just automatically asked me if I wanted to enable the restricted drivers for the card, so I did. If I use the "Hardware Testing" option in System>Administrator, then it detects what it is, but that doesn't help any. It just tells me it's name
[positive] [09:30] <androver> razel: you might be able to, but i'm gonna sleep soon :)

[positive] [23:18] <CJS3141> amazen720: That's understandable! :) But to get more clues as possible, try as many other CDs as you can to see if it is just a problem with the Vista written disk.

[positive] [23:28] <Bidget> Jordan_U, alright I got it, I'll give the update another try and we'll see what happens this time :)
[positive] [23:39] <Jordan_U> terrestre, Doesn't live up to its name? :)
[positive] [23:42] <djlenoir> ferris, Ubuntu is loading now. Hopefully this will clear up the GRUB error 22 when booting. :)
[positive] [23:42] <Jordan_U> Kasio, No, you should just end up with gnome with an ugly theme and none of the session startup programs started :)
[positive] [23:44] <CJS3141> aphan9: You've got to be more specific--give more details. :)
[negative] [23:44] <GIn> using pulseaudio is really a bad move :(
[positive] [23:45] <androver> Byan: what do you mean "maybe"? :)
[negative] [23:45] <shane2peru> Kasio, hmm, I'm not sure, that is odd, I didn't do any upgrades. :(  sorry.
[positive] [23:45] <Jordan_U> ferris_, If nothing else there is one in bsdgames, but it's an old text based one :)
[negative] [23:45] <Kasio> to the forums :(
[positive] [23:51] <Marshal> don't ask me i'm just browsing this channel :)
[negative] [23:54] <androver> Byan: sorry then, i'm really not sure :(

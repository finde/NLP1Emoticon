[negative] [04:49] <mojo> Pelo: oh, so app must support... ugh.  thought it was a widget thing but i am not a coder :(
[positive] [04:49] <lmosher> malik__: Yeah that definately depends on what type of audio/vido :)
[positive] [04:50] <lmosher> atlantia: yeah envy is not good w/ fiesty for now. I just spend about 3 hours fixing what forcing envy to install on fiesty did to my poor, poor system :)

[negative] [04:55] <seamus7> dtholden: yeah i tried creating two profiles in Networking (manual configuration) .. one for roaming and one for a static ip ... but it doesn't work as expected ... Network Manager seems to work best only with roaming and then of course you get that password prompty :(
[positive] [04:56] <LordLimecat> Leftmost: enjoy your 354 updates :)
[positive] [04:57] <dtholden> seamus7, nope not yet, ill try later, thanks :)

[positive] [05:02] <Abom> pppoe_dude: yes, but when I'm online (with an ethernet cable) my friend's gonna try to fix it via vnc :)
[positive] [05:03] <Abom> pppoe_dude: either that or we'll just make a fing password for it, it'll probably work with just a password hehe, but I'll find out this weekend, thanks for the help too :)
[positive] [05:03] <tom_> witless: np :)

[positive] [05:39] <Jordan_U> nibsa1242_, In Feisty just install bcm43xxfwcutter and it will automatically download and extract it to /lib/firmware for you :)
[positive] [05:49] <Jordan_U> binMonkey, I don't think so ( but I would just use the native broadcom drivers myself :)
[positive] [05:49] <Jordan_U> binMonkey, Yup, and so did dapper and Edgy :)
[positive] [05:52] <Jordan_U> [_miT_] , Sorry :)
[positive] [05:52] <Jimbo99> Pelo: funny.....:)  want to be able to use the accelerated 3d graphics.  Otherwise I'd just put winxp back on it.
[negative] [05:52] <[_miT_] > Jordan_U: no worries, im the newb here :(
[negative] [05:55] <boyko> Dammit, I'm frustrated with Feisty.  Feisty is too good.  Too easy.  I don't get any challenge or sense of accomplishment from it.  I haven't had to go to the command line once! 90 minutes and everything works.  What kind of deal is that?  I didn't even need Automatix.  :(
[positive] [06:00] <jared_> Thanks :) I just ordered me some feisty CDs to try it out
[negative] [06:01] <megafauna> eck: yes, that is my prob. i'll just wait to upgrade then:(((
[positive] [06:03] <koaL> just 80, ok thank :)
[negative] [06:19] <yagami> now whenever i log in, i have about a dozen apps opening. i don't know how to reset it to default :( - which is with an empty session-
[positive] [06:19] <mojo> "ubuntu" filter on freenode chan list returns 143 channels... thats krAzy!!  :)
[positive] [06:25] <KalleDK> Thx sartan motd was just what I was looking for :)
[positive] [06:27] <mojo> edrews: you can replace it yourself right now if you want :)  originally there was a project, luminosity, i think, that was a modified metacity to support composite.  but then dave (methinks) started from scratch on compiz and iirc it uses glitz libraries for the gl stuff, tho i am not authoritive on this stuff
[negative] [06:36] <koaL> i seem to be lost, where is the httpd.conf located :(
[positive] [06:40] <rulus> that's pretty clear, ubunte :)
[negative] [06:48] <whta> rulus: i don't know why it doesn't :(
[positive] [06:48] <neilthereildeil> ohh ok :)
[positive] [06:49] <catxk> Bsims, Flannel: not many so many, pretty basic install... an estimate? :)
[positive] [06:50] <stellaras> :)
[positive] [06:52] <Jordan_U> bucko, Break it :)
[positive] [06:52] <Dr_willis> bucko,  it can do some very bad things. :)
[positive] [06:54] <Jordan_U> stellaras, Yes, you can then :)
[positive] [06:54] <stellaras> thanks :) 7.04 ROCKS
[negative] [06:58] <r0bby_> :(
[positive] [07:04] <K> neilthereildeil: Yeah... enable muntiverse... It shows up just fine here :)

[positive] [07:17] <koaL> Can someone recommend a good ftp server :)
[positive] [07:21] <micahcowan> I suppose I could run fakeroot :)
[positive] [07:25] <Jordan_U> |ringo|, I don't think anybody would object to ubuntuguides ( as long as you check the wiki first :)
[positive] [07:26] <Jimbo99> lol, slackers  :)
[positive] [07:26] <Meshezabeel> fak3r: :)
[positive] [07:33] <Jordan_U> feistyman, I don't :) If you give me a link to one though I can try, I have many different players installed already
[positive] [07:36] <ubotu> nicole: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [07:36] <Jordan_U> ceil420, Be careful, if Gutsy had a candidate you would have just upgraded him to it :)
[negative] [07:43] <vm> just have to get ati drivers working so i can have beryl/compiz :(
[negative] [07:44] <sickofwireless> jordan_u: intel / realtek (one of them... :()
[positive] [07:46] <Jordan_U> yoz, Because vi is like that :) use nano, it is much more intuitive.
[positive] [07:47] <Jordan_U> Keddanonymous, A new version was just released a few days ago, perfect timing :)
[positive] [07:50] <Jordan_U> rickfdez, When it says "install or run Ubuntu" the OR is important :)
[negative] [07:52] <omegabeta> actually, i think /home "is" on another paty.. i just cant bloody remember :(
[positive] [07:54] <EnsignRedshirt> kosnick: I don't think so, but it would be a good idea :)  (That, and, say #ubuntu-wireless, #ubuntu-ati, etc.)
[positive] [07:58] <Jordan_U_> overshard, I like the Feisty boot splash for once :)
[positive] [08:13] <SeveredCross> Decodes a Musepack file. :)
[positive] [08:18] <Ernz> NickGarvey - That just takes me to another workspace with more stuff on it :)
[positive] [08:19] <noiesmo> PurpZeY, good luck :)
[negative] [08:20] <Ernz> NickGarvey - AHA! Thanks - That's the boy. - but why can't I change that shortcut any more? :(
[positive] [08:23] <Ernz> Cotton: Rain is on that setting manager (beryl-manager) under Extras>Water Effects>Rain :)
[positive] [08:29] <noiesmo> Doctor_Nick, np :)
[positive] [08:35] <Pir8> :)
[negative] [08:36] <siimo> no one cares :(
[positive] [08:44] <zbus> cafuego: thanks. Installing vim did the trick. :)
[positive] [08:49] <savvas> gasper: read the help document, it's pretty easy :)
[positive] [09:04] <MoxJet> NickGarvey: yeah I found it, works perfect :)
[positive] [09:04] <NickGarvey> MoxJet: oh good :)
[positive] [09:13] <Jordan_U> Azureday, Sorry, ignore that last comment :)
[positive] [09:16] <Jordan_U> hamp_, Try running democracyplayer in a terminal ( and don't use Automatix again :)
[negative] [09:23] <h1l4nd0r> hi, i can't login into my default session :( it says can't open /etc/profile but it exists
[negative] [09:26] <Jordan_U> cellojoe, You can't :(
[positive] [09:27] <Jerichau> upgrading from a previous version of ubuntu still considered risky? :)
[negative] [09:33] <Lukemob> I am tired. :(
[positive] [09:40] <sickofwireles1> please :)
[positive] [09:41] <aarmenaa> If you're still having trouble after unplugging stuff, try passing acpi=off in the boot loader to the kernel.  ACPI locks up cranky systems too. :)
[negative] [09:43] <Possum> Crazytom, so you reinstalled from scratch? :(
[negative] [09:46] <Tom47> Possum: rocks and hard places unfortunately :(
[positive] [09:47] <pwuertz> sohum: if you "trust" me :)
[positive] [09:55] <Woody_> thank you anyway :) aarmenaa

[positive] [10:02] <MoxJet> Yes thanks Fujitsu :)
[positive] [10:04] <Jordan_U> orbin, No, basically that was the driver telling you you didin't have the firmware it needed, now you do :)

[negative] [10:12] <dorto> last time I went through the documentation, all they said about chipsets, thought I got it right and bought two USB wireless net cards and none of them are working :(
[positive] [10:18] <[miles] > :)
[positive] [10:21] <dorto> fujitsu, i was talking about distributions - windows and gnu/linux as I see them. can't care less if actually the underlying windows kernel and linux have to support the cards :)
[positive] [10:22] <slackern> oops 160gb seeded since last night, wonder how isp's bandwidth looks after this ubuntu release :)
[positive] [10:22] <Jordan_U> freakabcd, I just wanted to be sure that you didn't thik that because the packages were there that you could go back to Edgy after the upgrade :)
[negative] [10:23] <Bouboule> no fix, just embarrassing now :(
[positive] [10:27] <ubotu> underwatercow: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[positive] [12:01] <dmhouse> Huffalump: well, I don't tend to check 'the news' frequently, at least not that which pertains to Ubuntu releases :)
[positive] [12:02] <dmhouse> Huffalump, bgrupe: thanks though, I'll check back in October. :)
[positive] [12:02] <namelessname> fortitUs: fine by me :)
[positive] [12:04] <namelessname> fortitUs: I don't know if iTunes is available for Linux, but I do know that XMMS or Audacious are great players. If you require MP3 support, you should ask Google, there's allot available :)
[positive] [12:13] <namelessname> moDumass: Samba is the solution :)
[negative] [12:15] <fortitUs> aatdark: know anyway to enable it? :(
[positive] [12:15] <namelessname> moDumass: there are allot of guides around :) - Google for 'Samba' and you'll be fine.
[negative] [12:16] <aatdark> Dreamer: ati is always the problem :(

[negative] [01:14] <Paul_UK> how can i map drives with ubuntu?  i can mount them, but no application can seem to see them :(
[positive] [01:17] <jrib> Paul_UK: don't know then, maybe someone else can help, but be sure you mention it's a windows share when you repeat your question in a bit :)

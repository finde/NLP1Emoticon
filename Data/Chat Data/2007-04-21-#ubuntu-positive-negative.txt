[03:24] <bofh80> fenris, oh :) well ok. err i'm not sure :) but at least your using the correct driver now :)
[03:25] <andytayloruk> ok :)
[03:26] <fenris> hm, just "apt-get install beryl" or what? :)
[03:27] <bofh80> hector, what video card do you have? :)
[03:27] <cables> fenris, it wouldn't matter, it would just take a little more time :)
[03:29] <elpargo> cpar2, but it's not the full package :)
[03:30] <elpargo> fenris, yes that happens here too, their generic isn't that great :)
[03:30] <cpar2> :)

[04:28] <TashKavarish> Hess:  thanks for replying, at least i know someone seens this now :)
[04:28] <mojo> :)

[04:32] <dom> just installed 7.04 on my desktop. very happy :)
[04:33] <cables> For some reason, I cannot seed the Feisty torrent :(
[04:38] <ep2011> vox754: Thanks, I already have a 1 GB swap from edgy. :)
[04:49] <mojo> Pelo: oh, so app must support... ugh.  thought it was a widget thing but i am not a coder :(
[04:49] <lmosher> malik__: Yeah that definately depends on what type of audio/vido :)
[04:50] <lmosher> atlantia: yeah envy is not good w/ fiesty for now. I just spend about 3 hours fixing what forcing envy to install on fiesty did to my poor, poor system :)
[04:53] <damian> It doesn't work for me th emiddle button to activate the cube :(
[04:53] <atlantia> lmosher, running now, i'll guinea pig it for ya at least :)
[04:55] <seamus7> dtholden: yeah i tried creating two profiles in Networking (manual configuration) .. one for roaming and one for a static ip ... but it doesn't work as expected ... Network Manager seems to work best only with roaming and then of course you get that password prompty :(
[04:56] <LordLimecat> Leftmost: enjoy your 354 updates :)
[04:57] <dtholden> seamus7, nope not yet, ill try later, thanks :)
[04:57] <fatman2> :)
[04:58] <shigutso> fatman2, nobody asked :)
[05:02] <LordLimecat> its classic bully behavior...stop payin attention, and they stop bullying....worst case, at least youve stopped caring :)
[05:02] <Abom> pppoe_dude: yes, but when I'm online (with an ethernet cable) my friend's gonna try to fix it via vnc :)
[05:03] <Abom> pppoe_dude: either that or we'll just make a fing password for it, it'll probably work with just a password hehe, but I'll find out this weekend, thanks for the help too :)
[05:03] <tom_> witless: np :)
[05:11] <_Codeman_> No one is answering me on #grub :(
[05:12] <stellaras> eck: ate least i thnk so :)
[05:14] <stellaras> eck: thank you i will try again :)
[05:15] <unixforge> Flannel: I tried ubuntu/ubuntu, ubuntu/ , root/root . Nothing works... :(
[05:24] <larson9999> i'll give that subpixel thing a try although i really think it's my eyes :)
[05:26] <Stoffer> eck, yeah, it worked :) thanks
[05:27] <unixforge> Pelo: I tried with no pass. Not working :(
[05:39] <Jordan_U> nibsa1242_, In Feisty just install bcm43xxfwcutter and it will automatically download and extract it to /lib/firmware for you :)
[05:49] <Jordan_U> binMonkey, I don't think so ( but I would just use the native broadcom drivers myself :)
[05:49] <Jordan_U> binMonkey, Yup, and so did dapper and Edgy :)
[05:52] <Jordan_U> [_miT_] , Sorry :)
[05:52] <Jimbo99> Pelo: funny.....:)  want to be able to use the accelerated 3d graphics.  Otherwise I'd just put winxp back on it.
[05:52] <[_miT_] > Jordan_U: no worries, im the newb here :(
[05:55] <boyko> Dammit, I'm frustrated with Feisty.  Feisty is too good.  Too easy.  I don't get any challenge or sense of accomplishment from it.  I haven't had to go to the command line once! 90 minutes and everything works.  What kind of deal is that?  I didn't even need Automatix.  :(
[06:00] <jared_> Thanks :) I just ordered me some feisty CDs to try it out
[06:01] <megafauna> eck: yes, that is my prob. i'll just wait to upgrade then:(((
[06:03] <koaL> just 80, ok thank :)
[06:19] <yagami> now whenever i log in, i have about a dozen apps opening. i don't know how to reset it to default :( - which is with an empty session-
[06:19] <mojo> "ubuntu" filter on freenode chan list returns 143 channels... thats krAzy!!  :)
[06:25] <KalleDK> Thx sartan motd was just what I was looking for :)
[06:27] <mojo> edrews: you can replace it yourself right now if you want :)  originally there was a project, luminosity, i think, that was a modified metacity to support composite.  but then dave (methinks) started from scratch on compiz and iirc it uses glitz libraries for the gl stuff, tho i am not authoritive on this stuff
[06:36] <koaL> i seem to be lost, where is the httpd.conf located :(
[06:40] <rulus> that's pretty clear, ubunte :)
[06:48] <whta> rulus: i don't know why it doesn't :(
[06:48] <neilthereildeil> ohh ok :)
[06:49] <catxk> Bsims, Flannel: not many so many, pretty basic install... an estimate? :)
[06:50] <stellaras> :)
[06:52] <Jordan_U> bucko, Break it :)
[06:52] <Dr_willis> bucko,  it can do some very bad things. :)
[06:54] <Jordan_U> stellaras, Yes, you can then :)
[06:54] <stellaras> thanks :) 7.04 ROCKS
[06:58] <r0bby_> :(
[07:04] <K> neilthereildeil: Yeah... enable muntiverse... It shows up just fine here :)
[07:08] <tom_> go muine :)
[07:12] <KalleDK> Jimbo think i got it :) UUID=theid   /mount/point ext3 defaults 0 0
[07:13] <Jordan_U> fak3r, Generic :)
[07:15] <Cryoniq> wastrel, thank :)
[07:17] <koaL> Can someone recommend a good ftp server :)
[07:21] <micahcowan> I suppose I could run fakeroot :)
[07:25] <Jordan_U> |ringo|, I don't think anybody would object to ubuntuguides ( as long as you check the wiki first :)
[07:26] <Jimbo99> lol, slackers  :)
[07:26] <Meshezabeel> fak3r: :)
[07:33] <Jordan_U> feistyman, I don't :) If you give me a link to one though I can try, I have many different players installed already
[07:36] <ubotu> nicole: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:36] <Jordan_U> ceil420, Be careful, if Gutsy had a candidate you would have just upgraded him to it :)
[07:43] <vm> just have to get ati drivers working so i can have beryl/compiz :(
[07:44] <sickofwireless> jordan_u: intel / realtek (one of them... :()
[07:46] <Jordan_U> yoz, Because vi is like that :) use nano, it is much more intuitive.
[07:47] <Jordan_U> Keddanonymous, A new version was just released a few days ago, perfect timing :)
[07:50] <Jordan_U> rickfdez, When it says "install or run Ubuntu" the OR is important :)
[07:52] <omegabeta> actually, i think /home "is" on another paty.. i just cant bloody remember :(
[07:54] <EnsignRedshirt> kosnick: I don't think so, but it would be a good idea :)  (That, and, say #ubuntu-wireless, #ubuntu-ati, etc.)
[07:58] <Jordan_U_> overshard, I like the Feisty boot splash for once :)
[08:13] <SeveredCross> Decodes a Musepack file. :)
[08:18] <Ernz> NickGarvey - That just takes me to another workspace with more stuff on it :)
[08:19] <noiesmo> PurpZeY, good luck :)
[08:20] <Ernz> NickGarvey - AHA! Thanks - That's the boy. - but why can't I change that shortcut any more? :(
[08:23] <Ernz> Cotton: Rain is on that setting manager (beryl-manager) under Extras>Water Effects>Rain :)
[08:29] <noiesmo> Doctor_Nick, np :)
[08:35] <Pir8> :)
[08:36] <siimo> no one cares :(
[08:44] <zbus> cafuego: thanks. Installing vim did the trick. :)
[08:49] <savvas> gasper: read the help document, it's pretty easy :)
[09:04] <MoxJet> NickGarvey: yeah I found it, works perfect :)
[09:04] <NickGarvey> MoxJet: oh good :)
[09:13] <Jordan_U> Azureday, Sorry, ignore that last comment :)
[09:16] <Jordan_U> hamp_, Try running democracyplayer in a terminal ( and don't use Automatix again :)
[09:23] <h1l4nd0r> hi, i can't login into my default session :( it says can't open /etc/profile but it exists
[09:26] <Jordan_U> cellojoe, You can't :(
[09:27] <Jerichau> upgrading from a previous version of ubuntu still considered risky? :)
[09:33] <Lukemob> I am tired. :(
[09:40] <sickofwireles1> please :)
[09:41] <aarmenaa> If you're still having trouble after unplugging stuff, try passing acpi=off in the boot loader to the kernel.  ACPI locks up cranky systems too. :)
[09:43] <Possum> Crazytom, so you reinstalled from scratch? :(
[09:46] <Tom47> Possum: rocks and hard places unfortunately :(
[09:47] <pwuertz> sohum: if you "trust" me :)
[09:55] <Woody_> thank you anyway :) aarmenaa
[09:55] <MoxJet> Thanks :)
[09:56] <slackern> MoxJet: i'll say htop then just to be different :)
[10:00] <Jack313> :)
[10:02] <MoxJet> Yes thanks Fujitsu :)
[10:04] <Jordan_U> orbin, No, basically that was the driver telling you you didin't have the firmware it needed, now you do :)
[10:06] <Woody_> wickedpuppy: and neither does GAIM :(
[10:09] <Bouboule> :)
[10:10] <slackern> PurpZeY: :)
[10:11] <dorto> jussi01, thanks! I will buy it from amazon :)
[10:12] <dorto> jussi01, :(
[10:12] <dorto> last time I went through the documentation, all they said about chipsets, thought I got it right and bought two USB wireless net cards and none of them are working :(
[10:18] <[miles] > :)
[10:21] <dorto> fujitsu, i was talking about distributions - windows and gnu/linux as I see them. can't care less if actually the underlying windows kernel and linux have to support the cards :)
[10:22] <slackern> oops 160gb seeded since last night, wonder how isp's bandwidth looks after this ubuntu release :)
[10:22] <Jordan_U> freakabcd, I just wanted to be sure that you didn't thik that because the packages were there that you could go back to Edgy after the upgrade :)
[10:23] <Bouboule> no fix, just embarrassing now :(
[10:27] <ubotu> underwatercow: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:28] <p-Lukemob> Please copy/paste. I got disconnected. :(
[10:33] <Fujitsu> underwatercow: It should have :)
[10:56] <ubotu> spankstar-ubuntu: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:10] <fungostar> mjbrooks looking on the ubuntu IRC channel list, this is the most appropriate :(
[11:12] <fungostar> mjbrooks, right.. but for ubuntu specific help, there is nothing else :)
[11:16] <calamari> mjbrooks: yeah.. hehe it doesn't help much does it? :)
[11:18] <dthacker> Liber: we were all new once :)  no you should see a set of info for eth0 and another for l0
[11:20] <calamari> SubMOA: np :)

[11:47] <christine_> Haffalump: thanks :(
[11:50] <Horscht> I want sound :(
[11:54] <yagami> aatdark: lol. linux obviously :)
[11:54] <crdlb> it's that simple :)
[12:01] <dmhouse> Huffalump: well, I don't tend to check 'the news' frequently, at least not that which pertains to Ubuntu releases :)
[12:02] <dmhouse> Huffalump, bgrupe: thanks though, I'll check back in October. :)
[12:02] <namelessname> fortitUs: fine by me :)
[12:04] <namelessname> fortitUs: I don't know if iTunes is available for Linux, but I do know that XMMS or Audacious are great players. If you require MP3 support, you should ask Google, there's allot available :)
[12:13] <namelessname> moDumass: Samba is the solution :)
[12:15] <fortitUs> aatdark: know anyway to enable it? :(
[12:15] <namelessname> moDumass: there are allot of guides around :) - Google for 'Samba' and you'll be fine.
[12:16] <aatdark> Dreamer: ati is always the problem :(
[12:19] <h3x0r_> xq: Thanks :)
[12:23] <askar> xq: hrm ok..cause I had 3d support before I upgraded to feisty and now its gone :(

[12:33] <Heth> aldin, Thanks :)
[12:34] <Heth> aldin, :)
[12:37] <Heth> aldin, thanks a lot :)))
[12:42] <mneptok> mrcreativity: is Xubuntu next? :)
[12:44] <Jerichau> Dave123, cheers :)
[12:51] <Huffalump> peteremc1, it sounds like just a confidence issue for you.  you understand the tool.  trust all the people who say it works great :)
[12:52] <[A] ndy80> I tried to upgrade to feisty from edgy. There was an error wth gmediastreamer-0.12 packages... an error in the installa script... now I've an unstable/hybrid system... I can boot but I cannot upgrade gmediaserver or remove it!!! :(
[12:55] <foxiness> zunbeltz: just make sure to change the default session to gnome :)
[12:57] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:07] <Paul_UK> foxiness:  I have vmware workstation 6 (latest build), and now installing a virtual machine :)  so vm server should work fine :)

[01:11] <kerik> rambo3: true... :)
[01:13] <Ravenheart> first time i use it, its normal for me to be a newb :)
[01:14] <Paul_UK> how can i map drives with ubuntu?  i can mount them, but no application can seem to see them :(
[01:17] <jrib> Paul_UK: don't know then, maybe someone else can help, but be sure you mention it's a windows share when you repeat your question in a bit :)
[01:17] <illJazz> :)
[01:17] <kpel> kerik: not after i upgraded :(
[01:19] <kpel> kerik: tell me about it :) i found where the postinstall script exits but i don't know what's wrong: for some reason the script cannot execute successfuly the "db_version 2.0" line
[01:19] <Ianman> webben: never seen that before :(
[01:22] <LjL> jinzo: paste it anyway :)
[01:26] <jrib> Paul_UK: I believe this user had a similar problem if you would like to read: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=213824 .  Use what works best for you of course :)
[01:28] <nielsm> yeah, it still fails to boot :(  grub loading stage 1.5 "error 17"
[01:28] <ubotu> Erebus: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[01:32] <eztk> there must be someone here who knows how to fix the buggered up kernal problem which leads to feisty leaving my machine unbootable?? "waiting for root file system" -- hangs then drops to busy box :(
[01:33] <eztk> wolfspirit: the lovely upgrade button has killed my system. that's why im here :(
[01:34] <alvaro> Azureday, i already have flash installed but i need shockwave and did not find it :(

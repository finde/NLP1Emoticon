[positive] [06:44] <DanTheMan25> madpilot thanks :)
[positive] [06:50] <anjin_> DB0 - Ok, so how do I resolve it?  (I hate being a newb again!) :)
[positive] [06:53] <dli> DJ_Danni, I speak broken english too :)
[negative] [06:55] <anjin_> Ok, I'm gonna try logging out and back in again... but it probably won't work.  Ah well... looks like I'm stuck burning in XP instead :(

[negative] [07:22] <cackette> arg, another error :(
[positive] [07:30] <nanotube> sakka, since you asked where you can post output of your iwconfig, i directed you to use the pastebin :)
[positive] [07:31] <dli> sakka, try static IP :)
[positive] [07:31] <nanotube> sakka, no prob :)
[positive] [07:32] <nanotube> h6w, hmm, seems like something you should google for. :)
[positive] [07:37] <anjin_> Just in case that info can actually help somebody with the same problem in the future :)
[positive] [07:44] <dli> rredd4, could be, I have no experience with it then :)
[positive] [07:46] <nanotube> Thlayli, about 700 people :)
[negative] [07:47] <Thlayli> today i wanted to install ethereal, and recognized the port is broken :(
[positive] [07:48] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, throw out your questions, and we will see :)
[positive] [07:49] <Thlayli> i love my fluxbox :)
[positive] [07:50] <nanotube> Thlayli, well, good thing that default ubuntu desktop is gnome, not KDE, then, ain't it? :)
[negative] [07:50] <Thlayli> you know, xorg 7.0 was developed for linux only :(
[positive] [07:54] <Thlayli> thanks for your answers. i think i'll get me an iso now and try it out :)
[negative] [07:58] <dli> sakka, hard, if you don't know how to upgrade your kernel :( try bcm43.sf.net
[positive] [08:00] <Thlayli> k :)
[positive] [08:01] <Madpilot> Thlayli, cool - welcome to Ubuntu :)
[positive] [08:15] <amphi> DBO: it would seem not... :)
[positive] [08:21] <bimberi> lewion: yw :)
[positive] [08:23] <bimberi> VR_: yw :) - yeah server install, change repos, dist-upgrade, install ubuntu-desktop    (worth a go i reckon)
[positive] [08:37] <bimberi> scottt106: i'm not sure that a symlink is the right solution (not avoiding answering) :)
[positive] [08:47] <bimberi> scottt106: yay, np :)
[positive] [08:58] <freakabcd> cool, you're good to go then :)

[positive] [09:39] <aftertaf> :)
[positive] [09:43] <aftertaf> ubuntu, reboot :)
[positive] [09:48] <kuja> amphi: He's a little slow on the responsive side, but I'm asking him :)
[positive] [10:00] <kuja> amphi: No, the /etc/hosts :)
[negative] [10:00] <kuja> :(
[positive] [10:16] <ompaul> ubuntu, I don't resemble that remark :)
[negative] [10:18] <kuja> Flannel: Modified /etc/hosts but still getting that error :(
[positive] [10:21] <RandolphCarter> you can do some clever stuff, like pinging a host to check what network you're on :)
[negative] [10:27] <B1zz> yeap :(
[positive] [10:40] <Senilix> flaccid: just google on "ubuntu vs debian" :)
[positive] [10:48] <ringe> Knelix: I am. :) It's not my Windows. Customers.
[positive] [11:11] <T`> gotcha.. lemme do it :)
[positive] [11:15] <Ng> T`: that sounds like you're running the 32bit version then :)
[positive] [11:16] <Ng> eatingtheproverb: ask your question and find out :)
[positive] [11:16] <Mika_i_> :)
[positive] [11:16] <T`> Ng, no i686.. lol :)

[positive] [11:19] <Ng> you want to reset your boot drive? meaning what? :)
[positive] [11:19] <Ng> T`: blackdown sucks, use sun's java :)
[positive] [11:21] <spikeb> given the pain in the ass of using 64 bit linux, it ought to be fairly relevant :)
[positive] [11:42] <selinium_> doubler: gcc is there :)
[negative] [11:43] <doubler> :(
[positive] [11:48] <Ng> pepsi: so leave it running :)
[positive] [11:50] <pepsi> hehe.. FF takes like 15 seconds to start on my laptop :)

[positive] [12:23] <jirwin> got it :)
[positive] [12:23] <Ng> Thlayli: yeah, you want to be using dapper to try xgl really, but it's out very very soon :)
[positive] [12:24] <Ng> spikeb: so you think, others think otherwise. this is a support channel, #ubuntu-offtopic is for opinions/rantings/whatever :)
[positive] [12:24] <Ng> B1zz: google :)
[positive] [12:24] <Ng> spikeb: well then :)
[positive] [12:34] <Nameeater> yea reading that now :)

[positive] [12:46] <Ng> ubuntu: this isn't a sarge support channel, we're here to support the ubuntu distro :)
[positive] [12:52] <Ng> ubuntu: well it looked to me like you had just typed it wrong. use tab completion :)
[positive] [01:03] <Ng> neck_: I barely use IM, sorry :)

[positive] [04:06] <tristanmike> :)
[positive] [04:08] <slackern> LoRe: but they recommend using pam for that and i have no idea about how that works :)
[negative] [04:09] <gnomefreak> senjin: i said pastebin :(
[positive] [04:19] <mnk> but workstation is expensive :)
[positive] [04:22] <tristanmike> tubbie, please use "/msg ubotu <factoid>" to get personal facts from ubotu so the channel doesn't get messy :)
[positive] [04:23] <tubbie> ok :)
[positive] [04:36] <Ng> hey jono :)
[positive] [05:03] <Samuli^> hello there shutdown :)
[positive] [05:18] <rapha> Hey ahoward :)
[positive] [05:20] <rapha> Thx ahoward :)
[positive] [05:21] <rapha> Yes I think that's the app ahoward! Thx! :)
[positive] [05:22] <slackern> mpd is nice for big collections :)
[positive] [05:23] <rapha> ahoward: I tried various keywords, like "cd ripper" or "cd player", but the list was always too long. And when I just searched for "Name", it didn't appear. That's why I finally came here then :)
[positive] [05:34] <melon_> ubotu: hibernation should just work :) if Dapper is supposed to be leading desktop OS
[positive] [05:36] <Nailor> Raskall: Put up a company of your own. :)
[positive] [05:40] <Raskall> Nailor: then they use an old desktop machine. :) sufficient for quite an amount of users
[positive] [05:43] <Raskall> (for an hourly rate :)
[positive] [05:45] <Healot> i'll pick up a baseball bat :)
[positive] [05:45] <Nailor> Raskall: Yeah, that's true. Starting your own business is a thing you propably want to do while you're woking in a company that pays you a salary :)
[positive] [05:45] <Raskall> Nailor: cool. :) Any tips for selling points for customers? Other than saving a microsoft server license?
[positive] [05:46] <Raskall> Nailor: :)
[negative] [05:47] <Raskall> Nailor: :(
[negative] [06:12] <blaze> i want someone to help me install my video drivers for ubuntu, because i've asked 3-4 times and nobody helped me :(
[positive] [06:17] <Healot> blaze: you can't in GNU/linux unfortunately, no WMP :)
[positive] [06:19] <r0xoR> :)
[positive] [06:19] <Falstius> oprime: I see your problem.. you need to edit your sources.list and remove the "." before archives :)
[positive] [06:19] <blaze> so.. let me see :) sec.
[positive] [06:20] <blaze> :) ok
[positive] [06:21] <Falstius> oprime: that's because you have a ".archive" instead of "archive" .. the . makes the file hidden :)
[positive] [06:21] <r0xoR> blaze, the xvid codec :)
[positive] [06:22] <blaze> and it's kind of perfect :)
[positive] [06:27] <blaze> r0xoR, never :)
[positive] [06:28] <blaze> i can't apply the driver :)
[positive] [06:29] <blaze> huh :)
[positive] [06:30] <blaze> ok :)
[positive] [06:30] <blaze> :) ok, cool
[negative] [06:31] <gnomefreak> something didnt turn out right :(
[positive] [06:33] <r0xoR> blaze, that's easy... read the instructions :)
[positive] [06:34] <blaze> super :) thank you very much
[positive] [06:34] <blaze> thank you! :)
[positive] [06:34] <blaze> ok :) wish me luck :D

[positive] [06:35] <blaze> ok :) 10x :D
[positive] [06:36] <blaze> ok, cool :)
[positive] [06:36] <blaze> ok :)
[positive] [06:40] <Falstius> oprime: I figured you deleted it :)  Glad its working.
[positive] [06:43] <Dr_Willis> get some milk and bread while you are out. :)
[negative] [06:43] <aaron> dapper is cancelled :(
[positive] [06:44] <blaze> so how much that makes :) ?
[positive] [06:45] <bthornton> lullabud: hm, okay.  In reality, I would like all hosts to be able to communicate with e/o as though they were on the same subnet, so that begs the question... ya the question you just asked :)
[positive] [06:48] <sharms> or 0-254 rather :)_
[positive] [06:49] <Howdy125> Nice not seeing "Beta" on my desktop anymore .. :)
[positive] [06:50] <blaze> i'm a newbie after all :)

[positive] [07:16] <blaze> but it won't close, what else can i do to close it :) ? i've tried killall "firefox" (without "")
[positive] [07:17] <blaze> oh.. xkill is fine :)
[positive] [07:25] <Falstius> oops :)
[positive] [07:27] <Falstius> FeestBijtje: then mount it read-write :)
[positive] [07:31] <Warbo> L33TrDaNu: Oh, sorry I thought you meant a flash based (NAND memory) usb MP3 Player :)
[positive] [07:33] <Tomcat_> Falstius: Should be okay. :)
[positive] [07:35] <LinuxJones> mjcs, like I said if he's feeling brave :)
[positive] [07:39] <Warbo> jhenn: Oh right. Well, the only solution I have for lagging/sticking windows when moving is XGL, but I doubt that would help :)
[positive] [07:54] <CoOlGhOsT> :)
[positive] [07:57] <cubikdice> Warbo, this shouldnt take long :)
[positive] [08:04] <Warbo> mirak: I noticed that XChat crashes when it starts. I started using GAIM :)

[positive] [09:12] <Falstius> I'm running dapper now .. when they release it as stable, I'll destabalize it by installing XGL :)
[positive] [09:12] <Warbo> What do people think of apt-plus.com? It makes me shudder :)
[positive] [09:21] <Mortal`> I'll try again :), is there a hotkey to change workspaces like Alt+tab?
[positive] [09:30] <jorgg> Warbo: ah.. finally fixed it! :) had to set aoss as the wrapper for dsp in firefox, and install alsa-oss. Now it works :)
[positive] [09:40] <Warbo> I type advice here, but I can't get port forwarding to work on my router :)
[positive] [09:59] <Warbo> Well I am going to install the latest kernel in Dapper and rebuild my CD, wish me luck :)

[positive] [04:33] <JB318> I'm liking amaroK based on the screenshots... There's a "party mode" that, whatever it is, has to be cool :)

[positive] [04:51] <nickrud> sakka, I don't know that one, but I have seen people get help here when the right person is about. Ask about every ten minutes or so :)
[positive] [04:53] <lastnode> Ademan: :) welcome to testing
[positive] [04:57] <nickrud> Junichi, erm. sorry that came off flippant. Actually, I don't want to spend my time on learning how to bood from a cd image on the hd :)

[positive] [06:04] <leojstewart> Managu: I just fixed the problem.  I'm a linux-newbie and realized it would be sda1 not hda1... my mistake.  Sorry for wasting your time, and thanks for the help. :)
[negative] [06:07] <slackern> heres a sample from the logs. May 24 05:36 : problems opening audio device while playing "little_smelly_monkey.mp3"ALSA lib confmisc.c:672:(snd_func_card_driver) cannot find card '0'
[positive] [06:13] <Madpilot> Pyru, welcome to Ubuntu, then. I'm afraid I'm going to inflict a !tell on you, though :)
[positive] [06:13] <dusanyu> Pyru Welcome to sanity (atleast security :) )
[positive] [06:18] <nickrud> java-package may end up being history :)
[positive] [06:20] <slackern> crimsun: hmm mpd is usually started with 'sudo /etc/init.d/mpd start' so i guess i'll have to figure out how to do that on a commandline and another problem it won't start giving the error until i connect with a client which tells it to start playing :)
[negative] [06:38] <Corey> jackson: im not sure its a game called Artifact it installed alright then it wont load in terminal :(
[positive] [06:42] <Corey> My freind is making a windows emulator :)

[negative] [07:16] <phrowzen> IcemanV9, i would like to try it to be honest, i mean im sure i could get it to work, but i dont think i would reach the full functionality as i would in windows, by installing it i thought i would only be doing it out of curiousity.. and i dont have enough time to reconfigure everything :(
[positive] [07:28] <Corey> nearly done downloading ET :)
[positive] [07:33] <Hexidigital> paradizelost::  i hope :)  thanks for your help!

[positive] [08:10] <mustard5> ubuntu, you are dreaming of window? :)
[positive] [08:15] <mustard5> Taru, you could just open a command line text editor and do this :)
[positive] [08:24] <Hexidigital> paradizelost:: yeah, but you explain so people can actually understand:)
[positive] [08:25] <Hexidigital> :)
[positive] [08:26] <bur[n] er> Pyru: i'll find the process to kill for ya... one sec :)

[positive] [10:50] <l1lk1ll> Thank you Healot :)
[positive] [10:52] <dli> Ryuujin, try gentoo-fbsd :)
[positive] [10:55] <Ng> Insup: upgrading should indeed be pretty easy, but a fresh install is always nicer imho. It's entirely up to you though. Create a separate partition for /home/ and you can install the new version next week with little or no pain :)
[positive] [10:56] <l1lk1ll> Ng, You seem like the guy I need to be talking to :)
[positive] [10:56] <l1lk1ll> I'm confused, I can't even install this xchat client. :)
[positive] [10:56] <Ng> dli: you don't need sudo to apt-cache search :)
[negative] [10:57] <dli> Ng, I don't know :( because I always use root, while some smart asses want to keep using root as a top secret
[positive] [11:00] <noiesmo> dli, ok :)
[positive] [11:02] <Arnia> Ok, apologies... need to put my glasses on :)
[negative] [11:03] <B1zz> sadley no i think misplaced.... :(

[positive] [11:32] <B1zz> umm idk :) better safe than sorry?
[positive] [11:36] <dli> xxyyzz, stop X :)
[positive] [11:36] <zcat[1] > damn small linux will run fine in 64M of ram.. :)
[positive] [11:37] <Corey> alright lets see if it works this time :)
[positive] [11:41] <Corey> ompaul: dont worry got t isntalled :)
[positive] [11:49] <Corey> it will be worth the work photoshop on linux :)

[positive] [12:10] <Ng> Bilford: completely :)
[negative] [12:37] <dli> spacey, it's not a tech problem :(
[positive] [12:42] <l1lk1ll> This is all so easy :)
[positive] [12:43] <tubbie> yes it is :)
[positive] [12:43] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, feel free to ask your questions here :)
[positive] [12:44] <l1lk1ll> Tubbie, I love you :)
[positive] [12:51] <l1lk1ll> oh ok I read the wrong section, sorry again :)
[positive] [12:53] <l1lk1ll> This is funny, the site is saying that flash support only for AMD64 and PPC when I installed the non-AMD64 for the specific reason that my friend said AMD64 version couldnt do flash :)
[positive] [01:03] <tubbie> l1lk1ll, :)
[positive] [01:05] <l1lk1ll> so, I am going to try :)
[positive] [01:05] <dli> l1lk1ll, you can run your ubuntu desktop for one month without a reboot :)
[positive] [01:05] <tubbie> mine is fx5200 :)
[positive] [01:07] <PuGz> dli: silly me :)
[negative] [01:08] <dli> l1lk1ll, don't try it :( it's for alpha testing only
[positive] [01:09] <MiniJames> :)
[negative] [01:11] <l1lk1ll> :(
[negative] [01:12] <dli> sangenfant, X should be easy nowadays :(
[negative] [01:29] <dli> PuGz, acx100 is not in stable kernel :(
[negative] [01:30] <dli> Corey, don't repeat :( heard
[negative] [01:32] <dli> PuGz, hard time then :( you may have to read bugs/mailing list at acx100.sf.net
[negative] [01:41] <dli> saquib, I don't know :( you may try googling " linux games "
[positive] [01:42] <slackern> _mason: or what dli said :)
[positive] [01:44] <dli> saquib, if you have a good 3D card, and good cpu, flightgear should run :)
[positive] [01:46] <blaze> hello :) can anyone tell me how to read away messages in Gaim, that are in Cyrillic
[positive] [01:59] <we2by> l1lk1ll, sory :)
[positive] [02:00] <dli> PuGz, I would spend $20 to get one card with linux driver :)
[positive] [02:24] <borfast> ompaul: oh :) yeah, they're pretty horrific... :\
[positive] [02:25] <borfast> linux_galore: oh, ok, you were making start to question my sanity :)
[positive] [02:30] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[positive] [02:34] <ompaul> RichiH, learning more and more about less and less, eventually I will know everything about nothing :)
[negative] [02:38] <zizie> :((
[negative] [02:41] <zizie> Ng : yes that correct but in bad situation this box will use by other person :((
[negative] [02:50] <gnomefreak> DBO: :( yeah it should
[positive] [02:53] <bluetooth_azimut> :)
[positive] [03:05] <eggzeck> But I would like to know what he meant by that :)
[negative] [03:08] <gnomefreak> i didnt :(
[negative] [03:08] <zizie> alfredn : that is  my prob :((
[negative] [03:24] <gnomefreak> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ <<normal :(
[negative] [03:24] <gnomefreak> CarlFK: dont ask :(
[negative] [03:26] <gnomefreak> ok thats not normal :(
[positive] [03:37] <jani_> zeelot, apt gets the software from the repositories :) ... just do apt-get or run synaptic if you want a graphical one
[positive] [03:41] <jani_> zeelot, it is :)
[positive] [03:52] <Ng> Corey: man sudo :)
[positive] [03:57] <Ng> discussions about desktop preferences in #ubuntu-offtopic please :)
[positive] [04:01] <Ng> the javadebs factoid tells you to install 1.4, which is blackdown, and sucks. Install the Sun one from the RestrictedFormats page :)
[positive] [04:02] <Ng> read what I just said about the javadebs factoid :)
[positive] [04:15] <Ng> zeelot: :)
[positive] [04:16] <Ng> we try :)
[positive] [04:18] <njan> Ng, sure - but messing around with .bash_history is just as hard as just setting up rootsh, and rootsh actually is half-way secure. At least compared to .bash_history :)
[positive] [04:19] <Ng> Corey: any time someone tells you to install some package or other, we mean use synaptic or apt-get :)
[positive] [04:37] <Frogzoo> anil: it will if you setup pon properly :)
[positive] [04:44] <topyli> azimuth: well you do have to reboot :)
[positive] [04:45] <azimuth> :)
[positive] [04:48] <topyli> java must die :)
[positive] [04:52] <azimuth> i didn't ask if, I asked when :))
[positive] [04:53] <topyli> anil: look around at gnome-look.org, maybe some crazy soul has made one :)
[positive] [04:57] <kOpter> Corey: Also google for wine :)
[positive] [04:58] <azimuth> :)
[positive] [04:58] <kOpter> Corey: Well.. and of story then :)
[positive] [04:58] <tijn_> just calles isp helpdesk :)
[positive] [05:00] <topyli> kOpter: you don't need to emulate it, you need to rewrite it :)
[positive] [05:03] <topyli> :)
[positive] [05:05] <kOpter> krang: If you don't know what you're doing.. to go messing with your root account :)
[positive] [05:05] <kOpter> krang: Or be prepared to reinstall :)
[positive] [05:07] <kOpter> krang: true :)
[positive] [05:16] <Ng> anil: search the repositories and find out :)
[positive] [05:17] <Ng> r0xoR: that's libcurl, curl is a tool that uses libcurl :)
[negative] [05:19] <Corey> Frogzoo: not working :(
[positive] [05:29] <topyli> yeah it will run just fine but something has to boot it :)
[positive] [05:35] <icheyne> :)
[positive] [05:35] <apokryphos> see #xubuntu for others using it :)

[negative] [04:00] <Hexidigital_> :(
[positive] [04:35] <blackocellaris> My objective is to listen to mp3s, it says I have no audio decoder so that's what I'm after :)

[positive] [05:04] <Hexidigital_> :)
[positive] [05:07] <LeoDK> sorry, :) i'll go to BR ubuntu
[positive] [05:14] <intelikey> voraistos dd if=/dev/zero of=file.img count=2880 && mkfs.vfat file.img && mount file.img /mount/point  cp files to /mount/point   you then have your files in a disk image you could dd to floppy   :)
[positive] [05:15] <blackocellaris> Dont be sorry, I appreciate the effort.  I'm still very new so I'm trying to learn along :)
[positive] [05:16] <Healot> the operation option after the apt-get :)
[positive] [05:16] <Healot> CLOSE it :)
[positive] [05:17] <Healot> then "sudo apt-get install xmms" :)
[positive] [05:18] <intelikey> :)
[positive] [05:21] <intelikey> voraistos as a beginner may i sujest some very good reading for the "unborn child"  :)
[positive] [05:27] <intelikey> voraistos i didn't intend for you to just cp/paste that line... :)   the mount command would look like.    " sudo mount -o loop file.img /mount/point "   where file.img  and mount/point  are an example.   mount/point must be a dir.
[positive] [05:42] <intelikey> :)
[positive] [05:54] <Dr_Willis> bk,  i imagine everyone does :)

[positive] [10:34] <chimai> 'lo :)
[negative] [10:37] <Hexidigital_> egad insists on using ndis.... :(
[positive] [10:38] <Ng> ah :)

[positive] [10:47] <ikor> deadcat: actually you can install cron from cygwin :)

[positive] [11:02] <Unenvarjo> good morning :)
[positive] [11:14] <Ng> H080J03: after you've installed properly, come back here and ask about getting the nvidia drivers installed, should help things :)
[positive] [11:28] <liquidindian> nhaines, I hope I can come across as some techie wizard if it works :)
[positive] [11:30] <thoreauputic> :)
[positive] [11:34] <dli> petrik, there's no such obivious "best" :)
[positive] [11:37] <nhaines> klerfayt, the best thing then to do is to check the forums for the XGl repository someone made.  :)
[positive] [11:40] <nhaines> javiolo, I'm glad you like it.  :)
[positive] [11:46] <nhaines> Ja, wir sind online.  :)
[positive] [11:47] <tubbie> H080J03, :)
[positive] [11:47] <nhaines> Would be best.  :)
[positive] [11:48] <tubbie> oh, :)
[positive] [12:00] <nhaines> Auckland_Pig, yes, until you later disable it.  You don't even have to reboot after you install ssh.  :)
[positive] [12:00] <Auckland_Pig> nhaines: thanks :)
[positive] [12:06] <tubbie> :)
[positive] [12:09] <zcat[1] > yeah, and entirely predictable.. anyone taking bets on when it will actually be out? I guess all the people who predicted mid 2004 had better pay up already :)
[positive] [12:10] <GnarusLeo> ok, sweet, thanks nhaines  :)
[positive] [12:11] <nhaines> You're welcome.  :)  Also, just downloading the CD and putting it in your computer the first time while Kubuntu is running should make it ask if you want to upgrade.  :)  But using the update tool should be better--they wrote a program specially for upgrading.
[positive] [12:12] <marlijs> nano. there is only one way to find out :), if something goes wrong - you van comment it out
[positive] [12:12] <_nano_> marlijs, right on :) ..trying that out :D
[positive] [12:15] <GnarusLeo> ah :) Thanks
[positive] [12:19] <nhaines> petrik, if your name is on a line, it's red, that's all.  :)

[positive] [12:56] <stian> nickrud: I write fast as possible into sources.list almost finish :)
[positive] [01:01] <Terminus> DJ_Danni: here's a tip, always mention the name of the person you're talking to so that they'll know it's for them. especially useful if irc clients to highlighting. :)
[negative] [01:03] <Where> paradizelost: in the OO.org print dialog, there isn't such an option :(
[positive] [01:04] <nickrud> Kyral, heh. Except his sources didn't see kubuntu-desktop :)

[negative] [03:56] <dli> smeacterne, but I am quite an idiot with how a business runs :(
[positive] [03:57] <HymnToLife> roostishaw> yes, and since you need access to it al the time, you'll have it mounted all the time :)
[positive] [03:57] <nickrud_> Inazad, then have fun. It's linux :)
[positive] [03:58] <orbin> Inazad: it lasts 5 seconds :)  then you have usplash to look at

[positive] [04:26] <qatsi> paradizelost: thank you :)
[positive] [04:49] <ubotu> If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
[positive] [04:49] <nickrud_> probably no answer here :)
[positive] [04:53] <nickrud_> Gr3ml1n, gentoo is the nightmare part :)

[positive] [05:22] <nickrud_> that's a decent factoid. bimberi did you clean wine :)
[positive] [05:23] <bimberi> nickrud_: yes, thanks :) although the wikipage it points to has some interesting wine repos on it
[positive] [05:24] <nickrud_> bimberi, I know little about wine, I need a place to leave people :)
[positive] [05:24] <bimberi> nickrud_: lol kk :)
[positive] [05:44] <nickrud_> bimberi, yeah that's good :)
[positive] [05:45] <bimberi> nickrud_: :)
[positive] [05:56] <bintrue> thanks :)
[positive] [06:03] <nickrud_> not bad :)
[positive] [06:05] <Healot> bintrue: windows application are not free. hard to make a repos out of it :)
[positive] [06:07] <nickrud_> bintrue, heh. I spent about a year getting to the point I felt comfortable with that :)
[positive] [06:09] <nickrud_> it's easy, trust us :)
[positive] [06:15] <nickrud_> erm, well 192.168.0.1 :)
[positive] [06:48] <nickrud_> Madpilot, things move fast underfoot :)
[positive] [06:58] <nickrud_> ReleaseX, helping people get their drivers installed, not troubleshooting the drivers: that's here :)
[positive] [06:59] <spikeb> and there is an ubuntu package :)
[positive] [07:05] <nickrud_> kameron, it's not native to ubuntu yet afaict , but you're asking someone who probably knows how :)
[positive] [07:06] <spikeb> wine hasn't been alpha nearly as long as windows :)
[positive] [07:12] <nickrud_> :)
[positive] [07:12] <spikeb> babo: i thought you wanted to run a server :)
[positive] [07:31] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, they have been flakey often :)
[positive] [07:44] <spikeb> KeithWeisshar: that's a good idea :)
[positive] [07:44] <nickrud_> KeithWeisshar, you can copy for just about anyone then :)
[positive] [07:48] <EcoBlue> I figured out why I couldn't get the dpkg command to work: I didn't use terminal. :)
[negative] [07:49] <spikeb> Madpilot: i keep getting rejected by the tracker :(
[positive] [07:54] <nickrud_> spikeb, I cruised past that, my bad :)
[positive] [07:54] <spikeb> hehe nickrud_ :)
[positive] [07:55] <nickrud_> spikeb, ah, thanks :)
[negative] [08:08] <EcoBlue> :(
[positive] [08:12] <nickrud_> I've probably just been typing longer :)
[positive] [08:43] <Healot> my only suggestion is to buy a book on general overview of Linux, like Linux for Dummies :)
[positive] [08:52] <knanand> Please tell me what is the alternate to Kontact in GNOME... (mail, feed, calender, to-do...) :)
[positive] [09:05] <Terminus> laughlin: it's different, but it's just as good. :)
[positive] [09:07] <drumline> distance: probably not, but there's always a chance if you tend to screw things up  :)
[positive] [09:13] <Terminus> laughlin: totem-xine seems to work ok too. :)
[positive] [09:15] <drumline> distance: it is.  :)
[positive] [09:17] <Charredheart> 7.7 megs probably won't be large enough :)
[positive] [09:17] <apokryphos> Ratzilla: it will install the recommended kubuntu desktop, and won't touch any gnome stuff. They can happily exist together :)
[positive] [09:17] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: thanks :) ill install it
[positive] [09:20] <Ratzilla> apokryphos: thanks very much :)

[positive] [09:37] <Corey> I got flash 8.5 working :)
[positive] [09:39] <Terminus> apokryphos: KDE: 3.5.2 :)
[positive] [09:45] <Terminus> kuja: since i was young, coding close to the metal has always interested me. heck, i made a parallel port interface back when i was in high school. :)
[positive] [09:45] <kuja> Well, if asm turns you on, no problem :)
[positive] [09:46] <kuja> :)
[positive] [09:54] <apokryphos> rendi: also, please don't repeat/flood. Everyone sees the question; if there's someone able/willing to help, they will :)

[positive] [10:24] <spikeb> dapper is RC now, not beta. :)
[positive] [10:24] <drumline> dewbie: seriously...  :)  There are jewels in the man pages...   and you don't need to read the whole thing if you don't want to.
[positive] [10:27] <Healot> dewbie, just read the readme text :)

[positive] [11:33] <Terminus> dewbie: well, just trying to be helpful. i don't exactly keep my irc window open and a lot of people don't either. we just wait for the icon to blink. :)
[positive] [11:34] <Terminus> Taru: you don't need partitionmagic if you limit the size of the windows partition when installing it. :)
[positive] [11:37] <spikeb> Kakurady: try it :)
[positive] [11:40] <spikeb> :)
[positive] [11:42] <Terminus> dewbie: you can still use su - without a root password if you really want to. :)
[positive] [11:43] <apokryphos> dewbie: #ubuntu-offtopic for general chatter, please :)
[positive] [11:45] <Mortal`> Kakurady, hehe, sure, I thought of doing that if I couldn't find another way :)
[negative] [11:46] <dewbie> :(

[negative] [01:56] <gnomefreak> its still early here :(
[positive] [01:59] <neck_> that would be really interesting :)
[positive] [02:00] <kholerabbi> No, but I would like to understand some of how its done :)

[negative] [02:03] <Jude> But then I'll loose my uptime! :( (What uptime? :D)
[positive] [02:04] <Jude> I have every intention of just formatting a spare PC and installing dapper on that, so I guess I'll wait until then :)
[positive] [02:04] <arcade> Draconicus: Of course. :)
[positive] [02:09] <arcade> ompaul: Definately a 'nope' then. :)

[positive] [08:14] <papillon> Subhuman: Yeah! :)
[positive] [08:21] <captine> mehmet: not sure.  i only have internet connectivity when in windows, so can't really check these things :)
[positive] [08:42] <arcade> Hm, how do I enable ip-masquerading / NAT when using Ubuntu as a router/firewall :)  internet-connected iface is eth0, the private interface is eth1
[positive] [08:46] <arcade> Anyone?  How to set up ip-masquerading?  I seem to remember "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ip_masquerading", but that file no longer exists.. :)
[positive] [08:48] <arcade> h3sp4wn: Ah, thanks for the hint. :)
[positive] [08:49] <arcade> h3sp4wn: Uhm, yeps, but remember, eth1 has 192.168.0.0/16, while eth0 has a real ip.  the 192.168.0.0/16 is forwarded straight out the default route if i'm only enabling ip_forwarding without also enabling some sort of NATing or masquerading, but I'm no sure how to do that with a 2.6 kernel :)
[positive] [08:50] <arcade> h3sp4wn: Ah, thank you.  You do this with iptables these days? :)
[positive] [08:51] <arcade> h3sp4wn: oh my :)
[positive] [08:52] <arcade> h3sp4wn: in debian 'slink' if I remember correctly :)
[positive] [08:52] <arcade> h3sp4wn: Thanks, works like a charm. :)

[positive] [09:25] <Hexidigital_> paradizelost:: sounds easy enough... :)  ubuntu handles the extra weight better than my previous OS

[positive] [10:28] <jorgg> Sid6000, thanks anyways! :)
[positive] [10:34] <another_lemur> dreamhack:  i think it means bind is not running :)
[positive] [10:44] <nordle> hello, is it simple to upgrade from dapper flight6 to rc?  Do I need to add the rc cd as a repo, or just rely on the already setup net connection?  or do I drop down to cli and dist-upgrade... or none of the above :) Thank you.
[positive] [10:45] <nordle> another_lemur: Thats what I was hoping! :)
[positive] [10:48] <nordle> another_lemur: ok, i'll try it thanks, its a P2-266 so might take a little time :)
[positive] [10:54] <Manika> mathieu: yeah I've just learned that :)
[negative] [11:18] <gnomefreak> ok brb gotta get to eletrical work done :(
[positive] [11:20] <Surfnkid> just got the wlan0 going today :)
[positive] [11:22] <daxxar> Madpilot, didn't seem to have it. :)
[positive] [11:23] <another_lemur> joshdoe, don't hurt yourself by reading that :)
[positive] [11:26] <another_lemur> Blissex, lol, no need to be so negative :)
[positive] [11:27] <another_lemur> +1 madpilot, again :)
[positive] [11:30] <etsme> hi i m back again :) with another quite a complex question. Does anyone know or can guide me in right direction, before displaying the information on Monitor obviously through VGA or GPU whateva hardware, where does the information which is to be displayed on monitor lies ?
[positive] [11:35] <Jowi> kevor: it does :)
[positive] [11:37] <another_lemur> issaker, woohoo!  I need to get back to my vmware install, too :)  let me know if you need more help
[positive] [11:40] <pike__> dubidu: thats all i got :)
[negative] [11:41] <piotrek> chavo, i've install build_essential already :(
[positive] [11:48] <Hexidigital_> biovore:: nice :)
[positive] [11:48] <another_lemur> i can't stand reboot :)
[positive] [11:50] <zcat[1] > h3sp4wn: you do a cold reboot with about a half-hour downtime? A simple reboot isn't going to show up stiction problems :)
[positive] [11:52] <nordle> another_lemur:  wow, root :)  Your a star!  Many thanks.  Just hope my main machine is up to the job, don't want grow old watching john the ripper use 99% of my cpu :)
[positive] [11:52] <zcat[1] > McNutella: somewhere deep in gconf-editor there might be an option for it :)
[positive] [11:52] <another_lemur> nordle, anytime :)
[positive] [11:55] <nordle> another_lemur: Now you understand how I created a system for a non-techy person and did not add a failsafe into it (ie me).....because Im thick! :)  Of course, man my brain is tyred!  I'm going to still leave it running because he sais that I gave him the password, but Im sure(ish) that I looked away and asked him to put one in.... just a bit of pathetic brotherly competition I guess :)
[positive] [11:57] <Jowi> cocox: I wasn't waiting:) iptables is already installed for you. firestarter is a frontend for that (a nice graphical/clickable way to configure it)
[positive] [11:58] <zcat[1] > messju: get a magnifying glass and take a close look.. that's what I did :)
[positive] [11:58] <messju> zcat[1] : hehe, I think my son has got one :)
[negative] [12:00] <messju> this is a thinkpad a30 (1600x1200 @ 15"), pixels should be really small :(

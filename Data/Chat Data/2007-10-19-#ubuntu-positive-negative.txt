[negative] [00:07] <the_darkside_986> i envy all of you? i just want to install and use the gutsy livecd like i would normally always do. i'm not going to settle for text-based installation or any alternate cd's :(
[negative] [00:10] <rayb0t> the tracker is refusing my connection :(
[positive] [00:11] <kst-> is there a way to increase performance in ubuntu gutsy again by switching off Xgl on the fly? I need it for gaming.. best would be without having to re-login :)
[positive] [00:12] <kst-> I think I do, using proprietary ati drivers coz the free ones are much slower :)
[negative] [00:17] <the_darkside_986> if my xorg.conf file is ****'d up again then I will blame k3b or my dvd drive for burning a bad image... :(
[positive] [00:21] <soundray> marx2k_: and X crashes reproducibly under certain conditions. But otherwise - fine :)

[positive] [01:03] <kst> ok soundray... seems this new gui thing is not exactly working well? :)
[negative] [01:04] <|box|> you cant login to desktop as root :(

[positive] [01:21] <PAStheLoD> ZaphodBeeblebrox, about what? :)
[positive] [01:22] <Fryguy--> techjim: hrmm, not related hardware at all :)  I'd imagine it's not hardware/driver related then

[positive] [04:28] <jdong> BeOSMrX: obviously this alternative is extremely hackish and probably not a good idea unless you're trying to earn geek points :)

[positive] [04:53] <Pumpitup> jtt>ahh well guess ill have to wait :)
[positive] [04:53] <Vlet> Or use a torrent! :)
[positive] [04:56] <jtt> Pumpitup, yes one step above the building janitor :)
[positive] [05:00] <jdong> ixian_: just update whenever the update servers aren't dead, at your convenience, and you'll be "final" :)
[positive] [05:01] <Vlet> exhume: maybe they're running an ubuntu mirror and are getting hammered :)
[positive] [05:01] <Vlet> jtt: yeah, I tried the upgrade... things just werem't quite right, so yeah, backup /home and reinstall :)
[positive] [05:04] <Vlet> good idea - for me, anything 'important' is actually on a file server, so if the workstation dies, whatever :)
[positive] [05:05] <Vlet> basic: yeah, it's right there on the download page :)
[positive] [05:06] <Vlet> kurisutofuaa: I think I saw a recipe database in the repos once :)
[positive] [05:10] <Vlet> inigomontoya: I'm no judge :)
[positive] [05:11] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [05:12] <|neon|> lwizardl: is call surround right :)
[positive] [05:13] <PiousMinion> Vlet: thanks.  :)

[negative] [05:16] <b4sic> :(
[positive] [05:17] <Dr_willis> notv,  I THINK it does.. thats what i got on my laptop at least.. but its a rather low end card. so it cant do much 3d wise. :)
[positive] [05:18] <haru> logreeval, i have no ideas then :)
[positive] [05:18] <Dr_willis> Vlet,  Im not sure that works for mount points. :) i find it easier to just make a dir. and chown that.
[positive] [05:19] <Dr_willis> Vlet,  and mounting somthing OVER a directory. makes the permissions on that dir. Ignored. I do belive. :)
[positive] [05:20] <Dr_willis> dredhammer,  i managed to break it. :)
[positive] [05:20] <Dr_willis> Vlet,  its just how mounting things work. :)
[positive] [05:21] <Vlet> thedonvaughn: yeah, completely understood. My mistake :)
[positive] [05:22] <thedonvaughn> Vlet: no worries :)
[positive] [05:25] <Vlet> xTheGoat121x: Keep in mind, that although this place is full of people with problems there are LOTS of ubuntu users who aren't in here with problems :)
[negative] [05:27] <jimmygoon> cellofellow, thanks, and I feel bad for your 5 instances of nm :(
[positive] [05:27] <VeganCheesesteak> liberion: ok all set :)
[positive] [05:28] <Vlet> xTheGoat121x: I would assume so - unfortunately, I'm on a freebsd system at the moment, so I can't check :)
[positive] [05:29] <Vlet> IanLiu: perhaps you could remove your ~/Desktop and replace it with a symlink called Desktop that points to the location of your choice... not sure if that'll work, but worth a try :)
[positive] [05:32] <troxor> IanLiu: open gconf-editor and go to /apps/nautilus/preferences/desktop_is_home_dir :)
[positive] [05:35] <cellofellow> how can I get my video settings back to the defaults (well, the sort-of defaults. I still want to use the restricted driver. :)
[positive] [05:37] <ubotu> Charlotte: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative] [05:41] <Charlotte> :(
[negative] [05:48] <LordLimecat> my mouse runs and hides :(
[negative] [05:51] <gameforge> Well, I have a list of repo mirrors in Adept... I already tried a Canadian one, there aren't any Mexican ones listed - the page IcemanV9 posted has one, and it shows Gutsy, but I have no way to add it. :(
[positive] [05:55] <troxor> dolphinheadedmar: no problemo- enjoy :)
[positive] [05:58] <gameforge> MasterShrek: good point, although it already broke my sources.list once :)
[positive] [06:00] <Dr_willis> i always disable the splash stuff anyway. :)
[positive] [06:01] <troxor> Jordan_U_: hm, weird... those options aren't listed in man synaptic... try killing it, see what happens :)
[positive] [06:02] <gameforge> MasterShrek: yeah, I know, I'm just anxious :) was hoping to get it done by the weekend
[positive] [06:03] <Jordan_U_> haru, Might be easier to install splashy instead :)
[positive] [06:03] <MasterShrek> Evanlec, u should start it compiling tonight and it will be ready in the morning :)
[positive] [06:06] <Jordan_U_> kingnothing, Good, that would mean something was really broken if that happened in Gutsy :)
[positive] [06:08] <troxor> fnadeau: I don't think it was a default, but regardless, I'm not too sure how it gets enabled though :)
[negative] [06:11] <Jordan_U_> wastedfluid, Yes, no idea :(
[positive] [06:12] <MasterShrek> IcemanV9, i like the attitude :)
[positive] [06:13] <dimych> haha, nice :)
[positive] [06:15] <n2diy> Flannel: Jordan_U, I can wait. :)
[positive] [06:16] <IcemanV9> Jordan_U_: i know. thanks. :)
[positive] [06:16] <IcemanV9> Flannel: then i am interested. :)
[positive] [06:19] <Jordan_U_> Pie-rate, with splashy it couldn't be easier, in fact splashy > usplash in every way I can think of :)
[positive] [06:19] <thedonvaughn> MasterShrek: oh i see.  didn't realize /home wasn't on a seperate partition.  But yah in that case i'd go one more step and create another partition and copy /home to it then format over everything.. :)
[positive] [06:21] <troxor> tronyx: sorry :)
[positive] [06:21] <Jordan_U_> Pie-rate, X does not use the frame buffer :)
[positive] [06:22] <Jordan_U_> nkryptd1, !resolution is a command for ubotu :)
[positive] [06:23] <troxor> haru: your best bet is to wait until it becomes available: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/intlclock   if you're impatient, you can check getdeb.net, to see if there's a package available sooner (but be aware these aren't official packages). if you're really impatient, you can scrounge up the source and compile it yourself  :)
[positive] [06:29] <MasterShrek> yea im running gutsy with all my progs just fine :)
[positive] [06:32]  * IcemanV9 used RC iso; not much to update since then. :)
[positive] [06:32] <tuna-fish> nickrud: yeah, i get it, we look so alike :)
[positive] [06:33]  * abhibera is on Gutsy! :)
[positive] [06:44] <Jordan_U_> bluebanana, Upgrading right now will take a looong time since the repos are bogged down :)
[positive] [06:46] <Jordan_U_> bluebanana, System -> Administration -> update manager :)
[positive] [06:47] <MasterShrek> riotkittie, i talked him into it :)
[positive] [06:52] <MasterShrek> Evanlec, sweet, good luck :)
[positive] [06:54] <Jordan_U_> [Ramy], Applications -> Add / Remove :)
[positive] [06:59] <saxi1> MasterShrek: I will :)
[positive] [07:03] <Dr_willis> adminn,  its possible a clean install will work from the start. :)
[positive] [07:06] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [07:08] <Dr_willis> nickrud,  because i treat her like a LADY.... :) for i am The Dr of Love.
[positive] [07:09] <Dr_willis> zerologik,  if you updated recently. No. :)
[positive] [07:09] <Dr_willis> tuntun,  shes a FemBot. :)
[negative] [07:09] <Avariel> yeah ive got 64 bit and java doesnt work :(
[positive] [07:13] <Jordan_U_> adminn, Basically all you should need to do is go to System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager, that's it, click enable and restart and it should work automagically :)

[positive] [16:06] <Vlet> rflmnz: and I can tell you that if you're trying to get compiz working, you're better off finding something else to do :)
[negative] [16:07] <rflmnz> vlet: :(
[positive] [16:08] <Vlet> rflmnz: with all the time you'll spend trying to get it working, you're better off spending that time working a job, taking the money you earn, and buy a $120 NVidia card :)
[negative] [16:15] <SANone> TabooTreez: just discoverd that my HDD died on my notebook :( So I'm not really in the mood to help others any further :(

[positive] [16:47] <shortnick> genii ok ill try that...thanks a lot dude :))))
[positive] [16:47] <zyberzero> MasterShrek: Not really. Found Gnome-Compiz-Manager, I'm sure it will do. Thanks :)

[positive] [17:51] <Dr_willis> nickrud,  thats part of the default options for an entry setting. :) about mid way through
[positive] [17:53] <nickrud> Dr_willis: ah, that's why. I removed them, but didn't document it. Off to do that now :)
[positive] [17:55] <Greencookie> Corp: sorry could u reference the problem? I forgot:)
[positive] [17:57] <Dr_willis> pedro,   why do you think you need it? If you want to use it.. I would suggest a good reading of its homepage/docs.. Its a rather.. complex tool. :)
[positive] [17:59] <Senken12> Gutsy broke my sound. :)
[negative] [17:59] <Senken12> :(
[positive] [18:00] <x938> PovAddict: yes so what stray77 said :)

[positive] [18:02] <YetiChick> PovAddict, Is that a "No, but I just found it..."  :)
[positive] [18:03] <YetiChick> PovAddict, Ah...  Sorry.  I s'pose I could take the time to learn to read.  Nah... :)
[positive] [18:04] <Dr_willis> Noodlesgc,  right now they are as fast as they are going to be. Most Seeders are right NOW. :) in a few weeks they will be much slower.
[positive] [18:08] <fr0nk> beryl on the other hand runs damn smooth :)
[positive] [18:09] <Dr_willis> kiru,  that would be pulling the plug. :)
[positive] [18:10] <DARKGuy> greedo, yeah, but in Gutsy they have included CompizFusion... you just install your video drivers and enable the desktop effects and it'll be working nice and dandy (hopefully... it did on my system anyways). There's fast user switching, better configuration dialogs/panels, a desktop search tool similar to google desktop search, but better and less bloated ;), and lots of other pretty stuff... a nice kernel too :)
[positive] [18:12] <Dr_willis> PovAddict,  last i looked cygwin wasent getting updated any more.. It has more then just an x server. :) xming is a darn good tool :) better then cygwin for the task  (your needs may vary)

[positive] [20:20] <rryan> ganesh : Well, I'm an employee of NVIDIA, so that's why I know nvidia cards reasonably well...   but everything I learned about Linux I learned by doing, and asking questions of people on IRC :) but i've been using linux for a while ...  something like 7 years
[positive] [20:20] <ubotu> DJ_Danni: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[negative] [20:28] <spacenerve> any1 using a m-audio audiophile 2496 usb soundcard? having trouble getn mine to work :(
[positive] [20:30] <Vlet> askand: 6 amp hours is a lot for a watch, but not a lot for a car :)
[positive] [20:31] <Gribok> PriceChild, sorry, my friend just got kicked out, I was just curious if it was a bot or not    :)  didn't mean anything by it
[positive] [20:31] <jdong> Vlet: well technically amp-hours is not sufficient to determine capacity of a battery, but since we're talking about laptops we assume a voltage :)
[positive] [20:32] <jdong> askand: that's a nice battery then :)
[negative] [20:33] <ubuntuchick> i'm having soundcard troubles :(
[positive] [20:33] <Vlet> Everyone, please be aware that that ratio between people asking questions and people answering questions is out of wack right now, so be patient :)
[positive] [20:35] <rryan> Unknown^ : Actually :) if you run make install and it installs it somewhere outside of your home directory (which it usually does) it will need permissions, so you should type 'sudo make install' to let it install itself on your system
[positive] [20:36] <jdong> Ind[y]: same thing :)
[positive] [20:36] <askand>  jdong:  ok..but anyway..time to buy a new one now right? :)
[positive] [20:36] <jdong> askand: it is indeed :)
[positive] [20:36] <ubotu> MiguelAngel: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative] [20:36] <Yarcanox> when trying to start timidity again (as a daemon), I get "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave". it seems like alsa is trashed somehow. this is NOT the first time I experience this. a restart fixed it everytime it happened, but I guess there's a way without a long and disgusting reboot
[positive] [20:38] <rryan> Unknown^ : But then, after that line is done you aren't root anymore :) You can tell because your prompt still has $ instead of #
[positive] [20:38] <Dr_willis> jdong,  or even use the thing? :) gesh...
[negative] [20:38] <Yarcanox> cm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[negative] [20:38] <ubuntuchick> i think im going to give up on ubuntu :(
[positive] [20:39] <ubotu> MiguelAngel: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [20:39] <askand> jdong: Ok..and try to not fully discharge it? Hope my next better will live longer :)
[positive] [20:39] <jdong> Dan2552: you would be running Xgl, which "hides" the ATI driver interfaces :)
[positive] [20:40] <PriceChild> rryan, much appreciated :)
[positive] [20:40] <jdong> Dan2552: DISPLAY in ALL CAPS :)
[negative] [20:43] <Yarcanox> restarting alsa-utils doesn't help, stopping it and timidity and starting only alsa-utils does also not work; timidity prompts the following message when I try to start it again while the alsa-utils are running again:  "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[positive] [20:43] <Dan2552> jdong: i'll give it a try. Also ubuntu works out time remaining on my battery - and my battery doesnt even have a hardware counter :) amazing
[positive] [20:44] <jdong> Dan2552: amazing how much hardware makers skimp these days, no? :)
[positive] [20:44] <Vlet> Gigi: found the answer :) http://tinyurl.com/yvc62t
[negative] [20:45] <Yarcanox> oh no not pasting :(
[positive] [20:46] <Gigi> vlet cool :) thanks again!
[positive] [20:46] <Vlet> Gigi: glad to help... like most problems, a minute or so of google and patience finds the answer :)
[positive] [20:51] <pike_> Yarcanox: erm... condolences i guess sry :)
[positive] [20:52] <Dr_willis> askand,  cool air does. :)
[positive] [20:52] <swirv> yasper : you whouldn't happen to have a Dell by any chance :)

[positive] [20:56] <arT2> hi there :) anyone knows other audio players (if similiar to foobar would be killer) ? i've checked amarok (to overloaded), exaile, quodlibet, bmpx and rhythmbox.
[positive] [20:56] <rryan> hearsedriver : Ok.. hmm, USB thumb drive :) ?    Anyhow... I imagine there's a kernel option that drops you to a root shell, I just can't remember it
[positive] [20:57] <src> kahrytan, do a google search for /etc/fstab and do some quality reading. you'll gonna figure it out :)
[positive] [20:58] <ubuntuchick> its installing them as we speak :)
[negative] [20:59] <Deformation> psyjoniz: no it does not have that :(
[positive] [20:59] <Dr_willis> src,  i wonder if telling him to 'man fstab' and look under th user option is allowed. :)
[positive] [21:00] <src> Dr_willis, the man page of fstab is even less userfriendly :)
[positive] [21:04] <pike_> puli: hi welcome to ubuntu :)
[positive] [21:07] <akorn> emmajane: thanks :)
[positive] [21:10] <src> :)
[positive] [21:10] <Dr_willis> Psi-Jack,  its in the repos.. yet another command ive never noticed.. :) cool. learned somthing today!
[negative] [21:11] <emmajane> nonix4: bummer. :( If it's any consolation I've made some (similar) bad partitioning decisions.
[positive] [21:11] <Dr_willis> omega_,  you might want to check out the apache docs and faq befor bugging them :)
[positive] [21:12] <emmajane> nonix4: heh. I made a pact with myself to never try to guess how much to put into 18 different partitions for custom linux installs. :)
[positive] [21:13] <haru> Psi-Jack, how do i find out my options :)
[positive] [21:14] <pike_> puli: yes cool language :) you should just be able to drag and drop those files to same dir as the other ttf files
[positive] [21:14] <emmajane> nonix4: I had a demon laptop once. I understand your pain! :)
[positive] [21:16] <Deformation> psyjoniz: tyt :)

[positive] [21:28] <bofh80> warbisshop, cool. let us know what you find :)
[positive] [21:28] <pike_> puli: that should be it. a reboot also would have worked but that is a little drastic :)
[positive] [21:30] <pike_> puli: hope you stick with ubuntu :)  that command just rereads the fonts installed to build the cache  the cache is what ubuntu actually uses  windows is the same
[negative] [21:39] <Wil1> i want my gutsy :(
[positive] [21:45] <OrionDude> Vlet ... im a windows server admin ... i just expected the interface to pop up from the start .. that got me stumped ... but its installing now :)

[positive] [21:51] <Vlet> SveinT: you'd have to break a lot of package dependencies.... and I bet everything would be broke :)
[negative] [21:52] <bofh80> Tigerman, then i'd say you can safely remove hotkeys it's not going to help :(
[positive] [21:53] <Tigerman> bofh80, okay let's dig in :)
[positive] [21:54] <Tigerman> bofh80, yeah :)
[positive] [22:02] <lavender_dream> src: not my issue, was chalcedony :)

[positive] [22:04] <Baldev> neopsyche: wish i could sudo entire-workplace linux :)
[positive] [22:07] <eregi> neopsyche ok, ok :)
[positive] [22:07] <bofh80> Tigerman, i'm just that good :) glad to have helped :)
[positive] [22:08] <bofh80> Tigerman, the thought process was "it says launch 'web browser' but HOW does it know WHAT web browser....tick tick tick 'click' :)
[positive] [22:15] <john> PriceChild, duh :)
[positive] [22:25] <LjL> Ominous_: well, now effects are integrated by default, on cards that are known to support them correctly - so it either works for you out of the box, or you go hunting unofficial documentation :)
[positive] [22:25] <Esteth> LiMaO: Thanks, that freed the space back up :)

[positive] [22:36] <soundray> openforlife: you could use the existing xorg.conf and the info in /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx/README.txt.gz to hand-craft your perfect config :)
[positive] [22:39] <nickrud> cimon: so I see :)
[positive] [22:40] <nickrud> PriceChild: sounds good :)
[positive] [22:41] <soundray> petfrogg: once you get a patch of your own accepted into the kernel, you're not :)

[12:20] <razzia> my wlancard wont work :( - ive tried so much.. im using the new ubuntu and i have an Atheros Communications, Inc. AR5005G 802.11abg NIC (rev 01) card
[12:26] <teethdood> man, I only got the Basic version :(
[12:30] <zcat[1] > greg_g, I've only had experience with one; 915 iirc... not sure of the technical details but I installed edgy with beryl, vlc, codecs, etc.. and it everything was accelerated out of the box. Awesome. Until I tried to run some games :(
[12:33] <deserteagle> i wish my X could get fixed :(
[01:21] <BlueScreenKid> yuckity ... yuckity .. yuck ... to get my ati 9600xt to work properly i had to use non-open source drivers ... where on edgy i could use open source .. why this backwards step :(
[01:28] <lando__> i took away my own permission to access administrationi settings :(
[01:34] <lando__> it says to contact admin :(

[03:11] <VividHazE> Impaque: Am I screwed then, I was hoping to have all my files on the one computer so the other computers and laptops in the house could read it from them :(
[03:42] <mzaza> SmSpillaz: it's just when ubuntuforums had the tags for fiesty i found a topic for solving this problem easily. its just they removed the tags i can't find it :(
[03:43] <delmorep> mzaza: you might try beryl instead -- its in the repos now, remove compiz first.... ive never had any problems with beryl... but i had so many problems with compiz :( sometimes the close-X's on progams dont work... similar black screen problems that youve had too
[03:48] <tom_> :(
[03:53] <NemesisD> blazemonger, im sorry to hear that :(
[03:57] <randomwalker> NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
[04:04] <rbrtoclto> xt: had any problems?  there was a race condition between some scripts in the beta that caused 9/10 boots to fail, I've only booted twice running feisty release and one has failed :(

[08:36] <DARKGuy> _3uG_: I'm out of ideas =/ I'd say use envy to uninstall everything nvidia-related, remove linux-restricted-modules, restart comp and try installing the nvidia driver... that's what I did anyways =/ other than that, I have no idea :(
[08:40] <DaMi3n> they dont work :(
[08:45] <DaMi3n> liquiddoom, didnt work :( says [mntent] : line 16 in /etc/fstab is bad
[08:50] <endlessurf> i lost my sound :(..
[08:59] <DARKGuy> _3uG_: I'm sorry then :(... basically, all you have to do is to remove anything ubuntu related to nvidia, and just reinstall the nvidia driver - I admit, they made it damn harder now >.<

I dont have any sound, A black screen on 1 on 2 reboot (besides of the Gdm login screen)   ect..ect. I need serious help (mostly with these 2 problems) I'm with Ubuntu since Hoary, and i never seen it this buggy.    :(
[05:08] <Makgyver> boy I really wish I could get Ubuntu onto my PowerMac :(
[05:37] <Nikonlappy> roxygirl: that means since you arent in the US you cant watch those videos.  I have that same problem when trying to watch dr who  from the UK :(

[07:14] <dakz0rz> I have a problem, I installed Ubuntu however I can't get a wireless connection working. On the taskbar, I can 'Enable Networking' properly but I can't press 'Enable Wireless'. When I list the devices in terminal a wireless card is there... help :(
[07:16] <MrRoboto> cool:  gone??? dead??  it wont show on another ubuntu machine I have ... :( ... I just unmounted it ... some hours ago

[08:06] <JKirk_> help!!!  I just did a fresh install of 8.04 and I can't find file sharing... it was right in the menus in the beta....what happened to it? :(
[08:11] <JKirk_> that sudo mount doesn't work :(
[08:20] <JKirk_> no one can help me?  :(
[08:27] <rahul_> hello. Ubuntu newbie here. I installed 8.04 hoping it would detect pre-installed XP, but now I am unable to boot into XP :(
[08:31] <Bartosz> cool, I've installed it by EnvyNG it should be correct :(
[08:53] <JKirk_> can someone PLEASE help me share folders in 8.04?  They seem to have taken out the function in the release... :(
[09:10] <razel> anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
[09:30] <timandtom> rothchild: No idea :( In 7.10, it just automatically asked me if I wanted to enable the restricted drivers for the card, so I did. If I use the "Hardware Testing" option in System>Administrator, then it detects what it is, but that doesn't help any. It just tells me it's name
[09:37] <timandtom> rothchild: :( The only ones I'm finding for Broadcom is two for the 43xx, I have the 44xx...
[09:46] <askand> ï»¿dystopianray: not for me sadly, tried everything on the net :(
[10:02] <timandtom> rothchild: If that's the little On/Off button... :( It seems to have been killed as well. Doesn't work. I hit it, and Wireless Network shows up in my networking, but it wont actually find any networks
[10:06] <askand> dystopianray: sadly it still increase with one every 5 secs :(
[10:10] <timandtom> rothchild: :( That doesnt work for me
[10:12] <Tobias> Okay Ubuntu people. Hardy really screwed over my system. I tried to upgrade via commandline because the graphical upgrader kept crashing. Now, I'm stuck with commandline root access and a broken dpkg and X server :(. Is there any way I can tell dpkg to stop acting silly?
[10:24] <timandtom> rothchild: :( No luck. And I made sure to leave it on when I restarted
[10:33] <amerio> timandtom: I even tried madwifi irc room but they didnt help much :(
[10:35] <timandtom> amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
[10:35] <timandtom> MttJocy: Thanks, already did though. But, that doesn't help me get it working NOW :(

[16:45] <weaver> hi. Ubuntu 8.04 won't install the bootloader during the installation, and manual bootloader install doesn't work :(
[16:53] <ENFEFI> Hello!! Maybe someone could help me and explain something to me. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 and my laptop has a wireless card. When I type lspci -v this is what I got: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03). But now when I try to install the firmware I see there are two options: bcm43xx-fwcutter and b43-fwcutter. I don't know which one is the right choice to me :(
[16:57] <crispy--> Hey, im trying to install 8.04 using just grub and the alternative iso file. Ive tried to do as described here: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-ubuntukubuntuedubuntuxubuntu-without-cdrom-drive.html but this does not work for 8.04 :(

[18:27] <Marce_> zog, but i wanted to have propertary drivers working :(
[18:27] <dinho-br> Kr0ntab: as I said, I have a dual-boot with Windows, and it is working... :(
[18:33] <gor1> mindlord: if u moved the machine, I'd check that a/ your heatsink hasnt come loose, and b/ nothing else is loose while you're at it, especiall ythe graphics card if AGP, (unscrew, undo clip at far end, resinsert and screw in again)   and   seeing u have a 1GHz cpu, is the heatsink pase old? 5 mins poking around might be worth it, intermittent lockups drive u crazy :(
[18:39] <BlackIrish> finally, my ubuntu is so messed up I couldn't even open Pidgin :(

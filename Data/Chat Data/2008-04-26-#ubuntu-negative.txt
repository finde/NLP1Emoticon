Hmm.. I need some help with Ubuntu 8.04, I just did a fresh install on my desktop, the install went okay, but everytime I try to boot into it I get the busybox. :(
Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
astro: ah ok thx. do you pr chance know of a workaround? I bet if I try to fix xp now with the repair thingie it will screw ubuntu up :(
MattJ: I do :(

I dont have any sound, A black screen on 1 on 2 reboot (besides of the Gdm login screen)   ect..ect. I need serious help (mostly with these 2 problems) I'm with Ubuntu since Hoary, and i never seen it this buggy.    :(
boy I really wish I could get Ubuntu onto my PowerMac :(
roxygirl: that means since you arent in the US you cant watch those videos.  I have that same problem when trying to watch dr who  from the UK :(

I have a problem, I installed Ubuntu however I can't get a wireless connection working. On the taskbar, I can 'Enable Networking' properly but I can't press 'Enable Wireless'. When I list the devices in terminal a wireless card is there... help :(
cool:  gone??? dead??  it wont show on another ubuntu machine I have ... :( ... I just unmounted it ... some hours ago
AH CRAP, ubuntu+1 forwards to this channel now? :(
help!!!  I just did a fresh install of 8.04 and I can't find file sharing... it was right in the menus in the beta....what happened to it? :(
that sudo mount doesn't work :(
no one can help me?  :(
hello. Ubuntu newbie here. I installed 8.04 hoping it would detect pre-installed XP, but now I am unable to boot into XP :(
cool, I've installed it by EnvyNG it should be correct :(
can someone PLEASE help me share folders in 8.04?  They seem to have taken out the function in the release... :(
anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
rothchild: No idea :( In 7.10, it just automatically asked me if I wanted to enable the restricted drivers for the card, so I did. If I use the "Hardware Testing" option in System>Administrator, then it detects what it is, but that doesn't help any. It just tells me it's name
rothchild: :( The only ones I'm finding for Broadcom is two for the 43xx, I have the 44xx...
ï»¿dystopianray: not for me sadly, tried everything on the net :(
rothchild: If that's the little On/Off button... :( It seems to have been killed as well. Doesn't work. I hit it, and Wireless Network shows up in my networking, but it wont actually find any networks
dystopianray: sadly it still increase with one every 5 secs :(
rothchild: :( That doesnt work for me
Okay Ubuntu people. Hardy really screwed over my system. I tried to upgrade via commandline because the graphical upgrader kept crashing. Now, I'm stuck with commandline root access and a broken dpkg and X server :(. Is there any way I can tell dpkg to stop acting silly?
rothchild: :( No luck. And I made sure to leave it on when I restarted
timandtom: I even tried madwifi irc room but they didnt help much :(
amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
MttJocy: Thanks, already did though. But, that doesn't help me get it working NOW :(
:(
jpatrick, too bad :(

hi. Ubuntu 8.04 won't install the bootloader during the installation, and manual bootloader install doesn't work :(
Hello!! Maybe someone could help me and explain something to me. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 and my laptop has a wireless card. When I type lspci -v this is what I got: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03). But now when I try to install the firmware I see there are two options: bcm43xx-fwcutter and b43-fwcutter. I don't know which one is the right choice to me :(

Kr0ntab: as I said, I have a dual-boot with Windows, and it is working... :(
mindlord: if u moved the machine, I'd check that a/ your heatsink hasnt come loose, and b/ nothing else is loose while you're at it, especiall ythe graphics card if AGP, (unscrew, undo clip at far end, resinsert and screw in again)   and   seeing u have a 1GHz cpu, is the heatsink pase old? 5 mins poking around might be worth it, intermittent lockups drive u crazy :(
finally, my ubuntu is so messed up I couldn't even open Pidgin :(

[00:00] <Jordan_U> k1gwb, Yes, but not easy :)
[00:00] <ubotu> espen: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[00:05] <src> Dumptruck, I don't know how to fix that :)
[00:15] <vraa> does someone know how to put this ubuntu alternate iso i downloaded onto a 4gb usb flash disk and install from it? i'm out of cd-r's :(
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: whenever I try to update. it shows nothing in my update list. It thinks i'm up-to-date :)
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: Okay. that what I'm going to do :)
[00:18] <YoDaddeh> guess nobody knows how to help me with this problem :(
[00:19] <vraa> OiPenguin: if you check the links, it says that all issues with this laptop have been resolved. so that means with little or no effort, ubuntu will work fine :)
[00:19] <garu> espen oh, ok then, then do the restart then :)
[00:20] <vraa> OiPenguin: if you're unsure, you can always download now and install later :)
[00:20] <speaker219> No problem OiPenguin :)
[00:26] <wycked> okay thank you Cable86 garu Jimdb :)
[00:26] <nickrud> juanbond: Media Player on the menu :) (its rhythmbox)
[00:27] <CarlF1> Gambaroni: I had the same 'issue' :)
[00:28] <Gambaroni> CarlF1 :).. So no svn server would be set up automatically?
[00:30] <nickrud> Dumptruck: just like a ninja, practice, fall down, get up, practice, fall down :)
[00:30] <mutable> Hi. I read that in gusty is fixed nvidia driver (that doesn't cause out of mem bug). However I still see black windows :(.
[00:39] <lavender_dream> easy question to some of you, is it possible to browse the 'net as just text via the terminal? :) if so how?
[00:41] <lavender_dream> Flannel: that's cool :)
[00:43] <lavender_dream> Flannel: that www.browser tip you just gave me... THAT'S REALLY COOL! :) it's quaint, I love it
[00:46] <Rabiddog> zakman, compile your own kernel :)
[00:47] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: If you ask a question, they can but try :)
[00:51] <D2006> not really. just my first use of xchat. used to use (:)) mIRC on windows
[00:52] <D2006> Fastn: maybe they just use another algorithms to calc the real volume. for instance: winamp on windows has 3 different ways to calc volume: linear, logarithmic and hypersomthing :)
[00:53] <Fasma_> finally! a freaking irc chat client! :)
[00:55] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: Great, no problem :)

[01:17] <sammyF> Tortured: sigh .. I was being lazy.. but thanks :)
[01:21] <sammyF> pyrak: lol ... okay .. I did misunderstand it :)
[01:37] <kibble> Eagle3--: I'm a slack man from 95ish, I'm used to it :)
[01:45] <kibble> or maybe he should have looked before he asked :)
[01:48] <phaedra> rtan, Okay....  :)
[01:54] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: since I can't reproduce the problem, I'm sorry...I can't really help :(
[01:59] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: or the other way around.. fglrx doesnt play well with xserver-glx :)
[02:11] <neopsyche> :(
[02:11] <garu_> VousDeux there is a video in youtube, with a guy being ironic saying that ms didnt copy mac os x!have a look at that, u'll change ur mind, I garantee you :)
[02:14] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: kk.. I think I said glx earlier.. just had a strange feeling when the it was xgl :)
[02:15] <kibble> Kelley: pfft, only 80gb? buy a new drive :)
[02:15] <Fasma> newbie: can I open a new window on a new chat network without losing the window I'm on? how? TIA! :)
[02:16] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: I typed it wrong.. a lot :)
[02:17] <garu_> VousDeux no problem :)!
[02:19] <Cryoniq> garu_: if I try aticonfig it will coredump and have xorg.conf dissapear as well.. funny problems here :)
[02:19] <garu_> Cryoniq funny indeed :o!:)
[02:20] <garu_> be right back...I'll do a restart to see if now I can play dvd's :)
[02:22] <Jaggs> the kind that they put in this POS computer :)
[02:28] <kibble> nibsa1242b: yeah I suppose if it removes the empty space :)
[02:29] <org> Hi there. I just installed fresh gutsy and I think i didn't partition very well. :(
[02:30] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:33] <org> mark, and why doesnt my /dev/sda1 device which is at mount point "/" doesnt have type "ext3" :(
[02:36] <neosix> :)
[02:37] <org> mark_, is my partitions are OK you think? I'm pretty new and the only thing that confuse me right now, is partitioning good:)
[02:39] <tux97> :((
[02:42] <tux> Arenlor: no luck :(
[02:42] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: ah hmm.. going to fiddle some more and enable it again.. thanks for answering all my questions :) Very helpful :)
[02:45] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: I experience it like that also. Yeah.. I heard there is one on the way.. :)
[02:46] <IcemanV9> Pelo: ha. well put. :)
[02:48] <warbler> Pelo: no luck there :(
[02:48] <tux> Arenlor: yes but it doesn't load :(
[02:53] <org> I just installed Gutsy and i would like a tutorials that tells me few useful packages that I do really need to install as a start :)
[02:54] <org> I just installed Gutsy and i would like a tutorials that tells me few useful packages that I do really need to install as a start :)
[03:02] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:03] <knix> MenZa: build-essentials was the one :)
[03:03] <MenZa> knix: Oh yeah; that installs build tools and stuff. :)
[03:04] <K3nt> MenZa: good thing i have free time, :)
[03:06] <MenZa> No, we'll be staying in the channel, so others may benefit from it as well---don't worry. :)
[03:07] <MenZa> K3nto: Sure :)
[03:13] <mark_> Kelley: And email. :) (unless htey have web-based email)
[03:15] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, thats exactly what i thought :) And im not even have tons of apps open
[03:18] <mark_> Kelley: But one thing at a time. :) Just trying out Linux will be enough for now, I'm sure. :)
[03:21] <ubotu> racarter: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:22] <MenZa> Why do you want to reinstall Ubuntu? :)
[03:23] <MenZa> slyder: Because your DVD is set as a repository :)
[03:24] <NemesisD> ok i just rebooted and it took me to the login prompt and now im just sitting at a light blue screen :)
[03:25] <Vlet> biggahed: if it's been a while since you asked your question, you may want to re-ask.. within reason :)
[03:26] <mpeters> thank you very much :)
[03:27] <org> yeah I know... but sometime i have terminal and underneath it is an Xchat. then words are into each other. How do you manage that? give me some screenshots of yours let me get an idea!!! :) pls
[03:29] <trogdor> mark_: I got something like that for eterm, its like terminal camou or something, very kool :)
[03:39] <VousDeux> I think that Xubuntu VM will make a pretty good hack environment...I think I'll keep it :)
[03:46] <VousDeux> Madpilot: thanks, I'll give it a shot :)
[03:47] <mbone> nothing there :)
[03:49] <VousDeux> Madpilot: thanks again :)
[03:58] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: just just search gstreamer 10 in synaptic and grab all those not ending in -doc or -dbg :)
[04:01] <IdleOne> T1m: always search in Syanptic before compiling :)
[04:05] <IntuitiveNipple> ntfs-3g's ntfsresize does the job well - I've never had it go ga-ga :)
[04:09] <T1m> IdleOne: thanks :)
[04:09] <timewriter> and it runs bad :(
[04:14] <IdleOne> mikeo2: cool :)
[04:15] <Pir8> I think I just got a whole yard closer to ditching windows :)
[04:17] <prakriti> :(
[04:19] <ubotu> mrpyrover666: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:22] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:23] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: most people in here are :)
[04:26] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: I agree :) How are you running smbpasswd, and what is the error?
[04:26] <biggahed> astro76, none taken :) im just puzzled by this weird behavior. For me at least. I dont see the i386 version caching so agressively
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: 'pride before the fall' and all that :)
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: No... but don't celebrate too prematurely :)
[04:34] <org> :(
[04:34] <mikeo2> i use them to control xmms :)
[04:35] <org> wastrel, cool... thanks :)
[04:38] <Jordan_U> trogdor, I used to run it :)
[04:40] <ubotu> PokoTao: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:40] <pwnt-> Cool, I got my mouse buttons to work! all of them :)
[04:42] <Jordan_U> Sir_Sid, It removes the driver that lets you send sound to your system beep hardware :)
[04:42] <PokoTao> ok, good point :). I'm trying to install Glade on 7.10, but Synaptic says glade-gnome requires glade-common >= 2.8. Unfortunately, Synaptic only has glade-common at 2.12.
[04:43] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, funny that... all the logs are empty :)
[04:44] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, Try any of them, since you havn't had any problems before they are likely all good, or just delete your current one and let X figure itself out on its own :)
[04:46] <Jordan_U> Talcite, I doubt that you have an itanium server :)
[04:47] <IntuitiveNipple> Madpilot: Yes, there are a few annoyances :)
[04:49] <Tastum_> Hi, I just perused the FAQ and forums and couldn't seem to find something that works for me.  On my first gutsy boot I get nothing after "Running Local Boot Scripts (/etc/rc.local).  I suspect some problems with my display settings, but have mucked around with xorg.conf to no avail trying to use both the open source ati driver and VESA.  Is there something I'm missing?  I'm new to Ubuntu, being a gentoo user normally :)
[04:50] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, you know it helps if you specify a username with smbpasswd :)
[04:56] <Jordan_U> times1, Check the terminal output ( I am having a problem but it's my own fault :)
[04:57] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, "ubuntu" is the default user on a LiveCD, his nick is only Ubuntu because he logged on without changing it :)
[05:01] <Tastum_> argh, wish I had saved my xorg.conf from my gentoo setup, might have helped me track this problem :(
[05:02] <IntuitiveNipple> Lerris: But, it could affect a less knowlegeable user who would consult the bug reports and get a clue at least :)
[05:03] <Vlet> ShadowMinds: there's really just a few options for positioning the picture.. gotta live with what ya got :)
[05:05] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:08] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:10] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: As for the swap-space, to be honest I can't remember what the installer does in guided mode but it should create a swap partition :)
[05:12] <Vlet> Shoopuf: :)
[05:12] <Helmi> hey guys - i just activated visual effects in gutsy and i'm looking for the control panel to setup the effects in detail and can't find it :(
[05:14] <kingnothing> okay :)
[05:15] <Ashfire908> asbani, no i mean use the search box :)
[05:16] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:16] <asbani> mechdave: I just got a fresh gutsy install :)
[05:17] <asbani> mechdave: whats also important things to install such as build-essentail for a new system? :)
[05:19] <Shoopuf> So I installed Exaile, then when I double click an MP3 within it the screen goes grey and it stops responding. :( Is that normal...
[05:19] <CyberMad> does anyone know how to join chatroom from yahoo messenger? there is no that feature on gaim :(
[05:20] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: i'm doing a google on it, i work at a pc place so i can help out alot :)
[05:21] <mechdave> nrdb, Uum yeah, thx :)
[05:22] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: its a 19" LCD Flat Panel monitor :)
[05:22] <slackern> asbani: nah i don't think you need to, mine is working perfect as it is, it just seems to sort itself automaticlly for me :)
[05:26] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If it is the swap you are creating, then the type is swap :)
[05:28] <Dialntone> that kino isn't very friendly.. :( doesn't even play .avi files...
[05:30] <asbani> Thanks mechdave. what you told me did the job :)
[05:31] <Vlet> arang2: google google google :)
[05:33] <Vlet> Yowsers: ssh :)
[05:36] <mechdave> :)
[05:37] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Time for a cuppa :)
[05:42] <briantumor> cool :)
[05:43] <asbani> briantumor: but give it a try :) if there is only one WM That can be run in a 64mb ram system it diffnently would be fluxbox
[05:53] <ubotu> fit4lfe: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[05:56] <Dialntone> bah u gave me bugs :) lol
[05:56] <ShakaGoldSaint> hi there, i'm trying to install ubuntu 7.10 using the live cd, but when i select manual partitioning, the install wizard doesn't show my partitions :(
[06:01] <ubotu> Kousotu: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:03] <Vlet> Ubuntu101: more :)
[06:05] <n2diy> Allenwr: Don't know, I'm a Ubuntu user now! :)
[06:12] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Yes, it is a GNU/Linux distribution :)
[06:15] <Wolf23> jrib:  i dont like to put my hand and make errors :(
[06:15] <limecat> thanks for all the info :)
[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> there you go hendrixski :)
[06:17] <Falstius> agwells: texmaker is so limiting, and no preview function :(
[06:18] <ubotu> smy1220: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:20] <limecat> joanki: wine is an approximation of what windows can do, its not perfect.  Check their site before assuming :)
[06:22] <Vlet> joanki: pace yourself :)
[06:23] <limecat> chowmeined: btw, when is ext3 or XFS getting awesome permissions like ntfs >:(
[06:23] <limecat> i like my extended permissions :(
[06:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: makes sense :)
[06:31] <IntuitiveNipple> A day? I'm gonna give it 2 hours later this morning to install Gutsy Server on a Dell Poweredge server :)
[06:40] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> :(
[06:42] <LordMeka> :))
[06:44] <Jordan_U> Geri, Hi, you might want to join #ubuntu-offtopic, this is just the support channel :)
[06:45] <Vlet> MASTER_OF_THE_CH: maybe you're the first to try :)
[06:45] <Jordan_U> Geri, np :)
[06:54] <Jordan_U> poningru, I am in the middle of the upgrade :)
[06:56] <IntuitiveNipple> extrakick: There are a lways problems, whether issues to do with hardware config, user-misunderstanding, or previous configuration settings confusing updates. You have to remember that people generally don't come here to report a success, only a problem :)
[06:59] <riotkittie> wubuntu: lovely :( file a bug report?
[06:59] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Well, no packages have actually been installed yet, so there is the third choice of backing out entirely and avoiding possible brickage :)
[07:00] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, :(
[07:02] <Jordan_U> extrakick, Does X restart when you run "glxinfo"? ( don't try it obviously unless you are prepared for X to crash :)
[07:03] <arun_> poningru: you just said gnash doesn't work well on all websites :)
[07:06] <BlaenkDenum> Blama: go to irc.mozilla.org #firefox and ask them there, sorry I don't know :( but they're really smart over there
[07:07] <Jordan_U> extrakick, No, it's just that that is why cards are usually blacklisted, because a check can't be safely done to see if they would support compiz ( I have one such card, a SIS :( )
[07:09] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, I'm aborting :(
[07:23] <IntuitiveNipple> Vantage13: hmmm...maybe I installed somethinf extra :) (I have Seahorse installed)
[07:23] <tux97_> aranel i finaly got it to work to play mp3s but it wont play the riped music out of itunes :(
[07:28] <Blama> Jordan_U, It will not let me download Macromedia Flash Plugin :( I cannot check it off
[07:28] <Jordan_U> DanMulvey, Install Gutsy :)
[07:28] <scguy318> josss: so I guess try safe graphics? :)
[07:30] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, "Could not calculate the upgrade" :(
[07:33] <todkon> ActySofts: lol welcome... didn't work for me though :( :( :(*
[07:37] <Brown_Cat> scguy318: sorry :(

[07:44] <tritium> Just muted you to avoid the spam, buddy :)
[07:49] <donmarinelo> good morning :) i have questions/ 1st how to install 32 bit packages on ubuntu 64 7.1 / 2-nd what is the spell fo making it play DVD-s /
[07:53] <ubotu> IlanG: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:56] <riotkittie> :)
[07:58] <IcemanV9> Vantage13: so is mine :)
[08:01] <IcemanV9> Vantage13: cool. enjoy :)
[08:04] <cyphase> Vantage13:  maybe that's just a placebo effect :)
[08:04] <Vantage13> cyphase: it wouldn't be.  No hardware acceleration :)
[08:07] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, It is now randomly able to "calculate the upgrade" again... it'll be a miracle if this works :)
[08:08] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Or not, it says it can't calculate again :(
[08:11] <Jordan_U> scguy318, You forgot the mount :)
[08:17] <IcemanV9> IlanG: nm. you found it. :)
[08:25] <bryce_> jlilly, seems that way :(
[08:26] <jlilly> bryce_: yea. I've been trying to get my displays fixed all day. Its killing me not having this :( :(
[08:26] <ubotu> saretta^-^: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:35] <IcemanV9> ckw__: Vlet is the correct spell as jotil mentioned :)
[08:39] <ubotu> puli: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[08:40] <gouki> For any Tribal Wars players out there... I just created UBU (Ubuntu Users) tribe. Feel free to join! :)
[08:52] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:10] <Dyus> adante: no problem :)
[09:27] <Jordan_U> gkwong, Not that long of a discrepancy usually but yes, Linux isn't optimized for fast boots as much as windows ( though you don't need to boot nearly as much :)
[09:31] <dga> zyxnull: unfortunately :(
[09:53] <gharz> :(
[10:02] <msikma> Hi ubotu :)

[10:24] <Chaos88> Anolys 1gb ddr 333 (old) :)
[10:25] <dromer> only getting a tty kind of sucks :(
[10:26] <Chaos88> Anolys now I'm on windows, when I tried, only firefox was running (sorry for my english) :)
[10:27] <sku> mechdave: all my computers are crashing on me :(  I'm thinking i might just do a fresh install of 7.10, usb appears to be not functioning properly either
[10:28] <Chaos88> ok :)
[10:29] <Chaos88> who can help me? Firefox is very very slow with ubuntu 7.10 :(
[10:33] <Chaos88> kaminix ok I restart ubuntu and I try :)

[10:47] <Smegzor> hmm..  i looked there first and it wasn't :(
[10:48] <knix> murlidhar: If I Recall Correctly :)
[10:48] <murlidhar> knix: ah thanks :)
[10:50] <LordLimecat> alright, thanks :)
[10:51] <dox> anolis: what? :)
[10:58] <harp> anolis I'll try to use actual monitor controls, but I suppose that xorg.conf must do it too :)
[11:04] <mechdave_away> gharz: 1 second mate :)
[11:05] <murlidhar> :(
[11:05] <lavender_dream> nesoi: no, go ahead and edit again :)
[11:06] <mechdave_away> gharz: can you hold off for 10, my dinner is getting cold and my wife is yelling to come and eat :(
[11:06] <gharz> :)
[11:09] <ubotu> nullkuhl: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[11:10] <`ph8> Keel - i haven't used it this time :)
[11:13] <`ph8> your setup is very similar to mine :( not sure what's going wrong
[11:14] <cwillu> bluefox83: sweet :)
[11:14] <dromer> gah, my desktop is now so fucked-up :(
[11:16] <gharz> nobody has helped me yet. :)
[11:16] <bluefox83> damnit, i can't get my freakin nvidia card drivers to work worth a damn :(
[11:17] <mechdave> gharz: Alright now your your wireless card... refresh my memory as the buffer has been overwritten :(

[11:58] <abhibera> cwillu: i was getting a BROKEN LINK on gcc.real. so i did a apt-get install gcc-4.1 --reinstall and problem solved :)
[11:58] <cwillu> abhibera: that's weird;  I just checked half a dozen machines I have, none of them have any gcc.real symlink :)
[11:59] <abhibera> cwillu: i think that came when i did a apt-get install gcc --reinstall :)

[12:52] <IntuitiveNipple> compwiz18: Yes :) ... I recall something like this from a few months ago... let me trawl launchpad for a few mins
[12:55] <IntuitiveNipple> compwiz18: I was thinking more about if VT console's also lose input, but it sounds like it is restricted to input-focus on Gnome. I had it happen a while back but I deal with so many bugs I've got to trawl to find it :)
[12:56] <IdleOne> remus: there is windows wich does not require any brains at all and only the ability to click Next and Finish :)
[12:59] <tatters> how is one supposed to run vmserver it has dissapeared from repos, the latest build fails to well......build and the  "any any " patch fails to patch :(

[15:21] <[NikO]> shwouchk, sorry, it s funny :)
[15:22] <Seveas> cratel, you can re-add the panel :)
[15:24] <Seveas> cratel, you could take a screenshot as the other user and then make your panel look exactly like it :)
[15:27] <eiaway> saloxin: :(
[15:29] <eiaway> darn, i was hping ubuntu would be easier as windows :(
[15:30] <eiaway> i have even 6.06 apperently :)
[15:32] <chippy> :) gusty sounds nice
[15:32] <kane77> wolferine, at the beginning I was only going for one (/), but soon I found out that that's not too good (in case like reinstalling I have to back up /home.. and then there were couple of things I needed on separate.. so now I have /, /home, /tmp, /boot, /var/lib/mysql and /var/www :)
[15:33] <eiaway> saloxin: will it do that automaticly? or do I have to do like 10 upgrades manually? :)
[15:39] <LjL> shwouchk: only thing i can suggest trying is "noapic" as a kernel parameter... it's the standard suggestion when something that sounds kernel-related goes wrong and one has no clue :)
[15:40] <swill> annabelle: pidgin is not working for you.  :)
[15:43] <mortal1> flick, woohoo 1000 KB/s! :)
[15:45] <LjL> keo92: and, virtualbox uses Qt not GTK :)
[15:45] <flick> mortal1, good for you :)
[15:49] <erUSUL> flick: :)
[15:52] <muszek_> annabelle: you're welcome (and use tab completion next time... you're still not typing "muszek_", but " muszek" :) )
[15:53] <muszek_> swill: heh :)
[15:55] <swill> sounds like my install of gutsy is better than most peoples, but i am still having problems.  :)
[15:59] <Klowner> Paradoxx: usually your eyes blink at a regular interval, make sure it's not those that you're noticing :)
[16:04] <poningru> Joanki: sorry I was mean earlier dude :), just go to system->pref->appearance
[16:12] <mordaunt> rebuilding the ubuntu kernel the ubuntu way is messed up :(

[17:23] <liberum> PanicByte: But it worked fine in feisty... and i kind of like having 3D :)
[17:24] <nvictor> Joanki: :)
[17:29] <mutable> bulmer: to store password for some email accounts :)
[17:30] <JarG0n> slackern> thx :)
[17:34] <depinko> slackern: interesting, :(
[17:35] <mutable> bulmer: i just want to store passowrd for access to newsgroup, i don't want to enter it manually everytime because it's a generated one. so i need to store it on password file. pine by default stores it in ~/.pine.pwd, but alpine doesn't. however thx for assistance :)
[17:36] <Vis> Jo3: Sorry, all I can suggest is working through the link I posted and trying everything :(
[17:37] <Vis> Jo3: Youre welcome :)
[17:43] <dmnd> or whatever it's called :)
[17:48] <indio> :)
[17:57] <Tomi_G> anyone: I don't see my NTFS partition :(
[17:58] <openforlife> skotos: sure :)
[17:59] <NemesisD> saloxin, ill take the latter :) how do i do it though
[17:59] <dmnd> zap0: great! :), it's not that hard as you think :)
[18:01] <Dr_willis> oritemis,  thats using the ccsm tool. :)
[18:02] <Dr_willis> oritemis,  this has been discussed in #kubuntu quite a bit. :)
[18:03] <guardian> is gutsy supposed to support emu 1212 soundcards ? cause i upgraded and alsa doesn't see any sound card :(
[18:05] <valmarko> ompaul, you're the boss :) 'rambling discussion' is a relative term but... my mistake. I was used to other kind of criteria. Well... sorry again for the offtopic.
[18:07] <aoupi> mehevi: yea, but I don't know what to look for :)
[18:08] <Dr_willis> oritemis,  the bot just pasted it. :) read it.
[18:09] <aoupi> mehevi: I got no network and I hoped it was some easy way that didn't involve me writing it down :)
[18:10] <Foxdie> anyone know how to actually boot up succesfully from the 7.10 CDROM? :)
[18:11] <Tomi_G> mehevi: umm, how :) ?
[18:13] <surviver> Dr_willis, but i know what u mean thx ill fix it :))
[18:16] <Dr_willis> surviver,  i normally just have the 2nd guy ssh in, and start up vncserver manually. :) then he can start whatever vncclient he likes.
[18:18] <Dr_willis> surviver,  install winscp, and putty on the windows box's - MUST have tools :)
[18:20] <Dr_willis> MrBister,  creative has really been pathic in linux support for that card so far. :( sadly.
[18:21] <Dr_willis> surviver,  May want to just set up vnc to autospawn a login  gdm screen then.  You do knwo that vnc has a 'web interface' also? :)
[18:21] <eriks> foxdie-> dont know im just a newbie :(
[18:22] <Dr_willis> surviver,  it should have it also. I tend to use 'vnc4server'  :) check the web sites for the vncserver and configs it may need to be enabled specificially in the configs
[18:22] <Dr_willis> surviver,  its all in how you set up/use vnc. :)
[18:23] <Dr_willis> surviver,  ive learned/used/read vnc stuff for ages.. :)
[18:23] <Dr_willis> Whamazoom,  i used to. :)  but not now that gutsy is out.
[18:26] <mon^rch> TY Ubuntu team for a well designed OS!!! On my way to convert yet another user :))
[18:29] <ompaul> darkangel_, backup backup backup and try a fresh install might be a better idea - make sure you have more than one live CD handy :)
[18:29] <gharz> :(
[18:30] <jnc> gharz: ohhh... then maybe I'm on the right idea here :)
[18:36] <liberum> PanicByte: Well... it sort of worked.. but now the framerate it to slow :) i'm starting to think it's the graphics driver
[18:37] <surviver> Dr_willis, ok :)) but somehwere i read that i had to pay to use vnc
[18:37] <Dr_willis> surviver,  krfb seems to share the currently running desktop. is that what you really want? :)
[18:41] <Dr_willis> surviver,  you may want to try 'vnc4server' it has all those features that the realvnc guys want to chage for i thinl. :)
[18:42] <Tomi_G> Need some NTFS Gutsy help :)
[18:44] <Pir8> http://www.puleen.com/archives/120 <--- look at the second picture I posted :)
[18:44] <liberum> PanicByte: Already tried them all :) All are the same, but standard (standard is worse)
[18:47] <Tomi_G> I can't mount my NTFS partition on Gutsy :((((((
[18:50] <[chr0n0s]> ckw : i am still struggling for the first monitor :(

[19:12] <Dr_willis> scale or expo. i foreget which.. :) i dont like them.
[19:13] <Dr_willis> nrp,  thatw what i was thinking.. but that was too obvious. :)
[19:15] <jdong> PriceChild: oops thought this was another channel :)
[19:17] <Dr_willis> IHK,  thats what sudo is all about. :)
[19:24] <ubotu> Garoth: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[19:24] <Garoth> :)*
[19:27] <pike_> arang2: course you could always make /tmp a flash drive :)
[19:40] <Zippy2> i was using 6.10 at work and skipped over feisty, confused the two :)
[19:41] <scguy318> Garoth: other than that, I am empty :(
[19:43] <Garoth> scguy318: great to have someone try and help :)
[19:43] <scguy318> Garoth: why ty :)
[19:44] <Garoth> scguy318: but this channel is too crazy for me... message me if you have something to say. This irc doesn't turn off. :) Thanks again

[19:58] <crdlb> akorn, hmm I don't know why, but you should try upgrading to compiz fusion, ask in #compiz-fusion :)
[20:00] <generalsnus> tw2113: Thanks a lot :)  i couldnt get it to work at first, becouse i tried to extract from smb share :P

[20:33] <Mith36> Can anyone offer me some insight into why fglrxinfo would crash me back to the log in screen or if I can find a log of the crash report anywhere?  I searched for crash and .log and I couldn't find any that were related.  I can't even really troubleshoot myself without at least a crash report :(
[20:33] <Hristo> picard_pwns_kirk,  thanks anyway :)
[20:36] <tux_> crdlb: :( nobody is helping me there.
[20:38] <Shadoslayer> astro: I know, I just hate to waste another CD if this issue hasn't been fixed :)

[20:39] <Hristo> Mith36, thank you, i'll try :)
[20:40] <ubotu> neco_77: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[20:42] <Mith36> wow this file is massive :)
[20:43] <lamego> rainwalker, the problem, is that I told you about 100 times to comment 3rd party repositories :)
[20:43] <nickrud> Judgegeo: swap , you it's called swap :)
[20:44] <nickrud> GTroy: I've seen problems with both here, choose your poison :)
[20:44] <lamego> Ashfire908, you should look for the complains on upgrades :)
[20:45] <BoomSie> I made a backup from the homedir (tar cvpn something backup.tar.gz /home) and put it back after :)
[20:45] <BoomSie> looking glass, is the thing of SUN invented before compiz :)
[20:45] <BoomSie> performance is bad :(
[20:45] <Andycasss> I need some guidance - I am trying to set a command repeat when the destination address is not reachable. With a delay of 5 min:(

[05:16]	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo: what do you mean reinstall? I tried reinstalling the whole ubuntu distro with boot loader twice and same result. It just tries to load (and fails) ubuntu after a few seconds... :( I also tried using the install CD in recovery mode but wasn't sure what to do...
[05:17]	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo: as part of the system reinstall, the boot loader (LILO) was also reinstalled. It did not improve my situation. Breezy install went a lot smoother with GRUB...I don't have a choice of boot loader here.. :(
[05:21]	<scorpion007>	krazykit: I did that but it just spits out errors about /proc/devices not being present... :(

[09:14]	<ZeromusMog>	I'm a little dissapointed. I'm excited that the new Ubuntu can find my wireless card out of the box, and I heard it was delayed mostly for wireless support... so why isn't there a wifi manager :(
[09:16]	<ZeromusMog>	wastrel: my wifi is in there with SSID and password I set :(
[09:24]	<ketsugi>	>:(
[09:26]	<ZeromusMog>	Problem is the few things that don't work aren't just a matter of downloading a driver installer :(

[09:49]	<ZeromusDesktop>	Ah, I haven't used anything but Raid 0 so unfortunately I can't help you :(
[09:50]	<defunkt>	the power manager on dapper doesn't work apparently :(

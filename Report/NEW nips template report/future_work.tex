\subsection{Data selection}
As discussed in section \ref{sec:ubuntudata}, the Ubuntu Chat Corpora does not contain a sufficient amount of emoticons for training. It has not been proven weather the artificial relabeling of the data has had a impact on the performance of the Hidden Markov Model, but it is believed that tests should be also performed using another training corpora in order to compare the performance. \red{suggestions on what data? I mentioned skype data earlier just for example, but maybe somebody has seen something in a paper to cite here?}


\subsection{Feature selection}

As mentioned earlier in this paper, feature selection is crucial for the emoticon prediction in text, just like it is in every prediction problem. It is believed that further exploration of the feature space could lead to much better results. A bigger set of features is discussed in \cite{fairytales}. Although a different type of data is used for this research, some of the discussed features might be applicable in other settings too.

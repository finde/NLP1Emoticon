Emoticon prediction in text is a problem closely related to opinion mining, sentiment analysis and reputation extraction. This article discusses the technique of predicting emoticons in a sequence of messages. This sequence of messages contains multiple messages which are related to one another. Using the predicted emoticon of the previous message, the emoticon of a message can be predicted. This lead to the use of a Hidden Markov Model and the Viterbi decoding algorithm.

Emoticon prediction in text is a problem closely related to opinion mining, sentiment analysis and reputation extraction. This article discusses two different techniques for predicting emoticons. In the first case, emoticons are predicted based on a single, short message. This lead to the use of an average multiclass perceptron. In the second case, emoticons are predicted, using messages posted in the past. This leads to the previous message also determining the emotion of the message analyzed. This lead to the use of a Hidden Markov Model and the Viterbi decoding algorithm.

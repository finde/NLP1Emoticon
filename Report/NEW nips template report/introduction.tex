This report discusses emoticon prediction, based on a sequence of messages. In order to find messages that are related to one another and can transition in positivity to negativity, an entire conversation is observed. Each message is classified by not only considering the features of a single message, but also by considering the previous messages of the same author. This problem is a complex and interesting one, since it also takes into account the transitions from one state to another.

\noindent In order to find messages with such transitions, a corpora containing longer sequences of text messages are used - these might be conversations, such as an e-mail exchange or simply chat data, as long as the corpora contains a sufficient amount of emoticons. As emoticons appear in chat data more often, Ubuntu chat data is used. Unfortunately, due to the lack of emoticons in this specific corpora, the emoticons of all other sentences must also be determined. In order to label the corpora, another model must be trained. In order to train this model, a corpora of short, unrelated messages that are filled with emoticons is used. In order to find such messages, Twitter \cite{twittersentiment} data is used. Therefore, the Twitter data is used to train a model. This model is then used to label the Ubuntu chat data \cite{ubuntudata}. 

\noindent After the data is collected, it is first preprocessed. Then, appropriate features are extracted and a model is trained. The current report does not discuss the choice of features in detail. Basic features were chosen for this project without any intentional aim on improving this selection. Since this task on its own can take up years, it is left as future work. However, suggestions about improving features are mentioned in the following sections.

\noindent In order to classify the data, classes must be determined. Three classes are used to classify the data. Table \ref{tab:classes} displays these classes and the corresponding emoticons, contained in this type of data.

% Maybe put this in the general part, since it is the same for both problems?

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{\bf DATA CLASS}  &\multicolumn{1}{l}{\bf EXAMPLE EMOTICONS}
\\ \hline \\
positive 			& :) \: \:  			:] \: \: 		=) \: \: 		:D  	\\
neutral 				& :$\vert$ \: \: 	o\_o  								\\
negative 			& :( \: \: 			:[ \: \: 		=( \: \: 		;( 		\\
\end{tabular}{}
\end{center}
\end{table}

As table \ref{tab:classes} shows, this selection of emoticons displays positive, negative and neutral emotions. However, this data can be split further into extremely positive ( :D ) and extremely negative ( $>:($ ) emoticons for more specific classification of messages. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper.

This report discusses two related, but essentially different problems - emoticon prediction based on a single short message and based on a sequence of messages. In the first problem, short, unrelated messages are observed. Their emoticons are used to determine whether a message is positive or negative. Using this information, a is trained. Eventually, a new message can be passed and the corresponding emotion is predicted. In order to determine the sentiment of a message optimally and achieve generalization, messages of different authors are collected and used to train the classifier. In the second problem, an entire conversation is observed. Each message is classified by not only considering the features of a single message, but also by considering the previous messages of the same author. This problem is a more complex and interesting one, since it also takes into account the transitions from one sentiment state to another. \\

\noindent As a natural consequence of the above statements of the two problems, different data sets are used to approach each problem. For the first problem, any corpora of text messages containing emoticons can be used. Such corpora can contain unrelated messages. In order to find short unrelated messages, Twitter data is used. For the second problem, a corpora containing longer sequences of text messages are used - these might be conversations, such as an e-mail exchange or simply chat data, as long as the corpora contains a sufficient amount of emoticons. As emoticons appear in chat data more often, Ubuntu chat data is used. \\

\noindent After the data is collected, it is first preprocessed. Then, appropriate features are extracted and a model is trained. The current report does not discuss the choice of features in detail. Basic feature were chosen for this project without intentional aim on improving them. Since this task on its own can take up years, it is left as future work. However, suggestions about improving features is mentioned in the following sections. \\

\noindent In order to classify the data, classes must be determined. Three classes are used to classify the data. Table \ref{tab:classes} displays these classes and the corresponding emoticons, contained in this type of data.

% TODO: Fix the emoticon examples to match the emoticons actually used
\item \textbf{positive} - data containing `positive' emoticons (expressing positive emotions) such as `:)', `:]', `=)', or `:D'
\item \textbf{neutral} - data containing no emoticons or neutral emoticons like `:$\vert$' or `o\_o'
\item \textbf{negative} - data containing `negative' emoticons (expressing negative emotions) such as `:(', `:[', `=(` or `;('

As table \ref{tab:classes} shows, known emoticons display positive, negative and neutral emotions. However, this data can be split further into extremely positive ( :D ) and extremely negative ( >:( ) emoticons for more specific classification of messages. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper and is further mentioned in future work.

In this part of the project the Ububntu Chat Corpus was used as training data \red{SOME REFERENCE HERE}. This corpus consists of archived chat logs  from Ubuntu's Internet Relay Chat technical support channels \red {Reference}. The logs contain continuous conversations, where numerous people take part in the conversation. Some people only post a couple of messages, whereas others take more active part in the conversations.

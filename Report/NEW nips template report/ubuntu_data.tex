In this part of the project the Ubuntu Chat Corpus was used as training data \red{SOME REFERENCE HERE}. This corpus consists of archived chat logs from Ubuntu's Internet Relay Chat technical support channels \red {Reference}. The logs contain continuous conversations, where numerous people take part in the conversation. Some people only post a few messages, whereas others participate more actively in the conversations. 

\subsubsection*{Relabeling the data} 
Since this data contains mainly technical conversations, there appeared to be a significant lack of emoticons. This means that the majority of the messages were labeled as `neutral', which in turn implies a terrible prediction performance. In order to still be able to use this data and test the prediction performance, a decision was made to relabel the data. For every `neutral' message, an emoticon was predicted using the AMP discussed in section \ref{sec:twitter}. This lead to the possession of data containing enough emoticons to properly train a model and predict new examples. In order to avoid such artificial relabeling of the data in other projects, corpora from a more appropriate source should be used - e.g. Skype conversation logs or any other group chat logs.

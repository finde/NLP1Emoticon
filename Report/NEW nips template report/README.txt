The code contains the following files:
1. AveragedMulticlassPerceptron.py -- Contains an average multiclass perceptron
2. Clustering.py -- Performs clustering of feature vectors in order to calculate the transition and emission probabilities
3. DataFarmer.py -- Contains the Twitter crawler
4. DataPoint.py -- Class to store Twitter datapoints in
5. DataPreprocessor.py -- Preprocesses data
6. decoding.py -- Performs decoding, using the Viterbi algorithm
7. Dictionary.py -- Contains dictionaries of positive and negative words which helps classify words
8. getData.py -- Gets data from files
9. HMM.py -- The HMM implementation
10. MultilayerPerceptron.py -- Implementation of the multilayer perceptron. This is unstable, but we felt to add it as it took up a lot of our time.
11. TrainingData.py -- Collects training data
12. TSVParser.py -- Parses TSV data so it can be used for processing
13. wrapper.py -- Wrapper which uses the HMM to predict labels
